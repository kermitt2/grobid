The outcome of <lb/>such procedures heavily depends on accurate placement of the needle. There are two <lb/>main challenges to achieve high accuracy: First, aligning the needle with the targeted lesion, <lb/>and second, compensating for the deflection of the needle in the tissue. In order to address <lb/>these challenges, scientists have developed several robotic setups for needle steering. <lb/>However, the subject is still under research and reliable implementations which can be used <lb/>in clinical practice are not yet available. In this paper, we have taken some steps in order to <lb/>bring needle steering closer to practice. A new hybrid control algorithm is developed, which <lb/>enables us to control a flexible needle by combing base-manipulation and beveled-tip steer-<lb/>ing methods. A pre-operative path planner is developed which considers the clinical require-<lb/>ments. The proposed method is tested in the lung of a fresh-frozen human cadaver. The <lb/>work-flow of the experiments are similar to the current clinical practice. Three experimental <lb/>cases are used to evaluate the proposed steering algorithm. Experimental Case I shows <lb/>that using the proposed steering algorithm controllability of the needle is increased. In Case <lb/>II and Case III, the needle is steered in a gelatin phantom and a human cadaver, respec-<lb/>tively. The targeting accuracy of 1.35±0.49mm in gelatin phantom and 1.97±0.89mm in <lb/>cadave is achieved. A feasibility study is performed, in which a fine needle aspiration (FNA) <lb/>needle is steered in the lungs of a human cadaver under computed tomography guidance. <lb/>The targeting error for the feasibility study is 2.89±0.22mm. The results suggest that such a <lb/>robotic system can be beneficial for clinical use and the patient receives less x-ray radiation. <lb/></front>

			<body>deaths in 2012) [1]. In the United States and Europe lung cancer screening with computed <lb/>tomography (CT) is recommended for people at high risk or within clinical trial settings [2, 3]. <lb/>CT-guided lung biopsy is often performed for the nodules greater than 10mm, and for small <lb/>fast-growing nodules. The CT images are used to locate the lung nodule and then the needle is <lb/>advanced into the subcutaneous tissue incrementally. A CT scan is acquired after every needle <lb/>manipulation. This procedure is commonly performed manually by clinicians, and can result <lb/>in complications such as pneumothorax and pulmonary hemorrhage [4-6]. Core needle <lb/>biopsy (CNB) or fine needle aspiration (FNA) is used to cut a core for pathological analysis, or <lb/>to aspirate cell clusters for cytological analysis, respectively. CNB is often reported to result in <lb/>a higher diagnostic performance, but FNA has a lower complication rate [7, 8]. <lb/>Although accurate localization of lesions is possible using current imaging technology, <lb/>those cannot yet be precisely targeted, because of the following issues: <lb/>1. The needle tends to deflect from its initial path because of the asymmetric tip. <lb/>2. The nodule moves due to physiological motions such as respiration. <lb/>The needle deflection can be used to correct the initial orientation error during the inser-<lb/>tion of the needle by rotating the base of the needle. This will not only decrease the amount <lb/>of needle manipulations, but also enables the clinicians to target even small lung nodules. In <lb/>order to apply such a solution for steering, robotic setups such the one presented in Fig 1 can <lb/>be used. In order to address the second issue, breathing instructions are often given to the <lb/>patient prior to the procedure to minimize the movement. The patient is asked to hold breath <lb/>in a consistent fashion if the nodule is close to the diaphragm, and therefore, the motion of the <lb/>nodule will be minimal [9]. Researchers have developed several robotic setups in order to assist <lb/>clinicians perform needle placement accurately. The literature suggests that such systems can <lb/>be beneficial for clinical use which are discussed below. <lb/>1.1 Related work <lb/>Different robotic setups, needles and steering algorithms have been developed in order to min-<lb/>imize the lesion targeting error and tissue damage. We discuss some of the relevant approaches <lb/>below. <lb/>1.1.1 Needle steering. The needle steering methods can be categorized by the type of nee-<lb/>dle that is used. The needles can be either passive (such as symmetric tip [10], bevel-tipped <lb/>[11], pre-bent/curved tip [12]) or active (such as programmable-bevel [13] and tendon-actu-<lb/>ated tip [14]). The advantage of passive needles over active needles is that their design is rather <lb/>simple. Therefore, those can be used in clinical practice easier and with lower costs. The deflec-<lb/>tion of bevel-tipped needles (and therefore controllability) is lower than pre-bent/curved tip <lb/>needles [12]. However, the bevel-tipped needles are currently in use for clinical application, <lb/>and therefore it is beneficial if the same needle can be used for steering. <lb/>Several methods have been developed to steer bevel-tipped needles. Minhas et al. intro-<lb/>duced the duty-cycling algorithm which allows to control the curvature of the trajectory by <lb/>spinning the needle [15]. However, the tissue damage is high in this method because of high <lb/>number of needle rotations. Abayazid et al. developed an algorithm that uses the reachable vol-<lb/>ume of the needle in order to minimize the needle rotations [16]. In this method, the curvature <lb/>cannot be controlled but the tissue damage is minimal. Relevant literature also showed that <lb/>symmetric tip needles can be steered by manipulating its base [10, 17, 18]. However, the force <lb/>applied to the tissue, especially at the insertion point, is high and could tear the tissue. There-<lb/>fore, we have developed a steering algorithm that introduces minimal tissue damage, while the <lb/>curvature can be controlled. The algorithm tries to keep the needle on a pre-generated path. <lb/></body>

			<body>1.1.2 Path planning. Several path planning algorithms have been developed for needle <lb/>steering purposes. Alterovitz et al. developed a 2D path planner using Markov Decision Pro-<lb/>cess (MPD) [19]. This planner prioritized success probability over distance and rotation <lb/>minimization. Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) algorithm was used in several stud-<lb/>ies. Bernardes et al. [20] and Patil et al. [21] used duty-cycling method with RRT path plan-<lb/>ning in 2D and 3D environments, respectively. Abayazid et al. also used RRT to generate <lb/>milestones along the optimal path, and steer the needle towards these milestones [16]. The <lb/>proposed RRT-based algorithms are relatively fast, which makes them suitable for real-time <lb/>application. The objective in all of these studies were to find a suitable path from the inser-<lb/>tion point of the needle to the target. This approach is applicable only if the final configura-<lb/>tion of the needle is not of importance. However, depending on the position of the nodule, it <lb/>is important that the needle reaches the target in a specific configuration in clinical practice. <lb/>For instance, if the nodule is close to an artery or the heart, the clinicians choose to insert <lb/>the needle in a direction to maximize the safety of the patient and minimize the chance of <lb/>hitting the sensitive organs. Therefore, we have developed a pre-operative path planner in <lb/>which the preferred final direction that the needle enters the nodule, and the insertion region <lb/>are considered. <lb/>1.2 Contributions <lb/>In this work, we have proposed a new hybrid steering algorithm in which we combine two <lb/>methods in order to achieve high deflection. In this new algorithm a bevel-tipped needle is <lb/>steered using the tip steering and a modified version of base-manipulation algorithm. We have <lb/>used a previously developed CT-compatible robotic system, which has a remote-center-of-<lb/>motion (RCM). The RCM enables us to apply the developed algorithm. The experiments are <lb/>performed in a CT scanner in the lungs of a human cadaver in order to validate our method in <lb/>a completely realistic scenario. This is a key step in bringing needle steering into clinical prac-<lb/>tice. A pre-operative path planner is developed which provides us the feasible paths to the tar-<lb/>get, considering the final orientation of the needle and preferred insertion region. We have <lb/>Fig 1. The experimental setup used for robotically steering a fine needle aspiration (FNA) needle in a fresh-frozen <lb/>human cadaver. The needle is steered towards virtual targets in the lung. Computed tomography (CT) images are used <lb/>to select the target and the insertion region, and register the target location with respect to the robot reference frame. <lb/>The experimental setup consists of: ① Needle insertion device. ② Fresh-frozen human cadaver. ③ Control boards. ④ <lb/>CT scanner. ⑤ Fiducial sticker on the cadaver. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210052.g001 <lb/></body>

			<body>used clinical FNA needles for the experiments, which show the developed algorithm can be <lb/>used with common clinical needles, and thus there is no need for specific needle designs. <lb/>The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the developed steering and pre-oper-<lb/>ative path planning algorithms. The experimental setup, plan and results are presented in sec-<lb/>tion III. Finally, in section IV, we conclude our work and suggest directions for future work. <lb/>2 Methods <lb/>This section presents our hybrid control algorithm which combines tip steering and local-<lb/>manipulation algorithm. This is followed by describing the pre-operative 3D path planning <lb/>algorithm. <lb/>2.1 Hybrid needle deflection model <lb/>The deflection of bevel-tipped needles using only tip steering methods is low, especially if thick <lb/>needles are used. For instance, the radius of curvature for a 22G FNA needle is around 292mm <lb/>in the breast tissue. Base-manipulation has the advantage of increasing the needle deflection. <lb/>However, the current approach of the base-manipulation technique causes tissue damage [22]. <lb/>The shear forces are high at the insertion point because the base of the needle is manipulated <lb/>and there is no mechanism to minimize the movement of the needle at the insertion point. We <lb/>present in this section, a new hybrid control algorithm which combines the bevel-tipped nee-<lb/>dle steering with a modified version of the base-manipulation method. In order to apply the <lb/>hybrid control, we have developed a needle steering robot with a remote-center-of-motion <lb/>mechanism. The robot enables us to manipulate the orientation of the needle, while keeping <lb/>the insertion point fixed. This results in an increase in the deflection of the bevel-tipped needle, <lb/>while the tissue damage at the insertion point is reduced. The formulation of the new needle <lb/>manipulation technique, which we have called local-manipulation is described below. <lb/>Needle-tissue interaction can be modeled locally using virtual springs placed along the nee-<lb/>dle shaft [22]. The needle is divided into N segments, and a spring is attached to the end of <lb/>each segment as depicted in Fig 2. This segmentation is performed only for the part of the nee-<lb/>dle which is inside the tissue. Each segment can be approximated by a 3D polynomial curve <lb/>(S i ðlÞ 2 R 3 ) where i 2 [1, N] is the index. Variable (l 2 [0, L i ]) is a point on the segment with L i <lb/>being the segment arc length. Boundary conditions are applied to the segments to find the <lb/>polynomial curve coefficients. The second order continuity can be formulated as follows: <lb/>S i ðLÞ ¼ S iþ1 ð0Þ; <lb/>ð1Þ <lb/>dS i <lb/>dl <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>l¼L i <lb/>¼ <lb/>dS iþ1 <lb/>dl <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>l¼0 <lb/>; <lb/>ð2Þ <lb/>d 2 S i <lb/>dl 2 <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>l¼L i <lb/>¼ <lb/>d 2 S iþ1 <lb/>dl 2 <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>l¼0 <lb/>: <lb/>ð3Þ <lb/>The insertion point of the needle is fixed due to the RCM design of the robot, which results in <lb/>S 1 (0) = 0. The bending moment at the last element (M tip 2 R 3�1 ) is related to the bevel at the <lb/>tip and results in <lb/>M tip ¼ <lb/>d 2 S N <lb/>dl 2 <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>l¼L N <lb/>: <lb/>ð4Þ <lb/></body>

			<body>The force at the end of each segment (F i 2 R 3�1 ) is directly proportional to the displacement <lb/>of the needle at that point with respect to its initial position <lb/>F i ¼ K i ðP t;i À P 0;i Þ; <lb/>ð5Þ <lb/>where K i 2 R is the virtual spring coefficient and depends on the tissue properties. The initial <lb/>position and position at time (t) of the needle in 3D space are denoted by P 0;i 2 R 3�1 and <lb/>P t;i 2 R 3�1 , respectively. Therefore, the shear force along the segment can be written as <lb/>EI <lb/>d 3 S i <lb/>dl 3 <lb/>ðlÞ ¼ À F i : <lb/>ð6Þ <lb/>Parameter (E) is the needle Young&apos;s modulus and I is the second moment of area.

Bevel angle and cut angle are denoted by <lb/>a 2 R and b 2 R, respectively. Variables (a 2 R) and (b 2 R) are related to the tip shape and <lb/>are shown in Fig 2. The Eqs (8) and (9) can then be substituted in Eqs (6) and (4), respectively. <lb/>Finally, we have 12 × N unknowns and the same number of equations. Therefore, forward or <lb/>inverse kinematics can be solved as a linear equation. This results in a single control law which <lb/>includes both the base-manipulation algorithm and also the tip-steering algorithm. In the for-<lb/>ward kinematics, the angle of the needle at the insertion point is known and the angle of the <lb/>tip is calculated. In the inverse kinematics, the desired direction of motion of the tip is known <lb/>and the corresponding needle angle at the insertion point is calculated. <lb/>2.2 3D pre-operative path planning <lb/>The path planning is performed pre-operatively using a 3D scan of the tissue, and the compu-<lb/>tation time is not critical. Therefore, we have developed an algorithm which can be categorized <lb/>as a sampling-based path planning. The path planner uses the needle-tissue interaction model <lb/>to find all the feasible paths to reach the target with the pre-defined orientation and intersect <lb/>these paths with the surface (skin). In order to generate the paths, the needle trajectory for a <lb/>single insertion (no rotation) for a defined length is sampled. These points are called sample <lb/>points. These sample points are generated using the needle-tissue interaction model. The sam-<lb/>ple points can be rotated in order to achieve all possible trajectories in 3D space. The resolu-<lb/>tion of samples and rotations are the key factors influencing the time needed to generate the <lb/>final path. The paths from the target to the surface (skin) are divided into equally spaced sec-<lb/>tion. The number of sections can be set by the user and it depends on the insertion length. Fig <lb/>3 shows the algorithm for a simplified 2D case. The needle-tissue interaction model depends <lb/>on several system parameters, such as tissue stiffness, needle bevel angle and needle Young&apos;s <lb/>modulus. These parameters are estimated pre-operatively. <lb/>3 Experiments <lb/>This section describes the experiments performed to assess the proposed needle steering and <lb/>path planning algorithms. The experimental setup and plan are presented below, followed by <lb/>the results at the end of the section. <lb/>3.1 Experimental setup <lb/>A CT-compatible robotic setup with RCM resign is used to steer a bevel-tipped needle. The <lb/>robot has 4 degrees-of-freedom (DOF), which are shown in Fig 4. Two DOFs are used to insert <lb/>and rotate the needle along its shaft, and the needle can rotate around the insertion point <lb/>using the remaining two DOFs. The RCM mechanism enables us to apply the hybrid steering <lb/>algorithm to minimize the tissue damage at the insertion point. Additional details regarding <lb/>the design and specifications of our setup are provided by Shahriari et al. [24, 25]. <lb/>Two types of needles are used in different experiments. The first needle is Aurora Needle <lb/>610062, which is a 2-part needle. It has cannula diameter of 0.83mm (21G) and stylet diameter <lb/>of 0.55 mm (23.5G), and it is equipped with a 5 DOF EM sensor. In these experiments only the <lb/></body>

			<body>stylet is used in order to achieve more flexibility. An Aurora v3 (Northern Digital Inc., Water-<lb/>loo, Canada) EM tracker is used to track the sensor. The EM tracker measures the 3D position, <lb/>and pitch/yaw angles with an accuracy of 0.7mm and 0.2˚, respectively. The motor encoder is <lb/>used to measure the roll angle (rotation about needle axis). The second needle is an FNA spinal <lb/>biopsy needle with outer diameter of 0.66mm (22G) (Argon Medical Devices, Plano, USA). A <lb/>Siemens Somatom Force (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) is used to track the needle and <lb/>find the target location. The settings are the defaults used for abdomen scan, which are a tube <lb/>Fig 3. 2D of the proposed 3D path planner.

			<body>voltage of 90KVP, tube current of 234mAs, pixel spacing of 0.96mm, slice thickness of 0.5mm <lb/>and convolution kernel of Br40d. <lb/>The procedure was performed on a normal-sized male cadaver (died at the age of 73 years) <lb/>from the Groningen Human Body Donation Program. The body had no lung pathology, and <lb/>had not undergone surgical procedures on the thorax. After death, the body was shaved. The <lb/>cadaver was fast frozen to -40˚C, then stored at -24˚C. Two days prior to the study the body <lb/>was defrosted to room temperature. The internal ethics committee of the Groningen Human <lb/>Body Donation Program approved the use of the body. <lb/>3.2 Experimental plan <lb/>Three experimental cases and one feasibility study are conducted to evaluate the proposed <lb/>algorithms. In all the experiments, the needle is inserted into the tissue with a fixed velocity of <lb/>1mm/s. <lb/>Case I. An FNA needle is inserted into a gelatin phantom using bevel-tip steering and the <lb/>hybrid steering. The target is placed in an unreachable distance (100mm away from the needle) <lb/>on x-axis (Fig 4,④) for both methods. This causes the control algorithms to produce the maxi-<lb/>mum deflection in order to minimize the error. The gelatin phantom is made by mixing 14.9% <lb/>(by-weight) porcine gelatin powder (Dr. Oetker, Ede, The Netherlands) with 85.1% water. <lb/>This mixture results in a phantom with a Young&apos;s modulus of 35 kPa, which is similar to breat <lb/>tissue [26]. Lung tissue is very soft and results in sub-millimeter deflection for the aforemen-<lb/>tioned needle if bevel-tip steering is used. This results in noisy and not robust curvature esti-<lb/>mation. Breast tissue is stiffer than the lung tissue, which could result in more deflection for <lb/>both methods. This helps to compare the proposed hybrid algorithm with the conventional <lb/>algorithm. The amount of needle deflection in the two cases are compared. The results are <lb/>used to validate that hybrid steering can result in a higher deflection of the needle. <lb/>Case II. The path planning algorithm and the hybrid steering is first tested in an anthro-<lb/>pomorphic gelatin phantom of the thorax. The experiments are performed using CT images. <lb/>An sticker is attached to the phantom, which has 7 cylindrical shape fiducials on it. A CT scan <lb/>is performed and the fiducials are extracted from the CT images and the skin surface is recon-<lb/>structed. The target and the final angle is selected and the path planning is executed. The suit-<lb/>able insertion point, and therefore the path, is selected by the user from the feasible option that <lb/>the path planner provides. Considering the insertion depth, the number of intermediate sec-<lb/>tion of the path planner is set to five. The insertion point is marked using the laser system of <lb/>the CT scanner and the fiducial sticker. The robot is then placed at the insertion point accord-<lb/>ingly, and a new CT scan is performed (Fig 4a). The fiducials on the robot are used to register <lb/>the robot in the CT scanner reference frame. The insertion is then performed automatically <lb/>and a final CT scan is taken to check the error. The work-flow of the experiment is depicted in <lb/>Fig 5. <lb/>Case III. A needle equipped with an electromagnetic (EM) sensor is steered towards a vir-<lb/>tual target in fresh-frozen human cadaver. In this experiment, the needle is tracked in real-<lb/>time using an EM tracker, and the needle controlled using the hybrid steering method. In this <lb/>case, the skin is perforated using a surgical scalpel blade, in order to minimize skin influence <lb/>on the needle trajectory and to avoid damaging of the needle&apos;s tip. The insertion point is <lb/>altered for each insertion. The experimental setup is presented in Fig 4. Experimental Case II <lb/>and Case III are summarized in Table 1. <lb/>Feasibility study. In this study, we try to resemble the clinical conditions to evaluate our <lb/>system in a realistic setup.

The skin is perfo-<lb/>rated using a surgical scalpel blade in this case as well. <lb/>3.3 Results <lb/>In the experimental Case I, the tip steering is compared with hybrid steering. Each method <lb/>is repeated 5 times and the radius of curvature is measured. The radius of curvature is <lb/>Registration <lb/>Fig 5. The work-flow of the experiments using the needle insertion device (NID) is as similar as possible to the <lb/>clinical practice. The radiation symbol (☢) represents a single computed tomography (CT) scan performed. In clinic, <lb/>aligning the needle with the lesion is challenging. This results in several needle manipulations and CT scans, which is <lb/>visualized by the red area. This issue is solved using the NID, where the fiducials on the robot are used to calculate the <lb/>robot pose which aligns the needle with the lesion. The pre-operative path planner provides the insertion point. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210052.g005 <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>289.6 ± 7.2mm for the tip steering and 155.8 ± 8.7mm for the hybrid steering. This means <lb/>around 17mm of deflection in 10cm of insertion in comparison with approximately 39mm of <lb/>deflection. This results show that hybrid steering can improve the amount of deflection and <lb/>therefore the controlability. The results are presented in Fig 6. In experimental Case II, the nee-<lb/>dle is steered towards 5 real targets. The targets are spheres with a radius ranging between <lb/>3mm to 8mm, and these are placed randomly in the phantom. The needle is steered towards <lb/>the center of the targets. The error is calculated as the absolute distance between the target and <lb/>needle tip position in 3D space, and also the final angular error. The error is calculated by per-<lb/>forming a final CT scan. The mean targeting error is 1.35±0.49mm. The results are presented <lb/>in Table 2 and Fig 7. In experimental Case III, the targets are virtual points in 3D space within <lb/>the cadaver lung, and the locations are chosen randomly. The steering experiments are <lb/>repeated 5 times. The mean targeting error is 1.97±0.89mm and the results are available in <lb/>Table 2. The feasibility study is performed twice and the needle is steered towards virtual tar-<lb/>gets within the lung. A reconstructed 3D visualization of the second feasibiliy study is shown <lb/>Fig 6. Experimental Case I: The needle is steered using tip and hybrid steering algorithms. This figure <lb/>demonstrates a representative measurement for tip steering (blue) and hybrid steering (red). The axis x and z are <lb/>according to the coordinate shown in Fig 4. The data points demonstrated with square shapes are the needle tip <lb/>positioned measured using an electromagnetic tracker. The solid lines are arcs with corresponding radius of curvature. <lb/>The radius of curvature (R) shows a decrease when using the hybrid control, which results in higher controllability of <lb/>needle trajectory with respect to tip steering. The steering is performed 5 times for each method, which results in <lb/>radius of curvature of 289.6 ± 7.2mm and 155.8 ± 8.7mm for tip and hybrid steering, respectively. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210052.g006 <lb/>Table 2. Experimental results: The results of the experimental Case II and Case III are presented. The target location, and error for each case are indicated. The error is <lb/>calculated as the absolute distance between the tip of the needle and the center of the target. The mean and standard deviation of the error for each experimental scenario <lb/>are presented separately. Radius of curvature (R) is calculated for the first 25mm of insertion.

			<body>in Fig 8(a). The needle trajectory for the same experiments is shown in Fig 8(b), where the nee-<lb/>dle is pointed by the green arrows. The mean targeting error for the feasibility study is 2.89 <lb/>±0.22mm. The radius of curvature for the two insertions are 223.74mm and 184.57mm, <lb/>respectively. The radius of curvature is calculated based on the first 25mm section of the nee-<lb/>dle, where the effect of hybrid steering is better visible. It is worth mentioning that the radius <lb/>of curvature is not defined for the needle as a whole, since the trajectory is in 3D space and cur-<lb/>vature could only be calculated locally. <lb/>4 Discussion and future work <lb/>In this study, we have presented a new algorithm to steer a flexible needle by combining tip-<lb/>based control with the base-manipulation control. The algorithm is developed for a CT-com-<lb/>patible needle insertion setup, which has a remote-center-of-motion at the point of insertion. <lb/>The combination of the robotic setup and the developed control algorithm results in an <lb/>increase in the deflection of the needle. A pre-operative path planner is developed, in which <lb/>we consider the location of the target, the required final pose of the needle and the preferred <lb/>Fig 7.

			<body>insertion region. The path planner provides the feasible paths and the surgeon can choose the <lb/>preferred path. <lb/>4.1 Discussion <lb/>The needle steering algorithm, along with the path planner, are tested using 3 experimental <lb/>cases which are discussed below. The results of the first experimental case shows that the nee-<lb/>dle deflection has increased using the hybrid control with respect to the tip-steering. This <lb/>results in higher controlability of the needle trajectory. It is important to mention that the <lb/>deflection depends on the amount of base rotation of the needle. Therefore, the deflection can <lb/>go even higher, but the disadvantage is higher tissue damage. In these experiments we have set <lb/>a limit of 20˚on the rotation of the needle at the insertion point. In the experimental Case II, <lb/>the needle is steered towards real target in a an anthropomorphic gelatin phantom of the tho-<lb/>rax. The targeting accuracy is higher than the case with human cadaver, which is due to homo-<lb/>geneity of the gelatin phantom. The mechanical properties of the gelatin phantom is known, <lb/>and therefore the model used for steering is accurate. In experimental Case III, the tip of the <lb/>needle is tracked in real-time using the EM tracker. Therefore, the control loop is closed using <lb/>the measurements, which in principle increase the targeting accuracy. However, the needle is <lb/>steered in a human cadaver which is not homogeneous. To reach the target in the lung, the <lb/>needle has to pierce the following layers of the thoracic wall: muscle fascia, external intercostal <lb/>muscle, internal intercostal muscle, innermost intercostal muscle, endothoracic fascia, parietal <lb/>pleura, visceral pleura. The mechanical properties of these layers are different and these are <lb/>not accurately available. This results in a lower targeting accuracy with higher standard devia-<lb/>tion. In the feasibility test, the robot was positioned over the left 2nd intercostal space. The <lb/>space between the parietal and visceral pleural usually contains just a film of fluid, but with <lb/>defects of the thoracic wall (e.g. by piercing or cutting it) air can fill this space and push the <lb/>lung away (pneumothorax). Indeed, the CT-experiment showed that the pleural space was <lb/>wider than normal, possibly due to earlier experiments/punctures performed on the cadaver. <lb/>Fig 8.

			<body>This resulted in higher targeting error. The authors have showed in their previous study [25] <lb/>that fusing the real-time EM tracking data with CT images can increase the targeting accuracy. <lb/>However, in clinic, the procedures should be made as straight forward as possible for the clini-<lb/>cians, as far as the procedure could be performed with the required accuracy. In this study, it <lb/>was shown that even in absence of data fusion of CT images and a real-time sensing device, an <lb/>accuracy of around 3mm could be achieved in human tissue. The smallest lung nodules which <lb/>physicians usually try to reach with a needle, assuming a spherical shape, is about 5mm diame-<lb/>ter. This is very challenging even for experienced physicians and it involves several iterations <lb/>of insertions, retraction and manipulation of the needle. If the center of the nodule is selected <lb/>as the target, a robotic system such as the one presented here can reach targets of 6mm or <lb/>larger in one step, without the need of retraction and re-insertion of the needle. Furthermore, <lb/>the measure of the radius of curvature for Case II and the Feasibility Study shows that the <lb/>hybrid control is effective and is used during all the insertion, in the sense that higher deflec-<lb/>tion is realized. It demonstrates that even in the case of insertions into the lung (softer tissue), <lb/>still the radius of curvature is smaller than bevel-tip steering in gelatin (stiffer tissue). <lb/>4.2 Future work <lb/>In this work, we took some steps in order to use needle steering in a clinically relevant situa-<lb/>tion. We have used a work-flow similar to the protocol which is used in clinical practice. How-<lb/>ever, further experiments are needed before the setup can be used for patient studies. In the <lb/>future, we want to perform more human cadaver experiments using the CT scanner, not only <lb/>to validate the accuracy of the system, but also to evaluate the design and user-friendliness of <lb/>the setup. Furthermore, we are planning to perform several experiments on live animals in <lb/>order to check the effects of biological motions on the needle steering accuracy and trying to <lb/>compensate for the motion. <lb/></body>
