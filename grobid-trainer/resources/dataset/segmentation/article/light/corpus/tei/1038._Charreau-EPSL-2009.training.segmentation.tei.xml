In order to better understand their origin <lb/>and significance, we carried out a combined structural and magnetostratigraphic study in the <lb/>Quilitage syncline (southern Tianshan), where the base of the Xiyu conglomerates is observed <lb/>at both sides of the syncline. A balanced cross-section shows that, even at a local-scale, the <lb/>base of the Xiyu conglomerates cannot be regarded as a single continuous stratigraphic layer. <lb/>On the southern flank of the Quilitage syncline, we collected 172 samples collected for <lb/>magnetostratigraphic dating identify 17 polarity chrons that date the new section from 5.2 to <lb/>~ 1.7 Ma and constrain the base of the Xiyu conglomerate here at ~ 1.7 Ma. This is 4.2 Ma <lb/>younger than the age of the Xiyu previously found on the northern limb of the same syncline. <lb/>Together with other magnetostratigraphic studies carried out around the Tianshan, our study <lb/>unambiguously demonstrates that the onset of deposition of the Xiyu conglomerates is <lb/>diachronous, and that the conglomerates are systematically younger toward the basin. <lb/>Consequently, the Xiyu Formation should not be considered as a chronostratigraphic marker <lb/>related to any particular tectonic or climatic event, but is instead a prograding gravel wedge <lb/>that has prograded over the underthrusting forelands. A synthesis of chronologic and <lb/>structural results yields progradation rates over the last 10 Ma on the order of ~ 2.0 mm/yr <lb/>and ~ 3.9 mm/yr south and north of the Tianshan Mountains respectively. These rates are <lb/>comparable to the shortening rate across the Tianshan range, suggesting that underthrusting is <lb/>the main factor governing the progradation rate of the Xiyu Formation. <lb/>Keywords: Xiyu Formation; magnetostratigraphy; Tianshan; gravel wedge progradation; <lb/>shortening rates <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>As a mountain range grows surface processes become more active and result in a mass <lb/>transfer from the uplifted zone to the flanking lowlands. This mass transfer depends on <lb/>climate and can significantly influence tectonics by contributing to uplift or subsidence <lb/>through isostatic compensation ([Beaumont et al., 1988], [Cobbold et al., 1993], [Molnar and <lb/>England, 1990], [Schlunegger et al., 1997] and [Whipple and Meade, 2006]), and bears on <lb/>deformation and thermal structure by its effect on heat advection ([Avouac and Burov, 1996], <lb/>[Batt and Braun, 1997], [Beaumont et al., 1994] and [Jamieson and Beaumont, 1988]). <lb/>Mountain building is, therefore, a complex process resulting from coupling between tectonic <lb/>deformation, climate and surface processes ([Avouac and Burov, 1996], [Burbank, 1992], <lb/>[Koons, 1987] and [Molnar and England, 1990]). Foreland basin sediments thus provide a <lb/>record of this process in which the respective influence of tectonics and climate is often <lb/>difficult to untangle. <lb/>The Tarim and Junggar basins in central Asia (Fig. 1) accumulate eroded materials from the <lb/>nearby Tianshan mountains. As closed intracontinental basins, their thick Cenozoic <lb/>sedimentary cover represents prime examples where one can estimate the mass eroded from <lb/>the mountain and thus quantify transfer processes. Folding and thrusting on both the northern <lb/>and southern piedmonts expose exceptional outcrops of the sediments at numerous sections. <lb/>In both basins, the top of the sedimentary fill consists of remarkably thick dark gravels, called <lb/>the Xiyu Formation (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), that one can be used to quantify mass transfer across <lb/>the basins. <lb/>In 1953, Chinese geologist C.L. Fang and his colleagues found a vertebrate fossil of Equus <lb/>sanmeniensis in the Anjihaihe section at the transition between the Dushanzi and the Xiyu <lb/>Formations (Fig. 1). This fossil was dated from 2.48 Ma to the early Pleistocene ([Chen et al., <lb/>1994], [Feng and Dai, 2004], [Gaboardi et al., 2005] and [Zhu et al., 2004]). Xiyu-type <lb/>conglomerates are widely distributed along the periphery of the major mountain ranges in <lb/>central Asia (Fig. 1), and are commonly lithostratigraphically assigned to the early <lb/>Pleistocene Xiyu Formation throughout central Asia ([Huang et al., 2006], [Sun et al., 2007] <lb/>and [Sun et al., 2004]). The age designation stemming from the finding of E. sanmeniensis in <lb/>the Anjihaihe section has thus had considerable impact. Some workers argue that the <lb/>conglomerate would signify a late Plio-Pleistocene acceleration in uplift of the Tianshan <lb/>(Burchfiel et al., 1999) or of the Tibet Plateau (Zheng et al., 2000). Alternatively, since the <lb/>Plio-Pleistocene transition is characterized by a transition to widespread glaciation after a <lb/>relatively warm period during the Mio-Pliocene ([Zachos et al., 2001] and [Zhang et al., <lb/>2001]), other workers argue that the Xiyu Formation must be linked to climate change ([Liu et <lb/>al., 1996] and [Zhang et al., 2001]). <lb/> Recent magnetostratigraphic studies show that the basal age of the Xiyu conglomerate could <lb/>be much older (by up to ~ 15 Ma) than the early Pleistocene ([Charreau et al., 2009], <lb/>[Charreau et al., 2005] and [Heermance et al., 2007]). However, others studies still assume a <lb/>Pleistocene age ([Huang et al., 2006], [Sun et al., 2007] and [Sun et al., 2004]). As the studied <lb/>
            localities are often far apart and because the definition of the Xiyu Formation is loose, the <lb/>depositional age and the origin of the Xiyu conglomerates remain a matter of controversy. <lb/>Resolving this debate (e.g. Charreau et al., 2008b) would bring important implications <lb/>regarding regional tectonics and late Cenozoic climate change. <lb/>The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to clarify the definition of the Xiyu Formation and <lb/>accurately determine its age range. Our analysis is based on existing magnetostratigraphic <lb/>constraints and new results acquired from a section along the Yaha River, in the southern <lb/>Tianshan piedmont, which, thanks to a singular tectonic setting, unambiguously demonstrates <lb/>the diachronism of the Xiyu conglomerates at a local-scale. <lb/>Hereafter, we first give an overview of the regional geological setting. Next, we propose a <lb/>strict sedimentological definition of the Xiyu Formation -that should provide a basis for <lb/>future work in the region -and then move onto the presentation of the results with the <lb/>magnetostratigraphic dating of the Yaha section. Finally we discuss the nature, tectonic and <lb/>climatic significance of the Xiyu conglomerates. <lb/>2. Geological setting of the Tianshan range <lb/>The Tianshan is a 2500-km-long tectonically active mountain range with an average altitude <lb/>of 2500 m and summits reaching up to 7000 m. Its geology consists of Paleozoic rocks related <lb/>to a long-lived Island Arc and subduction/collision history that started during the Devonian <lb/>and ended during the Permian time ([Burtman, 1975], [Charvet et al., 2007], [Gao et al., <lb/>1998], [Lin et al., 2008], [Wang et al., 2008] and [Windley et al., 1990]). The present high <lb/>topography mainly owes its origin to the Cenozoic reactivation of the range during the <lb/>Oligocene to late Miocene ([Avouac et al., 1993], [Bullen et al., 2003], [Bullen et al., 2001], <lb/>[Dumitru et al., 2001], [Hendrix et al., 1994], [Métivier and Gaudemer, 1997], [Sobel et al., <lb/>2006], [Sobel and Dumitru, 1997] and [Windley et al., 1990]), under the influence of the <lb/>ongoing India-Asia collision. The Tianshan range is sandwiched between two large <lb/>intracontinental basins (Fig. 1) that contain the eroded materials from the uplifting range. <lb/>
            3. Geology of the piedmonts <lb/>Both piedmonts are tectonic wedges composed of fold and thrust belts where early Mesozoic <lb/>to Quaternary sediments that were initially deposited in the foreland basin, are now <lb/>overthrusted and well exposed along numerous north-south-trending rivers (e.g. Kuitun He, <lb/>Jingou He or Yaha, Fig. 1b and c). During the 1990s, several studies focused on the structural <lb/>analysis of the Tianshan piedmonts (e.g. [Avouac et al., 1993] and [Burchfiel et al., 1999]). <lb/>More recently, numerous seismic line profiles made for exploration of gas-oil resources have <lb/>greatly improved our knowledge of the deep framework of the basins (e.g. [Charreau et al., <lb/>2008a], [Heermance et al., 2007] and [Hubert-Ferrari et al., 2007]). We focused our study in <lb/>two areas, on both sides of the range: (1) in the northern Tianshan, west of Urumqi, where the <lb/>piedmont consists of three main fold and thrust sequences that are respectively offset in a left <lb/>lateral sense from south to north (Fig. 1b), (2) in the southern Tianshan piedmont is a <lb/>2000 km-long tectonic wedge extending from the Kuche basin to the Kashi area. Our study <lb/>was carried out in the Kuche area where two anticlines can be recognized: the Quilitage <lb/>anticline and the more frontal Yakeng anticline (Fig. 1c). Seismic imaging defines the <lb/>Quilitage anticline as a 225 km-long fold bend-fault while the Yakeng anticline may be seen <lb/>as a detachment fold (see seismic line in Fig. 4 from Hubert-Ferrari et al. (2007)). Between <lb/>these anticlines and the high range, the piedmont contains several other folds and thrusts <lb/>which mainly involve Paleozoic to Mesozoic sediments. <lb/>4. Definition of the Xiyu Formation <lb/>The Xiyu conglomerates were first described by Obruchev in the 1930s. Later on, T. K. <lb/>Huang later described their lithology in more detail and classified the Xiyu (Western domain <lb/>in Chinese) Formation as all piedmont-type, conglomeratic layers composed of dark-gray to <lb/>brown-colored, coarse (3 to &gt; 30 cm) and thick (50 to 3200 m) deposits that are intercalated <lb/>with scarce yellow sandstone and mudstone layers (Zhou et al., 2000). This description <lb/>suggests the Xiyu is a coherent and continuous unit lying at the top of the sedimentary pile in <lb/>most of the central Asia&apos;s foreland basins. <lb/>
            The Xiyu conglomerates can be, however, more rigorously characterized according to their <lb/>lithology, color and sedimentary structures that typify their depositional environment. They <lb/>consist of homolithic, clast-supported, poorly to weakly sorted, massive to horizontally-and <lb/>cross-bedded conglomerates made up of pebble to blocky clasts and a coarse-grained sandy <lb/>matrix. Those conglomerates are exposed in 1 to 10s of meters-thick and 1000s of meters-<lb/>wide amalgamated strata with erosive basal boundaries. Occasionally, they contain massive to <lb/>cross-bedded, medium to coarse-grained sandstones lying within 0.1 to 1 meter-thick and 1 to <lb/>10 meter-wide lenses. Despite the poor sorting of the Xiyu deposits, their horizontal trough <lb/>crossbedded stratification indicate motion and deposition from grain-by-grain traction <lb/>sedimentation under a unidirectional upper flow regime ([Simons et al., 1965] and [Southard <lb/>and Boguchwal, 1990]). Those sediments can thus be interpreted as bed load deposits at the <lb/>base of high-velocity and turbulent water flow that generate large-scale gravelly bed-forms as <lb/>the bars formed into the gravely braided streams ([Gloppen and Steel, 1981], [Mack and <lb/>Leeder, 1999], [Miall, 1977] and [Miall, 1978]). The Xiyu Formation implies therefore the <lb/>repeated occurrences of powerful stream flows typical of gravely braided alluvial fans (Blair <lb/>and McPherson, 1994; Nemec and Postma, 1993), which still exist in the Tianshan piedmont <lb/>(Fig. 3). <lb/>At their base, the Xiyu conglomerates gradually covered the underlying units (e.g. the <lb/>Dushanzi, Kuche, Artux and Aksu formations), which are composed of finer-grained deposits <lb/>(heterolithic, clast-supported, massive and horizontal to cross-bedded conglomerates <lb/>alternating with claystone, siltstone and sandstone) due to stream flows and associated <lb/>overbank flows into a braided fluvial system. The transition between the Xiyu Formation and <lb/>the underlying sediments can be easily recognized. It may be either gradual, 100-200 m thick <lb/>on average such as at the Jingou He section (e.g. Charreau et al., 2009) with a progressive <lb/>coarsening up (Fig. 2f and g, see also Heermance et al. (2007)), or sharp but without evidence <lb/>of any hiatus (e.g. the Kuitun He section, see Charreau et al. (2005)). This transition probably <lb/>owes its origin to a shift related to an acceleration of the basinward progradation of the Xiyu <lb/>alluvial fans. A straightforward definition for the base of the Xiyu Formation is when the <lb/>content of boulder-size fraction exceeds 95% in the sediments. <lb/>
            A similar faciological transition can be observed in the present-day depositional landscape of <lb/>the Tianshan piedmonts where the limit between alluvial fan and braided rivers can be easily <lb/>outlined from satellite images and/or topographic maps (Fig. 3). <lb/>Below we present chronological constraints derived first from our new geometrically-<lb/>constrained magnetostratigraphic analysis of the upper Yaha section and then from previous <lb/>studies based on the recognition of this stratigraphic limit following the definition proposed <lb/>here. <lb/>5. Diachronous deposition of the Xiyu conglomerates in the Yaha section <lb/>The Yaha section is located on the southern flank of the Tianshan range, about 30 km east of <lb/>Kuche city, where the south-flowing Yaha River cuts the Quilitage anticline (Fig. 1c). In the <lb/>syncline located directly north of the Quilitage anticline the contact between the Xiyu <lb/>conglomerates and the underlying fine grained sandstone (Kuche Fm.) can be clearly <lb/>observed in the field on both limbs in a continuous section, along the Yaha River (Fig. 2c and <lb/>d). The section is continuously exposed and does not show any significant discordance or <lb/>faulting. This setting represents a remarkable case where the basal age of the Xiyu Formation <lb/>can be constrained at two locations along a single section. On the northern limb of the <lb/>syncline, the magnetostratigraphic study of Huang et al. (2006) has yielded a basal age of the <lb/>Xiyu conglomerate of 5.9 Ma (Fig. 2c). Note that in their paper Huang et al. (2006) identified <lb/>the thick conglomerate as Kuche formation, but we consider it as Xiyu following the above <lb/>definition. On its southern flank, Charreau et al. (2006) have magnetostratigraphically dated a <lb/>2814-m thick section, in the lower part of the series, ranging from 12.6 to 5.2 Ma, but without <lb/>reaching the base of the Xiyu Formation (Fig. 4a and b). <lb/>5.1. Structural constraints in the Quilitage syncline <lb/>The structure of the syncline was well constrained via 29 field measurements of bedding <lb/>orientation regularly distributed along a 4200-m-long section and accurately geo-referenced <lb/>with GPS (Fig. 4b and c). The strike direction remains relatively constant with a mean of <lb/>N83° (with a low circular variance of 0.071; Wan and Sandilands, 1995), consistent with <lb/>cylindrical folding. We built a section perpendicular to the mean strike with nearly all <lb/>measurement sites lying at a distance less than 150 m from the synthetic section (Fig. 4b and <lb/>c). Apparent dips were projected on this synthetic section line yet almost equal to the true <lb/>values measured on the field (Fig. 4c). These structural measurements were used to compute <lb/>the cumulative thicknesses along the section: the Xiyu Formation amounts to ~ 1052 m on the <lb/>northern limb and to only ~ 220 m on the southern one. <lb/>A hand-balanced cross section is presented in Fig. 4c. Taking into account the overall <lb/>measurements within the conglomerates, and in particular the ones surrounding the fold axis, <lb/>
            the best-fit solution results in a simple, upright syncline fold with sub-parallel strata within the <lb/>Xiyu formation. Such a structure has been extrapolated to depth in the section (cf. dash lines <lb/>on Fig. 4c). The reference horizon (thick black line on Fig. 4c), which corresponds to the base <lb/>of the Xiyu conglomerates at the southern limb, is structurally positioned far above the base <lb/>of the conglomerates on the northern flank. Moreover, the difference of cumulative <lb/>thicknesses of the Xiyu formation, from one limb to the other (~ 1052 and ~ 220 m), is rather <lb/>consequent It is therefore clear that the stratigraphic depth of the transition to the Xiyu <lb/>conglomerates varies laterally. <lb/>Therefore, one cannot structurally extend the base of the Xiyu conglomerates through a single <lb/>horizon (Fig. 4c) which strictly requires lateral sedimentological facies variations from the <lb/>homolithic Xiyu conglomerates toward a finer grained heterolithic Formation (i.e. Kuche <lb/>Fm.) from north to south (i.e. range toward basin). We observed these stratigraphic features at <lb/>the southern contact between the Xiyu and Kuche Formations (Fig. 3d). This figure shows a <lb/>lateral lithological variation within the series highlighted by thinning of the conglomerate <lb/>beds and a relative thickening of the sandstones from north to south. Thus, from a structural <lb/>viewpoint the base of the Xiyu conglomerate cannot be regarded as a synchronous and <lb/>laterally-continuous, single stratigraphic layer. <lb/>5.2. Sampling, rock magnetism and magnetostratigraphy of the upper Yaha <lb/>section <lb/>To determine the age of the base of the Xiyu Formation in the southern flank of the Quilitage <lb/>syncline, we carried out a new magnetostratigraphic section to extend upward the previously <lb/>published section of Charreau et al. (2006). To ensure stratigraphic continuity with the <lb/>previous section, the new magnetostratigraphic section was carried out in a lateral tributary of <lb/>the main Yaha River (Fig. 4b). In addition, the structural study, unraveling the cylindrical <lb/>architecture of the fold allows a perfect correlation between the magnetostratigraphic and the <lb/>structural sections (Fig. 4c). The new sampled section spans 1630 m in stratigraphic thickness <lb/>spanning a horizontal distance of 5900 m (Fig. 4b). It begins at the top end of Charreau et al.&apos;s <lb/>(2006) section and progress upwards until reaching the contact between the Xiyu and Kuche <lb/>formations. 386 cores were drilled then oriented with magnetic and sun compasses. Two or <lb/>three cores per horizon were collected with an average distance between horizons of about <lb/>
            8 m. Each horizon was positioned using a GPS instrument. Samples were collected in the <lb/>upper part of the Kuche group were composed mainly of red-muddy sandstones intercalated <lb/>with siltstone and green-gray sandstones. The average grain size becomes progressively <lb/>coarse-grained upward in the sequence, until reaching the Xiyu conglomerates. As mentioned <lb/>above, no stratigraphic duplication, unconformities or faults were visible either in field or in <lb/>seismic images (see seismic line in Fig. 4 from Hubert-Ferrari et al. (2007)), suggesting that <lb/>sedimentation was relatively continuous. Spore and pollen, such as Deltoudospora sp., <lb/>Ephedripites sp. Pinuspollonites sp., have been identified and assign a Pleistocene to Pliocene <lb/>age to the upper part of the Kuche group (Bureau of the Geological and the Mineral <lb/>Resources of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, 1985). <lb/>Curie point analyses show an important drop in magnetic susceptibility near 580 °C, followed <lb/>by a progressive decrease in susceptibility until 680 °C, signaling the presence of both <lb/>magnetite and hematite (Fig. 5a). Both thermal and alternating field demagnetization yield <lb/>similar results, although thermal demagnetization seemed more efficient (Fig. 5). Most <lb/>samples possess two components -one at low temperatures or small peak fields (&lt; 200 °C or <lb/>&lt; 10 mT) that is north and downward directed in in-situ coordinates and does not decay <lb/>toward the origin on orthogonal diagrams, and another at high temperatures or high peak <lb/>fields (300° to 680 °C or 10 to 120 mT) that is of dual polarity and does decay toward the <lb/>origin (Fig. 5c, d, e and f). We considered the high temperature/field component as the <lb/>characteristic remanent direction (ChRM). <lb/>For the about 200 samples we demagnetized, 185 possess a stable high temperature/field <lb/>component, identified as the ChRM. 52 samples have normal polarities with an average of <lb/>D = 2.8°, I = 54.5°, α 95 = 3.8°, while 103 samples have reversed polarities with an average of <lb/>D = 177.4° I = 58.8°, α 95 = 3.3°. The remaining 30 samples lie within reversal boundaries and <lb/>their directions were likely acquired in transitional fields. The reversal test is positive (Class <lb/>B, McFadden and McEhlinny (1990)). Moreover, the lower sequence in Charreau et al. (2006) <lb/>passed the fold test, so we conclude, that the high temperature/field component represents a <lb/>primary remanent magnetization. <lb/>A magnetostratigraphic sequence was established from 172 samples (horizons) possessing the <lb/>high temperature/field component which defined nine normal (a to i) and eight reverse (1 to 8) <lb/>polarity chrons (Fig. 6a, b and c), with each chron being defined by at least two samples from <lb/>two different sedimentary horizons, except for the reverse chron 1 with only one sample. We <lb/>correlated the magnetostratigraphic sequence to the Lourens et al. (2004) reference-scale <lb/>(Fig. 6d) continuing from the top of the section of Charreau et al. (2006) at 5.2 Ma. Fig. 6e <lb/>represents our preferred correlation, which provides an almost unique fit in terms of interval <lb/>number and relative duration. The only doubt in the correlation concerns the reverse chron 1 <lb/>defined by just one sample. Toward the top of the section, sedimentation becomes coarser and <lb/>
            it becomes harder to sample suitably fine-grained material within the coarse conglomerates. <lb/>The magnetic remanence becomes less stable as well. That is why the number of samples with <lb/>ChRM directions decreases toward the top. Despite this, the correlation appears robust and <lb/>delimits the sampled sediments in time from 5.2 to 1.7 Ma with a remarkably stable <lb/>sedimentary accumulation rate of 0.48 ± 0.21 mm/yr (Fig. 6e). This new section is perfectly <lb/>continuous with the underlying section (Fig. 7) of Charreau et al. (2006) which thus strongly <lb/>supports their original correlation and not the reinterpretation of Huang et al. (2006) as <lb/>explained in Charreau et al. (2008b). This ~ 4500-m-thick total section ranges from 12.6 to <lb/>1.7 Ma. It identifies a rather young, 1.7 Ma, age for the base of the Xiyu conglomerates that <lb/>lie on top of the section and shows a distinct accumulation rate change at ~ 11 Ma. A similar <lb/>acceleration rate was also observed on the north flank of the Tianshan range at ~ 11 Ma <lb/>(Charreau et al., 2008a). Hubert-Ferrari et al. (2007) have shown that the Quilitage anticline <lb/>has been active over the last ~ 5 Ma. The growth of the fold must have impacted the <lb/>sedimentary record and accumulation rates by either reducing the accommodation space <lb/>above the growing structure or increasing the accommodation space behind the structure <lb/>(through trapping of sediments in the piggy back basin). This effect can be corrected <lb/>according to a fold growth model ([Charreau et al., 2009] and [Daëron et al., 2007]). In the <lb/>present study we were not able to model this effect due to the complicated structure of the <lb/>Quilitak antlicline. <lb/>6. The Xiyu conglomerates: a prograding diachronous gravel wedge <lb/>The Yaha section clearly shows clearly that the lithological contact between Xiyu <lb/>conglomerates and their underlying sandstones observed on the southern and northern flanks <lb/>of the Quilitage syncline, just 4.7 km apart (Fig. 4), lies at different stratigraphic depths. In <lb/>addition, their estimated depositional ages are diachronous by 4.2 Ma from one limb to the <lb/>other (Fig. 4c and d). These features show that the Xiyu conglomerates grade laterally, away <lb/>from the mountain front (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). A similar pattern is observed along the Boguzihe <lb/>section, in the western part of the southern Tianshan (Chen et al., 2002), where the base of the <lb/>Xiyu conglomerates can be observed at two locations across the same Atushi-Talanghe <lb/>anticline, with depositional ages estimated at 2.8 and 1.9 Ma in less than ~ 5 km apart. An <lb/>analysis of a seismic line running across the Yakeng and Dushanzi anticlines shows important <lb/>changes in seismic character (Fig. 8a and b) that may be interpreted as due to a <lb/>sedimentological facies change from the homolithic Xiyu conglomerates to the underlying <lb/>heterolithic and finer grained Neogene deposits mainly composed of sandstones (He et al., <lb/>2005). Geometry of contacts between these two lithologies further implies a depositional <lb/>diachronism and younger age toward the basin. <lb/>
            In the southern Tianshan, across the foreland of the Kashi basin, in the western Tarim basin, <lb/>several basal ages of the Xiyu conglomerates were magnetostratigraphically dated from 15.5 <lb/>up to 0.7 Ma (Heermance et al., 2007). In the northern Tianshan piedmont, at the Jingou He <lb/>section, the limit between the Dushanzi and the Xiyu conglomerates was dated at ~ 7.6 Ma <lb/>(Charreau et al., 2009), while at the Kuitun section ~ 20 km to the north (basinward), the base <lb/>of the Xiyu conglomerates were dated at 4.8 Ma and 4.2 Ma, respectively (Charreau et al., <lb/>2005) (Fig. 8c). In the Chu basin in the northern Tianshan, the Sharpyldak formation, which is <lb/>analogous to the Xiyu Formation, was magnetostratigraphically dated at 3 Ma (Bullen et al., <lb/>2001). <lb/>This growing database shows that the deposition of the Xiyu Formation, and probably all <lb/>similar alluvial fan deposits around the Tianshan, is highly diachronous at both local and <lb/>regional scales. Fig. 9a shows the initial depositional age of the Xiyu conglomerates at <lb/>various locations around the Tianshan as a function of the present distance from the range <lb/>front. Because the range front topography is hard to define everywhere, the distance was <lb/>estimated using the location of the tectonic contact between the Paleozoic and Mesozoic units <lb/>as a reference. This plot shows a clear trend with decreasing ages from the mountain range <lb/>toward the basin (Fig. 9a). <lb/>All these observations suggest that the Xiyu conglomerates are a time-transgressive alluvial <lb/>gravel wedge unit that has prograded over the foreland as it was incorporated into the <lb/>orogenic wedge (Fig. 10). The diachronous character of the Xiyu Formation in the Kashi area <lb/>could reflect the effect of individual structures uplifting and causing reworking of sediments, <lb/>and hence facilitating its basinward progradation (Heermance et al., 2007). However, in <lb/>central Tianshan, no clear relationship exists between the depositional ages of the <lb/>conglomerates and the activation of individual structures. Moreover, the predominance of <lb/>clasts in the conglomerate that were derived from the high range suggests minor reworking of <lb/>sediments due to emerging structures in the piedmont. <lb/>While the conglomerates prograded over the foreland, deformation propagated toward the <lb/>basin as well ([Charreau et al., 2008a], [Daëron et al., 2007] and [Hubert-Ferrari et al., 2007]). <lb/>Therefore, the Xiyu Formation may unconformably overlie previously deformed units in <lb/>some places while in other places it lies conformably over underlying deposits, or exists as <lb/>syn-kinematic growth strata (Charreau et al., 2008a). Thus, the stratigraphic relationship <lb/>between the conglomerates and the underlying finer grained fluviatile units cannot be used as <lb/>a criterion to define the base of the Xiyu Formation. <lb/>7. Tectonic implications: a record of underthrusting rate? <lb/>
            The nature of the Xiyu Formation as a prograding gravel wedge can be used to make tectonic <lb/>inferences. First, the diachronism of the Xiyu conglomerates implies that they are not related <lb/>to any particular episode of thrusting and uplift in and around the Tianshan or the Tibetan <lb/>Plateau in the Plio-Pleistocene, as previously thought ([Burchfiel et al., 1999] and [Zheng et <lb/>al., 2000]). For example, Zheng et al. (2000) dated the base of the Xiyu conglomerates at <lb/>~ 3.5 Ma in the Yecheng section in the western Kunlun piedmont, and inferred that the <lb/>northern Tibetan plateau experienced rapid uplift at that time. This is likely incorrect, since <lb/>the Xiyu Formation is most probably also transgressive at front of the western Kunlun. This <lb/>particular depositional age of the conglomerates in Yecheng is probably only valid there and <lb/>has no particular significance at regional-scale. However, because of the time-transgressive <lb/>facies migration, the oldest settlement of this facies might be meaningful with regard to the <lb/>age of reactivation of the range (Brozovic and Burbank, 2000). The oldest Xiyu <lb/>conglomerates were dated at ~ 15.5 Ma in the Kashi piedmont (Heermance et al., 2007) <lb/>suggesting that at this time the topography of the range had been sufficiently rejuvenated for <lb/>erosion processes to lay down gravels along the piedmonts. This timing is consistent with the <lb/>observation that the sediment accumulation rate accelerated at about that time, as seen in <lb/>several sections around the range ([Charreau et al., 2009] and [Heermance et al., 2007]), and <lb/>with thermochronological studies which suggest that exhumation in the range started earlier, <lb/>possibly around ~ 25 Ma ([Dumitru et al., 2001], [Hendrix et al., 1994] and [Sobel et al., <lb/>2006]). <lb/>The plot in Fig. 9a shows a trend with the older Xiyu-type conglomerates lying closer to the <lb/>mountain front. As this plot disregards potential deformation of the foreland, the ~ 2 mm/yr <lb/>rate provides a minimum estimate of progradation of the conglomerates shed by the Tianshan <lb/>range. To better quantify the progradation history of the conglomerate wedge, the present <lb/>distances from the mountain front would need to be corrected for the amount of tectonic <lb/>transport that may have taken place at each location posterior to deposition (as illustrated in <lb/>the inset of Fig. 10). The distance of the transition from deposition of Xiyu-like <lb/>conglomerates to finer grained fluviatile sediments depends primarily on two factors: (1) the <lb/>transport capacity of the drainage system, and hence on topography and climate, and (2) the <lb/>rate at which the foreland is moving toward the mountain front (Simoes and Avouac, 2006). <lb/>So, the progradation rate within a particular section, V pr , measures the rate at which the study <lb/>area has moved toward the range due to underthrusting (V 1 in Fig. 10), added to a general <lb/>term that accounts for changes in topography and climate: <lb/>V pr =V 1 +f(topography,climate) <lb/>The total shortening rate across the range is the sum of all shortening across individual faults <lb/>(V i ) and would be the underthrusting rate V 1 plus the overthrusting rate (V 2 in Fig. 10; i.e., the <lb/>rate at which rocks within the range are advected with respect to the steady-state topography): <lb/>Both V 1 and V 2 have the same reference, which is the limit between the foreland and the basin <lb/>(Fig. 10), but V 1 is positive from the basin toward the range while V 2 is negative. When <lb/>erosion rates are low as in central Asia, V 2 represents only a small part of the thrusting rate <lb/>across the range and can be neglected (Avouac, 2003). With measured shortening rates across <lb/>individual faults, one can estimate V 1 and consequently constrain the influence of climate and <lb/>topography. Thanks to several recent studies, long-term shortening rates are known in both <lb/>Tianshan piedmonts. <lb/>Based on detailed constraints of the structure and age control, we restored the Yaha section. <lb/>This yields a horizontal minimum distance of ~ 4700 m between two points at the base of the <lb/>Xiyu from the north and south limbs of the fold (Fig. 4c), which leads to a progradation rate <lb/>of ~ 1.2 mm/yr. Over that same period, shortening across the Yakeng and Quilitage anticlines <lb/>(both located south of the Yaha section, Fig. 1) absorbed ~ 0.6 mm/yr and ~ 0.2 mm/yr from <lb/>~ 5.5 Ma to 0.2-0.3 Ma, respectively (Hubert-Ferrari et al., 2007). This adds ~ 0.8 mm/yr to <lb/>1.2 mm/yr, making it comparable to the progradation rate of 2.0 mm/yr. Hubert-Ferrari et al <lb/>(2007) also found evidence for an increase of shortening rate across the two anticlines by a <lb/>factor of 5 to 10 over the last 0.2-0.3 Myr. Yet, from the Quilitage anticline, the present <lb/>position of the Xiyu-like conglomerates is about ~ 20 km to the south, which implies a recent <lb/>and strong increase in progradation rate. This might indicate short timescale fluctuations of <lb/>shortening rates and/or climate that could not be identified by our analysis. <lb/>In the northern Tianshan, the basal age of Xiyu conglomerates has been dated at 2.5 Ma, <lb/>~ 4.8 Ma, and ~ 7.6 Ma along the Anjihai (Zhou et al., 2000), Kuitun (Charreau et al., 2005) <lb/>and Jingou He (Charreau et al., 2009) sections, respectively. It is possible to estimate the <lb/>paleodistances of these points with respect to a common reference line in the foreland (here <lb/>line that parallels the mean strike of piedmont&apos;s structures and fixed at latitude around <lb/>44°30′N, see Fig. 3b) to restore the sections. The current distances were corrected assuming <lb/>~ 1.2 km (Daëron et al., 2007) and ~ 4 km ([Avouac et al., 1993], [Burchfiel et al., 1999] and <lb/>[Molnar et al., 1994]) of shortening across the Dushanzi anticline along the Anjihai and <lb/>Kuitun sections, respectively, and ~ 10 km across the Huerguosi anticline (Charreau et al., <lb/>2008a). When plot on an age against distance diagram (Fig. 9b) those three restored <lb/>paleodistances align well with the distance of Holocene fans in the area (Fig. 9b). We thus <lb/>infer an average progradation rate of the Xiyu Formation over the Junggar basin of <lb/>~ 3.9 mm/yr over the last 10 Myr (Fig. 9b). As the Kuitun section does not lie directly <lb/>downstream of the JingouHe section, and because it is based on only four data points, this <lb/>estimate should be taken with caution. For comparison the shortening rate across the <lb/>Huerguosi and Anjihai anticlines (Fig. 1) is estimated at a minimum of ~ 1.5 mm/yr over the <lb/>last 4 Myr, and a minimum of ~ 1.1 mm/yr from 4 to ~ 10 Ma (Charreau et al., 2008a). <lb/>
            However, some fraction of the shortening across the piedmont is missing since it ignores <lb/>shortening across the Qigu anticline and across a fault-tip fold in the footwall of the <lb/>Huerguosi thrust fault (Charreau et al., 2008a). It seems therefore reasonable to assume that, <lb/>here too, the progradation rates of the Xiyu Formation is comparable to the shortening rates. <lb/>For comparison in the Kashi area, restoring distance from shortening, Heermance et al. (2007) <lb/>came to somewhat larger progradation rates of 10-11 mm/yr for the same time period. A <lb/>progradation rate larger in the Kashi area than in the Yaha section area is consistent with the <lb/>westward increase of the shortening rate across the range ([Avouac et al., 1993] and [Reigber <lb/>et al., 2001]). <lb/>These observations suggest that the progradation rate of the Xiyu Formation is primarily <lb/>controlled by tectonics reflecting the rate of underthrusting of the foreland beneath the <lb/>mountain front (Fig. 10). Note that, if so, the progradation rates observed north and south of <lb/>the range should not add to the total shortening rate across the range since ovethrusting rates <lb/>are not estimated and since there is also concomitant intermountain shortening, in particular <lb/>within the Bayanbulak basin (Fig. 1). In any case, this study shows that the underthrusting <lb/>rate at mountain fronts (the rate at which the basement of the foreland basin is thrust under the <lb/>range) might be inferred from sedimentary facies migration provided that the effects of <lb/>climate and eventual changes of the topography and sedimentary systems can be neglected or <lb/>known independently. <lb/>8. Climatic implications <lb/>(Zhang et al., 2001) and (Molnar, 2004) analysed the sedimentary archive of several large <lb/>basins around the world, including Junggar and Tarim. They observed a systematic and rapid <lb/>increase in sediment shed to the basins at ~ 4-2 Ma, around the Plio-Pleistocene transition. <lb/>They linked this increase to the onset of glaciation that may have enhanced erosion rates and <lb/>consequently impacted mountain building. In the case of central Asia, much of the data <lb/>supporting this hypothesis are derived from 1D local accumulation rates or from the work of <lb/>Métivier and Gaudemer (1997), who reconstructed regional sediment accumulation budgets <lb/>based on 1D drilling logs. However, Métivier and Gaudemer (1997) concluded that a gradual, <lb/>not sharp or punctual, increase in accumulation rates occurred since the early Miocene. <lb/>Moreover, their sediment flux estimates must be handled with caution as their reconstruction <lb/>is based on lithostratigraphic correlations that are probably biased by poorly constrained <lb/>depositional ages. The inference of an increase in the sediment flux (Métivier and Gaudemer, <lb/>1997) and local accumulation rates (Zhang et al., 2001) at 4-2 Ma is, for example, linked to <lb/>the strong assumption that the widespread Xiyu conglomerates were everywhere Plio-<lb/>Pleistocene in age, which, as shown above, is no longer valid. Moreover, some <lb/>magnetostratigraphic studies carried out around the Tianshan have revealed constant <lb/>accumulation rates for the last 10-11 Ma ([Charreau et al., 2009], [Charreau et al., 2005] and <lb/>[Charreau et al., 2006]). The same is true for the Neogene basins, of marginal seas along the <lb/>Himalayan range front, where no major timing-dependant increase of the sediment supply was <lb/>found in the depositional history (Clift, 2006) during this time period. <lb/>On the other hand, the estimates of (Clift, 2006) may not represent the total material eroded <lb/>from the Himalayas since a significant part of the sediments could have been trapped in the <lb/>Himalayan foreland (i.e. Siwaliks), and, more importantly, it ignores the Bay of Bengal. <lb/>
            Moreover, accumulation rates derived from magnetostratigraphic studies are often carried out <lb/>in syn-tectonic sediments across active folds, and must therefore be corrected for the effect of <lb/>fold growth (Charreau et al., 2008a). Finally, some studies show evidence for local increases <lb/>in accumulation rate during the Plio-Pleistocene. For example, magnetostratigraphy in the <lb/>JingouHe section suggest that the sedimentation rate in the piggyback basin increased <lb/>abruptly from ~ 0.4 to ~ 0.7 mm/yr at ca. 4 Ma (Charreau et al., 2008a). Magnetostratigraphic <lb/>dating of the Kashi town sections in the Kashi foreland, in the western Tarim basin, also <lb/>shows a significant accumulation rate acceleration ca. 4 Ma (Heermance et al., 2007). <lb/>However it might be questionable that the 1D accumulation profiles derived from the Jingou <lb/>He and Kashi sections can be extrapolated to sediment supply over the whole of central Asia <lb/>given the possible influence of local tectonic factors. Therefore, one can naturally conclude <lb/>that no strong evidence exists, yet, for a Quaternary sediment flux acceleration in the Tarim <lb/>and Junggar basins, or for a relationship between the Xiyu conglomerate and the onset of <lb/>Quaternary glaciation in central Asia. <lb/>9. Conclusions <lb/>The Xiyu Formation is a thick conglomeratic unit that has inspired various inferences with <lb/>regards to the timing of mountain building and the effect of climate change in central Asia. <lb/>The available data from magnetostratigraphic, sedimentological and structural studies of this <lb/>formation reveal that it constitutes a prograding gravel wedge with diachronous ages ranging <lb/>between ~ 15.5 and ~ 0.7 Ma. The Xiyu Formation cannot be considered as a <lb/>chronostratigraphic unit marker throughout the continental basins of central Asia. We suggest <lb/>that the progradation rate of the Xiyu Formation primarily reflects the rate at which the <lb/>foreland is thrust under the mountain range but that it must also reflect the evolution of <lb/>topography and climate. <lb/>Given the depositional diachronism of the Xiyu conglomerates, no evidence exists for a <lb/>regional accumulation rate acceleration at the Plio-Pleistocene transition to support the idea <lb/>that a change in regional climate occurred as reflected in the onset of Quaternary glaciation, <lb/>or of a sudden increase in topographic relief in central Asia. The impact of the Plio-<lb/>Pleistocene climatic transition on mountain building and mass transfer remains, therefore, an <lb/>open debate in central Asia. We suggest that the Tarim and Junggar intracontinental basins <lb/>may represent remarkable test cases to address this key issue in the future because sediment <lb/>flux could potentially be estimated in this closed system. In this regard, more chronological <lb/>data and good constraints on basin geometry are strongly needed to reconstruct accurate <lb/>sediment volumes. <lb/></body>
