			<front>COMMENTS AND <lb/>RESPONSES <lb/>Response to <lb/>Comment on: <lb/>Wheeler et al. <lb/>Macronutrients, Food <lb/>Groups, and Eating <lb/>Patterns in the <lb/>Management of <lb/>Diabetes: A <lb/>Systematic Review of <lb/>the Literature, 2010. <lb/>Diabetes Care <lb/>2012;35:434-445 <lb/></front>

            <body>W <lb/>e appreciate the comments from <lb/>Drs. Esposito and Giugliano (1) <lb/>concerning our systematic review <lb/>(2). Each issue will be addressed as out-<lb/>lined in their letter. <lb/>Wrong statement about results of <lb/>published articles (reference 104): We ac-<lb/>knowledge that the results were misquoted <lb/>in the systematic review and appreciate the <lb/>identification of the error. The correct data <lb/>have been substituted in the online version <lb/>of the article. <lb/>Reporting of one triplicate study (refer-<lb/>ences 105-107): The three publications <lb/>include different patients from the same <lb/>hospital, different meals consumed, and, to <lb/>some extent, different methodology used. <lb/>The authors (personal communication <lb/> with Smaragdi Antonopoulou, PhD on 22 <lb/>February 2012) have confirmed that the <lb/>publications are three separate studies. <lb/>Missing published studies: The two <lb/>other clinical trial references provided (3,4) <lb/>do meet the inclusion criteria for the sys-<lb/>tematic review and should have been in-<lb/>cluded in the review. However, because <lb/>both of these studies had a retention rate <lb/>of ,80%, according to our systematic re-<lb/>view procedure, they would not have been <lb/>included in the key summary for each topic <lb/>area. Further, the diet that significantly im-<lb/>proved A1C over the control diet in the <lb/>three-arm study by Elhayany et al. was a <lb/>combination of a Mediterranean diet <lb/>and a moderately low-carbohydrate diet <lb/>(35% carbohydrate, 45% fat); the traditional <lb/>Mediterranean diet (50-55% carbohydrate, <lb/>30% fat) did not demonstrate an advantage <lb/>for A1C over the control diet. <lb/>Two other studies provided-a cross-<lb/>sectional study (5) and a systematic re-<lb/>view (6)-also meet our inclusion criteria <lb/>and should have been included in the re-<lb/>view. However, neither would have affected <lb/>the summary statement. The cross-sectional <lb/>study would not have been included in the <lb/>summary as it did not compare the Medi-<lb/>terranean diet to any other type of eating <lb/>pattern, and the systematic review did not <lb/>add any additional studies that fit our in-<lb/>clusion criteria. <lb/>To clarify, our review does not sug-<lb/>gest that the Mediterranean diet should be <lb/>avoided in patients with diabetes; we <lb/>simply state that &quot;there appears to be no <lb/>advantage in using the Mediterranean-<lb/>style eating pattern compared with other <lb/>eating patterns for glycemic control.&quot; <lb/>From our review, we found that several <lb/>different eating patterns, including the <lb/>Mediterranean diet, show promise for <lb/>achieving glycemic control. There was, <lb/>however, not one particular eating pat-<lb/>tern with definitive evidence as being bet-<lb/>ter than the others. This leaves health care <lb/>providers the opportunity to work with <lb/>individuals to adopt eating patterns hon-<lb/>oring their own culture, food preferences, <lb/>and food availability while still achieving <lb/>glycemic control. <lb/></body>
