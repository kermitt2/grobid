U. Jung, J. Y. Kim, Jae-Hyuk Choi, and Sung-Ik Lee <lb/>National Creative Research Initiative Center for Superconductivity and Department of Physics, Pohang University of Science <lb/>and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Republic of Korea <lb/>(October 31, 2018) <lb/>The infinite-layer compound ACuO2 (A = alkaline-earth ions) is regarded as the most suitable <lb/>material for exploring the fundamental nature of the CuO2 plane because it does not contain a <lb/>charge-reservoir block, such as a rock-salt or a fluorite like block. We report that superconductivity <lb/>in the infinite-layer compound Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 is of a three-dimensional nature, in contrast to the <lb/>quasi two-dimensional superconducting behavior of all other cuprates. The key observation is that <lb/>the c-axis coherence length is longer than the c-axis lattice constant even at zero temperature. <lb/>This means that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO2 plane overlaps with those of <lb/>neighboring CuO2 planes all the temperatures below the Tc. Among all cuprates, only the infinite-<lb/>layer superconductor shows such a feature. <lb/></front>

			<body>The key ingredient of high-temperature superconduc-<lb/>tors (HTSC) is the CuO 2 plane in which superconduc-<lb/>tivity occurs. Besides the CuO plane, the unit cell of <lb/>HTSC generally contains a charge-reservoir block (CRB) <lb/>which supplies holes or electrons into the conducting <lb/>layer. However, the function of the CRB, beyond sup-<lb/>plying carriers in the materials, is not yet completely <lb/>clear. In one respect, the CRB might simply be a spacer <lb/>between the CuO 2 planes. In this case, the block reduces <lb/>the layer-by-layer coupling. The strong anisotropic na-<lb/>ture of HTSC is believed to be a reflection of this weak <lb/>interlayer coupling. In this context, the infinite-layer <lb/>compounds ACuO 2 (A = alkaline-earth ions) are remark-<lb/>able, because they do not have a CRB, so the simplicity <lb/>of their crystal structure may allow in-depth insight into <lb/>the basic mechanism of cuprate superconductivity. Due <lb/>to the absence of the CRB, infinite-layer compounds have <lb/>two notable features. First, the distance from one unit <lb/>cell to the next is the shortest among all the cuprates. <lb/>[1] Secondly, as a matter of course, charge carriers can <lb/>be supplied only from the cations at the A sites. For <lb/>example, the carrier density of the stoichometric infinite-<lb/>layer SrCuO is zero. The partial substitution of La +3 <lb/>(or Nd +3 ) for Sr +2 results in superconductivity in these <lb/>compounds. [2] In this case, the carriers are not holes, <lb/>but electrons. [3-6] <lb/>Recently, we successfully synthesized pure-phase <lb/>Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 (Sr(La)-112) with T c ≃ K by using a <lb/>cubic multi-anvil press. The details of the sample prepa-<lb/>ration will be given elsewhere. [7] In this work, we mea-<lb/>sured the reversible magnetization as a function of the <lb/>temperature and the angle between the c axis and the <lb/>applied magnetic field. From analysis of the data, we <lb/>found that the usual HTSC two-dimensional (2D) tem-<lb/>perature region of ξ c (T ) &lt; c below T c did not exist in this <lb/>compound. This peculiar feature has not been observed <lb/>in any other high-T c material. Until now, YBa Cu 3 O 7−δ <lb/>(Y-123) has been known to have the most strong inter-<lb/>layer coupling, but the three-dimensional (3D) tempera-<lb/>ture region is limited to near T c only. Previously, [8] it <lb/>was claimed that the high-T c superconductivity occurred <lb/>only on the 2D network of CuO planes, since a 3D net-<lb/>work did not permit spin or charge fluctuation while a <lb/>1D structure did not establish long range order of super-<lb/>conductivity. Hence, our observation of 3D superconduc-<lb/>tivity in entire region below T c in Sr(La)-112 provides a <lb/>new aspect of high-temperature superconductivity. <lb/>For the magnetization measurements, we aligned the <lb/>grains of the sample in commercial epoxy under an ex-<lb/>ternal magnetic field of 11 T. [9-13] Fig. 1 displays the <lb/>x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern of Sr(La)-112 be-<lb/>fore and after the grain alignment. After the alignment, <lb/>only the (002) reflection was seen in the XRD pattern. <lb/>The inset of Fig. 1 shows the x-ray rocking curve of the <lb/>(002) reflection. The full width at half maximum of the <lb/>reflection is less than 1 degree, which means a good c-<lb/>axis alignment. The aligned sample was approximately <lb/>9.5 mm in length and 3 mm in diameter. The reversible <lb/>magnetization was measured as a function of the temper-<lb/>ature and the angle between the c axis and the applied <lb/>magnetic field by using a superconducting quantum in-<lb/>terference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS-XL, <lb/>Quantum design). <lb/>Figure 2 shows the reversible magnetization, 4πM (T ), <lb/>at fields of 1 T ≤ H ≤ 5 T parallel to the c axis of the <lb/>sample. In this figure, the symbols and the lines denote <lb/>the zero-field-cooled and the field-cooled magnetizations, <lb/>respectively. In comparison with other cuprates, our data <lb/>show two interesting features. First, the curves shift to <lb/>lower temperature as the field increases and are almost <lb/>parallel to each other. This typical mean-field behavior <lb/>is consistent with the prediction of the Abrikosov model <lb/>

            [14] in which the magnetization scales linearly with the <lb/>magnetic field. Such a feature has never been observed <lb/>before for any high-T c cuprate because the mean-field <lb/>behavior is usually screened by strong thermal fluctua-<lb/>tions. [15] Secondly, the rate of decrease of T c (H) with <lb/>respect to the field is significantly larger than that of <lb/>other cuprates, here the superconducting transition tem-<lb/>perature, T c (H), is estimated as the temperature at the <lb/>point of intersection of a linear extrapolation of 4πM (T ) <lb/>in the superconducting state with the normal-state base <lb/>line of 4πM = 0. For instance, at H = 5 T, T c (H) is <lb/>found to be about 33 K, which corresponds to 0.77T c (0). <lb/>Hence, the upper-critical field H c2 (0) is expected to be <lb/>about 20 T, assuming a linear T c (H). To determine <lb/>H c2 (0) precisely, we apply the Hao-Clem model for re-<lb/>versible magnetization [16,17] to our data. The details <lb/>of the analysis will be given elsewhere (M.-S. Kim et al., <lb/>manuscript in preparation). Two important parameters <lb/>characterizing the compound are the Ginzburg-Landau <lb/>parameter, κ, and the slope of the upper-critical field <lb/>near T c , dH c2 /dT | Tc . The Hao-Clem model analysis <lb/>gives κ = 25.3 ± 1.1 and dH c2 /dT | Tc = −0.47 ± 0.02 <lb/>T/K. Using these, we estimate H c2 (0) to be 13.9 ± 0.5 <lb/>T through the relationship H c2 (0) ≃ 0.7(dH c2 /dT ) Tc T c , <lb/>[18] which is about ten times smaller than the value <lb/>for other cuprate superconductors. The in-plane coher-<lb/>ence length ξ ab (0) = [φ 0 /2πH c2 (0)] 1/2 is calculated to be <lb/>48.6 ± 1.0Å, where φ 0 is the flux quantum. [19] <lb/>In our study, we apply the Hao-Clem model to de-<lb/>scribe our magnetization data. [10-12] Since the model <lb/>is derived from the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau <lb/>(GL) theory, our result is justified in the GL framework. <lb/>However, we judge our result not to be model depen-<lb/>dent particularly from the following consideration: The <lb/>open symbols in the inset of Fig. 2 represent the in-plane <lb/>magnetic penetration depth, λ ab (T ), obtained from the <lb/>dc-magnetic susceptibility, 4πχ(T ), for the low-field re-<lb/>gion of H &lt; H c1 . To deduce λ ab (T ) from the 4πχ(T ) <lb/>curve, we use the Shoenberg formula, [20] which is not <lb/>model dependent, but is merely based on the London <lb/>equations. For comparison, we also plot λ ab (T ) (filled <lb/>symbols) from the Hao-Clem analysis in the same figure. <lb/>We can see that the two curves, indeed, coincide. Thus, <lb/>we can conclude that the application of the Hao-Clem <lb/>model in this study does not reduce the generality of our <lb/>results. <lb/>In the inset of Fig. 2, the solid line represents the tem-<lb/>perature dependence of the penetration depth assuming <lb/>the BCS clean limit. [14] The estimated zero-temperature <lb/>penetration depth, λ ab (0), is 147 ± 6 nm, which is close <lb/>to λ ab (0) ≃ 130 nm of Y-123. In the framework of the <lb/>London model, the penetration depth is proportional to <lb/>(m * <lb/>ab /n s ) 1/2 , where m * and n s are the electronic effective <lb/>mass in the ab plane and the charge-carrier density, re-<lb/>spectively. According to the empirical Uemura relation, <lb/>[21] i.e., T c ∼ n s /m * <lb/>ab , the T c &apos;s of the two compounds <lb/>should be nearly the same. However, the T c of Sr(La)-<lb/>112 is about half that of Y-123. This discordance might <lb/>differentiate Sr(La)-112 from the hole-doped cuprates. <lb/>For the cuprate superconductors studied until now, <lb/>the zero-temperature coherence length along the c axis, <lb/>ξ c (0), was found to be much smaller than the unit c-<lb/>axis length. As the temperature increased toward T c , <lb/>a dimensional crossover from 2D to 3D occurred at a <lb/>certain temperature T * where ξ c (T * ) = c/ <lb/>√ <lb/>2. [22] For <lb/>moderately anisotropic materials like Y-123, a broader <lb/>3D-temperature region around T c was observed due to <lb/>strong interlayer coupling. [23] However, the 3D region <lb/>for strongly anisotropic compounds, such as Bi-and Tl-<lb/>based superconductors, was found to be extremely nar-<lb/>row. [24] <lb/>Since the unit structure of an infinite-layer supercon-<lb/>ductor does not contain a CRB, one can expect the cou-<lb/>pling between CuO planes to be strong. [25] To date, <lb/>however, no rigorous studies to examine the dimension-<lb/>ality of the compound have been done. With our high-<lb/>quality samples, we designed experiments to obtain the <lb/>anisotropy ratio γ = ξ ab /ξ c . A combination of γ and the <lb/>ξ ab (0) obtained above gives the ratio ξ c /c which deter-<lb/>mines the dimensionality of the system. <lb/>Under an external magnetic field, the magnetization <lb/>of all anisotropic materials has two components, M L and <lb/>M T . M L is the component parallel to the field, and the <lb/>other component, M T , is perpendicular to the field. Usu-<lb/>ally, M T can be measured using a torque magnetometer, <lb/>and the degree of anisotropy is reflected in the angu-<lb/>lar dependence of the torque, τ (θ) = HM T (θ). Previ-<lb/>ously, Farrell et al. [26,27] measured the magnetic torque <lb/>curves for highly anisotropic Bi Sr 2 CaCu 2 O 8 (Bi-2212) <lb/>and moderately anisotropic Y-123. By applying the Lon-<lb/>don model to the data, they obtained the anisotropy ra-<lb/>tios γ ≃ 55 and γ ≃ 5 for Bi-2212 and Y-123, respectively. <lb/>On the other hand, we obtained the anisotropy ratio of <lb/>Sr(La)-112 by measuring M L (θ) using a SQUID magne-<lb/>tometer with a sample rotator. The obtained data were <lb/>analyzed by using the calculation of Hao et al. [16,17] <lb/>which considered the effective mass anisotropy of the ma-<lb/>terial. For comparison, we also applied the London model <lb/>[14] to the data. <lb/>Figure 3 shows the angular dependence of the re-<lb/>versible magnetization, 4πM (θ), measured at H = 1 T <lb/>in the temperature range of 36.5 K ≤ T ≤ 40 K. [28] <lb/>In this figure, the solid lines represent the theoretical <lb/>prediction of the Hao-Clem model. We see a good fit, <lb/>except for temperatures above T = 39 K. We infer that <lb/>the departure of the data from the theoretical lines at <lb/>higher temperatures is due to the thermal fluctuation <lb/>effect, which becomes more important as the tempera-<lb/>ture increases. [10,13] The inset of Fig. 3 is a plot of the <lb/>anisotropy ratio obtained from each curve in Fig. 3. The <lb/>filled and the open symbols are deduced by application of <lb/>the Hao-Clem and the London models, respectively. In <lb/>

            the filled-symbol set, the curve shows a plateau behav-<lb/>ior at low temperatures and then increases monotonically <lb/>with temperature. The increase is postulated to originate <lb/>from the thermal fluctuation effect, as mentioned above. <lb/>In the open-symbol set, however, no such plateau feature <lb/>exists. In fact, the London model is known to be suitable <lb/>for the low-field region of H ≪ H c2 . Since our magneti-<lb/>zation data were taken near the transition temperature, <lb/>the external field of 1 T is regarded as considerably large. <lb/>Thus, our data set is out of the London region. This is <lb/>consistent with the 4πM (T ) data in Fig. 2, which lie in <lb/>the Abrikosov region. <lb/>It is quite natural to take the value of the plateau in the <lb/>filled-symbol set as the real anisotropy ratio. With this <lb/>value, γ = 9.3 ± 0.2, we obtain an out-of-plane coherence <lb/>length of ξ c (0) = 5.2 ± 0.3Å by using the relationship <lb/>ξ c = ξ ab /γ and the value of ξ ab (0) from the above anal-<lb/>ysis. The criterion for 3D superconductivity below T c is <lb/>ξ c (T ) &gt; c/ <lb/>√ <lb/>2. [22] The value of ξ ab (0) = 5.4Å is con-<lb/>siderably larger than the c/ <lb/>√ <lb/>2 ≃ 2.4Å. This means that <lb/>the superconducting order parameter of one CuO plane <lb/>overlaps with those of neighboring CuO planes even at <lb/>zero temperature. <lb/>Additional evidence for 3D superconductivity can be <lb/>found from the scaling analysis [10-13,24,29,30] of the <lb/>fluctuation-induced magnetization for the high-field re-<lb/>gion. According to Ullah and Dorsey, [31] the magnetiza-<lb/>tion in the critical region scales with the scaling variable <lb/>of A[T − T c (H)]/(T H) n , where A is a field and transi-<lb/>tion temperature-independent coefficient, and n is 2/3 <lb/>for a 3D system and 1/2 for a 2D system. As expected, <lb/>the magnetization scales excellently with the 3D form. <lb/>Figure 4 shows 4πM/(T H) n versus the scaling param-<lb/>eter (T − T c (H))/(T H) n with n = 2/3. All the data <lb/>for the different fields collapse onto a single curve. The <lb/>slope −dH c2 /dT ≃ 0.5 T/K near T c is obtained from this <lb/>scaling analysis. This value is fairly consistent with that <lb/>deduced from the c-axis magnetization analysis. <lb/>Our results provide clear evidences for three-<lb/>dimensional superconductivity, even at zero temperature, <lb/>in the infinite-layer compound Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 . Here, we <lb/>deduced the anisotropy ratio γ to be about 9 by mea-<lb/>suring the angular dependence of the reversible magne-<lb/>tization. This value is somewhat larger than the value <lb/>of γ ≃ 5 for Y-123. However, the absence of a CRB in <lb/>the infinite-layer compound allows the order parameter <lb/>of one layer to overlap with those of neighboring layers. <lb/>In addition, we found that the empirical Uemura relation <lb/>was not applicable to the case of Sr 0.9 La 0.1 CuO 2 . <lb/></body>
