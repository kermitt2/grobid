Cranial vaginal swabs and uterine biopsy samples were collected from twenty-<lb/>five bitches in five different stages of estrous at elective ovariohysterectomy (OVH). Over 4 <lb/>million reads of the V4 region of 16S rDNA gene were obtained and used for further analy-<lb/>ses. A total of 317 genera belonging to 24 known phyla were identified. The endometrium <lb/>was higher in bacterial diversity while the vagina was higher in richness. Proteobacteria, <lb/>Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla observed across all samples. <lb/>Hydrotalea, Ralstonia, and Fusobacterium accounted for nearly 60% of the OTUs identified <lb/>in the vagina while organisms identified in the endometrium were more evenly distributed. <lb/>Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium were the prominent genera in the <lb/>endometrium. The microbiome of the endometrium was distinctly different from that of the <lb/>vagina. There was large animal-to-animal variation. Other than the vaginal microbiome of <lb/>bitches in estrus (i.e. in heat), there were no distinct clustering of the organisms based on <lb/>the stage of estrous. These findings establish the presence of a resident microbiome of the <lb/>endometrium throughout all stages of estrous cycle. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>While it is established that the cranial vagina of mammals harbor a thriving microbial ecosys-<lb/>tem, the uterus was long considered a sterile environment in order to sustain a successful preg-<lb/>nancy. This paradigm was recently challenged by the observation that the human placenta <lb/>harbors a diverse microbiome [1, 2]. There is little information available on canine reproduc-<lb/>tive tract microbiota and all available data has been obtained using culture-based techniques <lb/>[3-7]. It has been established that standard culture-based techniques fail to detect &gt;90% of res-<lb/>ident microflora [8], underestimate diversity [9], and overestimate the role of culturable bacte-<lb/>ria [10]. <lb/></body>

			<body>A recent study utilizing culture-independent 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence analysis <lb/>of the bovine and ovine vaginal microbiota from ectocervicovaginal lavages revealed that cow <lb/>and ewe vaginal microbiota are unique from previously described vaginal microbial ecosys-<lb/>tems [11]. Similarly other studies specifically investigating the bovine uterine bacterial micro-<lb/>biota in healthy and metritic postpartum dairy cows found a significant diversity in the <lb/>type and succession of bacterial communities related to clinical signs and in time progression <lb/>[12-15]. <lb/>Although the presence of commensal microorganisms in the uterine lumen is generally <lb/>accepted in human medicine [2, 16, 17], the general consensus in canine medicine still is that <lb/>the normal uterus is a sterile environment [18]. Many microbes are implicated in infertility <lb/>and pregnancy loss [19, 20]. Culture of uterine swabs are performed routinely in bitches that <lb/>fail to get pregnant with normal breed/cycle management and presence of any growth calls for <lb/>antibiotic intervention [21]. As far as we are aware, this is the first comprehensive study of <lb/>uterine and vaginal microbiota of normal, healthy bitches using a culture-independent tech-<lb/>nique. We provide essential and compelling evidence, that the canine uterus has a thriving <lb/>microbial ecosystem and that treating a breeding bitch with antibiotics in the absence of <lb/>abnormal diagnostic findings is counterproductive. <lb/>Here we describe a culture-independent approach to evaluate bacterial population structure <lb/>and diversity of the cranial vagina and the endometrium of 25 clinically healthy bitches at vari-<lb/>ous stages of estrous. We present a comparative analysis of the microbiomes of the vagina and <lb/>the endometrium, organisms identified in both environments at both phylum and genus lev-<lb/>els, and differences observed at different stages of estrous. <lb/>Material and methods <lb/>Animals <lb/>Fifty young, healthy bitches presented to Oklahoma State University, Boren Veterinary Medi-<lb/>cal Hospital for elective ovariohysterectomy (OVH) were utilized in sample collection. Dogs <lb/>with clinical signs of estrus (i.e. in heat) were noted. None of the animals had recent antibiotic <lb/>exposure. Bitches were induced and anesthetized using an accepted shelter protocol: Telazol-<lb/>Torbugesic-Dexdomitor (Pfizer Animal Health, Parsippany, NJ) [22]. Once a level surgical <lb/>plane of anesthesia was obtained, each patient had blood samples collected for hormonal <lb/>assays. Samples for vaginal culture and cytology were collected using a standard technique <lb/>[21]. Briefly, after placing a sterile otoscope cone beyond the vaginal vestibule, a sterile cultur-<lb/>ette swab (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was passed through the speculum to contact <lb/>the anterior vagina. The swab was placed inside of a sterile Eppendorf tube or sterile cryovial <lb/>tube for transport to the lab. Vaginal epithelial cell samples were obtained by passing a vaginal <lb/>cytologic brush through a vaginal speculum. A vaginal smear was prepared immediately and <lb/>processed in Diff-Quick stain (Cole-Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL). The slides were evaluated to <lb/>assist in classification of stages of estrous. Patients were then moved to the surgical suite for <lb/>ovariohysterectomy. The reproductive tract was removed using sterile surgical technique. The <lb/>uterine body was clamped and ligated proximal to the cervix. Two sections of uterine endome-<lb/>trial samples (1cm X1cm) were obtained using sterile Metzenbaum scissors and stored in indi-<lb/>vidual sterile Eppendorf tubes or sterile cryovial tubes appropriate for liquid nitrogen <lb/>cryopreservation of the endometrium until DNA extraction. Blood samples were evaluated <lb/>using ELISA progesterone assay. Animal use and procedures were approved by the Oklahoma <lb/>State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC VM-14-42). All ani-<lb/>mals used in this study belonged to the Humane Society of Stillwater and were undergoing <lb/>mandatory ovariohysterectomy prior to being offered for adoption.

			<body>Humane Society approved of the collection of samples for the research described in this <lb/>manuscript. <lb/>Estrous cycle based group designation <lb/>Of the fifty animals that were utilized in sample collection, five animals whose samples clearly <lb/>demarcated the stage of cycle were assigned to one of five groups based on the stage of the <lb/>estrous cycle: pre-pubertal, anestrus, pro-estrus, estrus or diestrus (n = 5 per group) giving a <lb/>total of twenty-five animals. Staging of the cycle was accomplished retrospectively via serum <lb/>progesterone analysis and by interpretation of vaginal cytology (superficial cornification, or <lb/>lack thereof) obtained immediately prior to the time of surgery, after which the samples were <lb/>allocated to their respective groups. Pre-pubertal group was determined by age. <lb/>DNA Isolation <lb/>Paired vaginal swab and endometrial biopsy samples from each animal were obtained for <lb/>DNA extraction. 0.4g of tissue was ground up in liquid N 2 and total DNA was extracted from <lb/>individual samples using QiAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and following <lb/>manufacturer&apos;s instructions. A 0.8% (wt/vol) low melting point agarose gel was used to mea-<lb/>sure DNA quality. DNA was purified by using the Agarose Gel DNA Purification Kit (TaKaRa <lb/>Bio USA Inc., Mountainview, CA, USA). Purified DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop <lb/>ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). We obtained <lb/>161-605 ng/μl DNA from endometrial biopsies and 58-128 ng/μl DNA from vaginal swabs. <lb/>Each batch of DNA extractions and each new QiAamp DNA mini kit used were accompanied <lb/>by a negative control consisting of H 2 O roughly at the same volume as the samples analyzed. <lb/>Negative controls yielded 2-10 ng/μl DNA which was around the published minimal detection <lb/>level of the NanoDrop instrument that was used for quantifying DNA. All DNA extractions <lb/>were subjected to PCR amplification using 515F and 806R primer pair described below. All <lb/>biopsy and swabs samples showed robust amplification of microbial DNA while the negative <lb/>controls did not have a visible band after 35 cycles of amplification. Samples were stored at <lb/>-20˚C. Frozen DNA samples were sent to Molecular Research LLC for sequence analysis. Neg-<lb/>ative controls were not sequence analyzed as their concentration and quality was far below the <lb/>threshold acceptable to the sequence provider. <lb/>PCR amplification and DNA sequencing <lb/>A ~250 bp fragment from ribosomal v4 region was PCR-amplified from resulting DNA. PCR <lb/>amplification and amplicon sequencing was performed by Molecular Research LLC (Mr. <lb/>DNA), Shallowater, TX using their established protocols [23]. Briefly, an aliquot of 50 ng DNA <lb/>was used as template for PCR amplification. The V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified <lb/>using the primer pair 515F (5&apos;-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3&apos;) and 806R (5&apos;-GGAC <lb/>TACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3&apos;) with added barcodes on the forward primer. DNA was amplified <lb/>in a 28-cycle PCR using HotStarTaqPlus Master Mix Kit (Qiagen, USA) under the following <lb/>conditions: 94˚C for 3 minutes, followed by 28 cycles of 94˚C for 30 seconds, 53˚C for 40 sec-<lb/>onds, and 72˚C for 1 minute. Afterward, a final elongation step of 72˚C for 5 minutes was <lb/>performed. <lb/>A 2% agarose gel was used to determine the success of PCR amplification. DNA was puri-<lb/>fied using Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA). Multiple barcoded samples were pooled <lb/>in equal proportions based on their molecular weight and DNA concentrations. Pooled sam-<lb/>ples were purified with calibrated Ampure XP beads. The resulting pooled and purified PCR <lb/>product was used to prepare Illumina sequencing library. The library was constructed using <lb/></body>

			<body>TruSeq DNA PCR-free sample preparation kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) following <lb/>instructions and index codes were added. The library was quality tested on a Qubit 3.0 fluo-<lb/>rometer (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) and an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent <lb/>Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The library was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 platform <lb/>(Illumina) and 250bp paired-end raw reads were generated. <lb/>Bioinformatic analysis <lb/>Mothur 1.37 was used for data mining following the MiSeq standard operating procedure <lb/>(SOP) [24]. Briefly, paired-end reads were assembled and assigned to each sample based on <lb/>their unique barcode and then truncated by removing barcodes and primer sequences. <lb/>Sequence reads that were over 273 bp in length, those that contained homoploymeric tracts of <lb/>longer than 8 bp in length, those that had more than one mismatch against primer sequences, <lb/>contained undetermined bases, ambiguities, or did not align to V4 hypervariable region were <lb/>removed from the analysis. Qualified contigs were further processed with commands &apos;trim. <lb/>seqs&apos; and &apos;pre.cluster&apos;. Uchime was used to remove chimeric sequences [25]. Alignment of V4 <lb/>region against SILVA rRNA ref nr123 [26] was performed using mothur (Needleman-Wunsch <lb/>algorithm). Qualified sequences were classified into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) <lb/>based on at least 97% similarity (OTU 0.03 ). All sequences of OTU 0.03 were assigned into taxo-<lb/>nomic groups at the bootstrap threshold of 80%. Samples were randomly normalized to the <lb/>sample with the least amount of sequencing reads to avoid sequencing bias. Alpha diversity <lb/>was calculated using command &apos;summary.single&apos; in mothur. Beta diversity was measured <lb/>using Unifrac-based metrics generated with command &apos;unifrac.weighted&apos; [27]. Raw sequenc-<lb/>ing data was submitted to Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at NCBI (access number SRP <lb/>115220). <lb/>Statistical analyses <lb/>R 3.3.2 statistical analysis software [28] was used to perform one-way analyses of variance <lb/>(one-way ANOVA), t-test, and Tukey&apos;s honest significant difference (HSD) test. Differences <lb/>were labeled as significant when the P value was &lt;0.05. The unweighted pair group method <lb/>with arithmetic mean(UPGMA) algorithm was performed using phangorn package in R [29]. <lb/>The UPGMA tree was used to reveal the similarity of bacterial community composition. <lb/>Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Effect Size (LEfSe) was used to determine the change in <lb/>relative abundance of the bacterial community [30]. The non-parametric factorial Kruksal-<lb/>Wallis (KW) sum-rank test was first used to determine taxa with significant abundant differ-<lb/>ences (P&lt;0.05). The unpaired Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the significant <lb/>abundant differences among taxa (P&lt;0.05). Linear Discriminant Analysis was applied to cal-<lb/>culate effective size of abundant differences. Neighbor-joining trees were generated using <lb/>MEGAN Community Edition [31]. The Shannon diversity index was calculated using mothur <lb/>and principal coordinate analyses (PCoA) was calculated based on the distance matrix. <lb/>Results <lb/>16S rDNA sequencing resulted in 4,134,024 paired-end reads. After removal of ambiguous <lb/>and low-quality reads, 3,527,169 reads remained resulting in 70,543±51,247 reads per sample. <lb/>A taxonomy rarefaction curve (data not shown) indicated that the utilized sequencing depth <lb/>was sufficient to saturate the bacterial diversity in canine endometrium and vagina. Next-gen-<lb/>eration sequencing with barcoded and pooled amplicons generates large variations in reads <lb/>among samples. To eliminate sample size bias in downstream comparative analyses, we sub-<lb/>sampled every animal/tissue to normalize the reads to that with the lowest number of reads <lb/></body>

			<body>[24, 32, 33]. After this process, 572,100 reads were selected for OTU classification. Of these, <lb/>562,971 reads were assigned to 24 known phyla and 384,974 sequence reads were classified <lb/>into 317 known genera. Phylum Proteobacteria had the highest diversity with 120 OTUs, fol-<lb/>lowed by Firmicutes (74 OTUs), Actinobacteria (46 OTUs), Bacteroidetes (38 OTUs), and <lb/>Fusobacteria (5 OTUs). Proteobacteria was also the most abundant phylum at 24.23% followed <lb/>by Bacteroidetes (17.32%), Firmicutes (14.4%), Actinobacteria (8.06%) Tenericutes (6.22%) <lb/>and Fusobacteria (3.27%). Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes, the three dominant <lb/>phyla, accounted for 55.99% of the total bacterial community. Only three phyla, Proteobac-<lb/>teria, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria, were found in all 50 samples while Actinobacteria, Fir-<lb/>micutes and Tenericutes were observed in at least 47 samples. Bacteroidetes (34.3%), <lb/>Proteobacteria (26.2%), Tenericutes (15%), and Firmicutes (12.9%) were the most prevalent <lb/>phyla in the vagina while Proteobacteria (38.8%), Firmicutes (26.2%), Actinobacteria (18.2%), <lb/>and Bacteroidetes (9.4%) were the most prevalent phyla in the uterus (Fig 1, Table 1). Of the <lb/>24 phyla identified in this study, Cyanobacteria, Elusimicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes, Lenti-<lb/>sphaerae, and Thermotogae were only found in the vagina while Armatimonadetes, Chlamyd-<lb/>iae, and Deferribacteres, were only identified in the uterus. Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-<lb/>Thermus, Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, and Verrucomicrobia were extremely <lb/>rare in the vagina (&lt;5%). Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in vagina compared to the <lb/>uterus (0.38 and 1.61 respectively). <lb/>At genus level (Fig 2 and S1 Table), 317 genera were identified in the endometrium and <lb/>vagina (248 in the endometrium and 254 in the vagina); Hydrotalea, Ralstonia, and Myco-<lb/>plasma accounted for 59.4% of the organisms identified in the vagina while the endometrium <lb/>had a more evenly distributed microbiome. Microbiome of the endometrium was also more <lb/>diverse than that of the vagina.

Although the presence of a placental microbiome has been ques-<lb/>tioned recently due to the possibility of contamination [46, 47], the presence of a rich micro-<lb/>biome in the mammalian endometrium was established in several species [48-51]. A few <lb/>studies have been performed exploring the microbiome of the canine reproductive tract [3, 6, <lb/>52-56], however these were all performed based on culture-based techniques that fail to iden-<lb/>tify a majority of organisms that inhabit a given ecosystem. <lb/>In this study, we sought to establish the vaginal and endometrial microbiomes of healthy <lb/>bitches. Samples were collected from 50 bitches and the stage of estrous cycle was determined <lb/>by serum progesterone analysis and vaginal cytology. Five animals were picked from each of <lb/>the five stages of estrous for sequence analysis. All animals used in this study were stray or <lb/>abandoned animals presented to a local animal shelter and, as such, we had no information on <lb/>their exact age or breed. Most animals looked cross-bred. Although estimated age and the <lb/>most probable breed composition of the animal was recorded, we did not select animals based <lb/>on those two criteria. We were able to amplify 16S rDNA fragments from each sample. How-<lb/>ever, our methodology does not allow us to estimate the total amount of rDNA fragments <lb/>amplified from each sample and as such, we cannot infer the density of microorganisms in any <lb/>one of the samples. We found the vagina to be much higher in richness (number of different <lb/>species) but lower in diversity (number of species and abundance of each species) compared to <lb/>Fig 6.

			<body>the endometrium (Table 2). The lower diversity is because 59.4% of the OTUs identified in the <lb/>vagina belonged to three genera, Ralstonia, Hydrotalea, and Mycoplasma (S1 Table). The <lb/>vagina at estrus (i.e. in heat) was the most diverse as well as the highest in richness (Table 3). <lb/>The differences however were not statistically significant except between estrus and pre-puber-<lb/>tal stage (Fig 3). The lack of significant differences among vaginal microbiomes at main stages <lb/>of estrous cycle is consistent with that seen in Go ¨ttingen minipigs [57]. Organisms identified <lb/>as major occupants of the vaginal microbiome in this study are different from other published <lb/>studies on canine vaginal microbiome. The most commonly isolated organisms in studies that <lb/>are older than 10 years include; Escherichia coli, Streptococcus canis, Pasteurella multocida, <lb/>Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius [3, 4, 58]. Of more recent studies, <lb/>Maksimovic&apos; et al. [6] found Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Escherichia coli, and Proteus <lb/>spp. to be the most prevalent species and Hutchins et al. [7] found Staphylococcus pseudinter-<lb/>medius, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli to be the most prevalent species. <lb/>Although we detected 9184 OTUs of Streptococcus spp they only represented 4.4% of the popu-<lb/>lation (S1 Table). Staphylococcus represented 1.5% of the population, Enterococcus represented <lb/>.006% of the population, and we only detected Proteus in the endometrium. Surprisingly, we <lb/>did not detect any members of the genus Escherichia in our study. As noted before, all previous <lb/>studies have been conducted using culture-based technologies making a direct comparison dif-<lb/>ficult. Culture-based technologies are biased towards organisms that grow well in culture <lb/>media, aerobic organisms, and those that have a faster growth time. Lactobacilli is the most <lb/>common organism identified in humans ranging from 70-100% of human vaginal microbiota <lb/>[59-61]. We observed 76 OTUs representing Lactobacillus spp in the vagina and 25 OTUs in <lb/>the endometrium. Lactobacilli in the canine vagina represented 0.03% of the population. The <lb/>low abundance of Lactobacilli is consistent with what is observed in the cow and ewe repro-<lb/>ductive tracts [11] and could be attributable to the near neutral to alkaline pH [62] of the <lb/>canine vagina. Hydrotalea was the most prevalent genus in the vagina and accounted for over <lb/>25% of the organisms identified in the canine vagina. Hydrotalea belong to the family Bacteroi-<lb/>detes and is generally known as an aquatic species [63]. To our knowledge, other than low-<lb/>level presence in a single study on antibiotic-induced changes in rat gut [64], Hydrotalea has <lb/>never been reported in microbiomes of land-dwelling animals. Ralstonia accounted for 20.8% <lb/>of organisms detected in the vagina. Ralstonia belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and is not <lb/>commonly associated with animals and no members of the genus is known to be pathogenic. <lb/>It has never been reported in a healthy mammalian vagina although it has been reported in <lb/>low concentrations in women that had levonorgestrel containing intrauterine devices placed <lb/>in them (0.8% in vagina, 7.8% in uterus) [65] and in one study of women diagnosed with clini-<lb/>cal vaginosis (0.8%) [66]. Mycoplasma (13.2%) was the third most abundant species. Although <lb/>Mycoplasma was present in all 25 samples we tested, it is not considered a major organism in <lb/>normal, healthy, vaginal flora of humans or animals [67]. However, it has been reported in <lb/>bacterial vaginosis and other disease statuses in humans for decades [66, 68]. Watts et al., failed <lb/>to culture mycoplasma from the reproductive tract of bitches at different stages of reproductive <lb/>cycle [56], while it was isolated from bitches treated with ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfa-<lb/>methoxazole [69]. We found high numbers of Mycoplasma ubiquitously present in all the sam-<lb/>ples we tested from the vagina and they were detected at much lower concentration (0.18%) in <lb/>the endometrium suggesting that it is a commensal organism in the healthy canine reproduc-<lb/>tive tract. <lb/>In contrast to the vagina, we found the microbiome of the endometrium more evenly dis-<lb/>tributed. Although the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes <lb/>accounted for 92.6% of the 19 phyla identified in the endometrium (Table 1, Fig 1), the distri-<lb/>bution of the organisms at genus level was more even (S1 Table, Fig 2). Pseudomonas (9.9%), <lb/></body>

			<body>Staphylococcus (6.5%) and Campylobacter (5.8%) were the most prevalent genera. Unlike in <lb/>the vagina, no organism represented more than 10% of the population. This distribution is in <lb/>stark contrast to endometrial microbiomes found in other species. In different human studies, <lb/>endometrial microbiomes ranged from Bacteroides predominance [51], Prevotella, Fusobacter-<lb/>ium, and Jonquetella Predominance [44, 70], to Flavobacterium and Lactobacillus predomi-<lb/>nance [49]. We found all these organisms with the exception of Jonquetella among our <lb/>samples. However, they were present in very low abundance (S1 Table). In dairy cattle, most <lb/>abundant genera were Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, Coxiella, Porphyromonas, and class Gam-<lb/>maproteobacteria [71, 72]. We did not observe any Coxiella in bitches. We observed similar <lb/>differences in vaginal microbiomes as well suggesting that core endometrial and vaginal <lb/>microbiomes tend to be species-specific. A few attempts have been made at isolating microbes <lb/>from the canine endometrium using culture-based techniques [3-6]. The success rate at isolat-<lb/>ing bacteria ranged from 3.8% [4] to 62.5% [6] proving that most endometrial microbes are <lb/>not amenable to culture using standard techniques. Most prevalent organisms isolated in these <lb/>studies were Staphylococcus, Mycoplasma and in one study Streptococcus [4]. Staphylococcus <lb/>was the second-most abundant organism in our study whereas Mycoplasma and Streptococcus <lb/>were much rarer. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are also easily cultured under standard <lb/>technology explaining their abundance in culture-based studies. <lb/>Intriguingly, the most abundant organisms in the canine endometrium belonged to the <lb/>genus Pseudomonas and was identified in all endometrial samples. Pseudomonas spp is often <lb/>associated with pyometra in bitches [73] but has not been reported in a healthy endometrium. <lb/>The SILVA database [26] was used to classify OTUs and does not allow taxonomic classifica-<lb/>tion at species level. Although indirect evidence suggests that the genus Pseudomonas in the <lb/>canine endometrium consists of several species, the exact identity of the organisms remain <lb/>unknown. Staphylococcus, the genus with second highest abundance in the endometrium has <lb/>been isolated from the canine endometrium in previous studies [3, 5, 6]. Campylobacter repre-<lb/>sented 5.8% of organisms identified in the endometrium and seems to be a major representa-<lb/>tive of the canine endometrial microbiome. Although Campylobacter associated reproductive <lb/>tract pathology has not been reported in bitches, different species of Campylobacter has been <lb/>implicated in abortions in cattle and sheep [74, 75]. <lb/>The prevalent explanation for the presence of microbes in the uterus was that they always <lb/>are introduced as an ascending infection from the vagina through an open cervix during pro-<lb/>estrus and estrus. To test this hypothesis, we compared the vaginal and uterine microbiomes of <lb/>the five bitches in estrus (Fig 6). Contrary to the prevailing notion, we did not find a correla-<lb/>tion between the vaginal and uterine microbiomes of any of the bitches suggesting that the <lb/>endometrium has its own resident microbiome and it was not established as an ascending <lb/>infection from the vagina [76, 77]. <lb/>Since the focus of this study was to ascertain the presence of an endometrial microbiome of <lb/>healthy bitches and to compare the microbiome across different stages of estrous, we did not <lb/>analyze the effect of breed and age of the animal (other than pre-pubertal animals). The source <lb/>of our experimental animals (local humane society) would have made reliable age and breed <lb/>estimates difficult. Although it is possible for breed differences in reproductive tract micro-<lb/>biomes to exist, many studies have found no differences in resident microbiomes of animals of <lb/>different breeds housed in similar conditions [78-80]. We found the diversity and richness of <lb/>microbiomes of pre-pubertal animals to be significantly different from older animals (Fig 3). <lb/>Both breeds and ages were rough phenotypic estimates as all of these animals were obtained <lb/>from a local Humane Society and most looked crossbred. We were intrigued to find a rich, <lb/>diverse uterine microbiome even in the youngest pre-pubertal animals used in the study. <lb/></body>

			<body>Conclusions <lb/>From this study, we conclude that both the endometrium and the vagina have rich microbial <lb/>ecosystems. The endometrium is much more diverse than the vagina. The endometrial micro-<lb/>biome does not change with the stage of the estrous cycle. Whereas the vaginal environment in <lb/>estrus (i.e. in heat) is significantly different from other stages of estrous. There is no age or <lb/>breed effect, while significant animal-to-animal variation in endometrial and vaginal micro-<lb/>biome does exist. We conclude from our results as well as past studies that culture-based sys-<lb/>tems miss the great diversity present in both diseased and healthy reproductive tracts. Given <lb/>this diversity, there is much to be studied relative to the intra-microbiota interactions and spe-<lb/>cies-intrinsic factors that may be more relevant to maintaining a state of balance and health <lb/>and that an imbalance of these factors maybe more important in the development of uterine <lb/>disease than the abundance of any given bacterial species. <lb/></body>
