A number of alter-<lb/>natives to T 2 , which are robust to covariance heterogeneity, have been proposed in <lb/>the literature. However, all are sensitive to departures from multivariate normal-<lb/>ity. We demonstrate how to obtain multivariate tests that are robust to covariance <lb/>heterogeneity and non-normality with estimators of location and scale based on <lb/>trimming and Winsorizing. The performance of six alternatives to T 2 was examined <lb/>via Monte Carlo methods when characteristics of the research design, degree of co-<lb/>variance heterogeneity, and degree of non-normality were manipulated. We have <lb/>recently developed a program written in the SAS/IML language that can be used to <lb/>implement these robust multivariate tests.

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Medical researchers are frequently interested in <lb/>testing hypotheses about the efficacy of treatments <lb/>for two independent groups of subjects. Treatment <lb/>effectiveness is often assessed using multiple out-<lb/>come variables [1-3], such as physiological re-<lb/>sponses and subjective assessments of quality of <lb/>life [4]. <lb/></body>

			<body>Student&apos;s t-statistic is the conventional approach <lb/>for testing the equality of population means for <lb/>two independent groups on a single outcome vari-<lb/>able when population variances are equal and the <lb/>data are normally distributed. It is well known that <lb/>Student&apos;s t is sensitive to departures from the as-<lb/>sumption of variance homogeneity and that Welch&apos;s <lb/>statistic [5] should be favored when variances are <lb/>unequal. However, because Welch&apos;s statistic is sen-<lb/>sitive to departures from a normal distribution, <lb/>Reed [6] considered a modification when normality <lb/>can not be assumed. A robust test can be obtained <lb/>by trimming/Winsorizing the most extreme obser-<lb/>vations from the tails of a distribution, a solution <lb/>0169-2607/$ -see front matter © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

			<body>recommended by Yuen and Dixon [7] and Yuen [8], <lb/>prior to computing Welch&apos;s statistic. <lb/>The multivariate extension of Student&apos;s t-<lb/>procedure, Hotelling&apos;s T 2 [9], tests the equality of <lb/>means on multiple outcome variables. The T 2 test <lb/>rests on the assumptions of equality of the group <lb/>covariances and a joint normal distribution for the <lb/>outcomes. T 2 is biased when covariances are het-<lb/>erogeneous [10-12], particularly when the design is <lb/>unbalanced, that is, when group sizes are unequal. <lb/>A number of alternatives, which are robust (i.e., <lb/>insensitive) to covariance heterogeneity, have been <lb/>proposed in the literature [13-19]. Like T 2 , all of <lb/>these procedures rely on the assumption of multi-<lb/>variate normality. <lb/>When the data are obtained from non-normal <lb/>distributions, multivariate procedures for testing <lb/>mean equality will produce biased results, partic-<lb/>ularly when the design is unbalanced [10,20-23]. <lb/>Wilcox [23] demonstrated that a two-group multi-<lb/>variate procedure, which is robust to the effects of <lb/>both covariance heterogeneity and non-normality <lb/>may be obtained by substituting robust estimators <lb/>for the usual (i.e., least-squares) means and covari-<lb/>ances in procedures, which are robust to covariance <lb/>heterogeneity. More specifically, Wilcox derived ro-<lb/>bust analogues of the Johansen [24] and Kim [16] <lb/>procedures by replacing least-squares estimators <lb/>with estimators based on trimming/Winsorization. <lb/>He observed that both of these robust procedures <lb/>controlled the rate of Type I errors to the nominal <lb/>level of significance, α, when covariances were het-<lb/>erogeneous and the data were non-normal. More-<lb/>over, these procedures were more powerful than <lb/>those based on least-squares estimators when the <lb/>data were obtained from skewed or heavy-tailed <lb/>distributions. <lb/>Fouladi and Yockey [25] examined six alterna-<lb/>tives to Hotelling&apos;s T 2 [9] under conditions of co-<lb/>variance heterogeneity, including James&apos; first and <lb/>second-order [14], Johansen [24], Kim [16], Nel and <lb/>van der Merwe [17], and Yao [19] procedures. None <lb/>of the procedures demonstrated superior perfor-<lb/>mance across all data-analytic conditions; each was <lb/>influenced by such factors as total sample size, the <lb/>ratio of the group sizes, the correlation between <lb/>outcome variables, and the ratio of the group sizes <lb/>to the number of outcome variables. While Fouladi <lb/>and Yockey [25] observed that the presence of non-<lb/>normal data did not have an adverse effect on the <lb/>Type I error control of the alternate procedures, <lb/>they considered only very modest departures from <lb/>normality. Previous research has demonstrated the <lb/>sensitivity of multivariate procedures to departures <lb/>from normality, particularly when the distributions <lb/>are skewed [26]. <lb/>This paper extends previous research by Reed <lb/>[6] on robust tests for two-group univariate de-<lb/>signs to the multivariate context. The Type I error <lb/>performance of several alternatives to Hotelling&apos;s <lb/>T 2 [9] test under departures from the assumptions <lb/>of covariance homogeneity and multivariate nor-<lb/>mality are compared. The investigated procedures <lb/>include those considered by Fouladi and Yockey <lb/>[25] in addition to a multivariate extension of <lb/>the Brown-Forsythe [27] procedure [28,29]. These <lb/>tests are investigated when least-squares estima-<lb/>tors are employed and when least-squares esti-<lb/>mators are replaced with robust estimators based <lb/>on trimming/Winsorization. A computer program to <lb/>implement these robust strategies is described and <lb/>a numeric example is presented. <lb/>2. Methods with least-squares <lb/>estimators <lb/>Let Y ij = [Y ij1 ••• Y ijp ] represent the vector of p out-<lb/>come measurements for the ith subject in the jth <lb/>group (i = 1, . . ., n j ; j = 1, 2; N = n j ). It is assumed <lb/>that Y ij follows a multivariate normal distribution <lb/>with mean j and variance-covariance matrix j <lb/>(i.e., Y ij ∼ N[ j , j ]). The vector j = [µ j1 , µ j2 , . . ., <lb/>µ jp ] is estimated byȲ j = [Ȳ j1Ȳj2 • • •Ȳ jp ] and j is <lb/>estimated by S j. The null hypothesis is: <lb/>H 0 : 1 = 2 . <lb/>(1) <lb/>The Brown-Forsythe (BF; [27]) procedure is <lb/>based on the test statistic, <lb/>T BF = (Ȳ 1 −Ȳ 2 ) <lb/>T [w • <lb/>1 S 1 + w • <lb/>2 S 2 ] −1 (Ȳ 1 −Ȳ 2 ), <lb/>(2) <lb/>where w • <lb/>j = 1 − w j and w j = n j /N. This T-statistic <lb/>can be expressed as an F-statistic, <lb/>F BF = <lb/>ν BF2 <lb/>pf B2 <lb/>T BF , <lb/>(3) <lb/>where ν BF2 = f B2 − p + 1 and <lb/>f B2 = <lb/>tr(G 1 ) 2 + tr 2 (G 1 ) <lb/>1 <lb/>n 1 − 1 <lb/>tr(w • <lb/>1 S 1 ) 2 + tr 2 (w • <lb/>1 S 1 ) <lb/>+ <lb/>1 <lb/>n 2 − 1 <lb/>tr(w • <lb/>2 S 2 ) 2 + tr 2 (w • <lb/>2 S 2 ) <lb/>. <lb/>(4) <lb/>In Eq. (4), tr denotes the trace of a matrix and <lb/>G 1 = w • <lb/>1 S 1 + w • <lb/>2 S 2 . The original df formulation pro-<lb/>vided by Brown and Forsythe results in a test pro-<lb/>cedure that is not asymptotically correct. The df <lb/>calculations suggested by Mehrotra [30] (see also <lb/>[29]) is recommended instead. Accordingly, the test <lb/></body>

			<body>the greatest integer ≤x. The sample trimmed mean <lb/>is: <lb/>Y t = <lb/>1 <lb/>h j <lb/>n j −g j <lb/>i=g+1 <lb/>Y (i)j , <lb/>(17) <lb/>where h j = n j − 2g j . Both fixed and adaptive trim-<lb/>ming rules have been proposed in the literature. <lb/>With the former, a fixed proportion of the obser-<lb/>vations is trimmed from each tail of the distri-<lb/>bution; between 10% and 20% trimming is recom-<lb/>mended [31]. With an adaptive trimming approach, <lb/>the amount of trimming in each tail is determined <lb/>based on summary descriptive measures of distri-<lb/>bution shape. A fixed 20% trimming approach was <lb/>adopted in the present study, consistent with the <lb/>work of Wilcox [23]. <lb/>The Winsorized variance is the theoretically cor-<lb/>rect measure of scale that corresponds to the <lb/>trimmed mean [8]. To obtain the Winsorized vari-<lb/>ance, first compute the sample Winsorized mean, <lb/>Y wj = <lb/>1 <lb/>n j <lb/>n j <lb/>i=1 <lb/>Z ij . <lb/>(18) <lb/>where <lb/>Z ij = <lb/> <lb/>  <lb/>  <lb/>Y (g j +1)j if Y ij ≤ Y (g j +1)j <lb/>Y ij <lb/>if Y (g j +1)j &lt; Y ij &lt; Y (n j −g j )j <lb/>Y (n j −g j )j if Y ij ≥ Y (n j −g j )j <lb/>. <lb/>The Winsorized variance is <lb/>s 2 <lb/>wj = <lb/>n j <lb/>i=1 <lb/>(Z ij −Ȳ wj ) <lb/>2 <lb/>(n j − 1) <lb/>, <lb/>(19) <lb/>and the standard error of the trimmed mean is (n j − <lb/>1)s 2 <lb/>wj /[h j (h j − 1)]. <lb/>For multivariate data, the Winsorized covariance <lb/>for outcome variables l and l (l, l = 1, . . ., p) is <lb/>s wjll = <lb/>n j <lb/>i=1 <lb/>(Z ijl −Ȳ wjl )(Z ijl −Ȳ wjll ) <lb/>(n j − 1) <lb/>, <lb/>(20) <lb/>and the estimate of error covariance is (n j − <lb/>1)s w jll /[h j (h j − 1)]. <lb/>A test which is robust to the biasing effects <lb/>of both multivariate non-normality and covariance <lb/>heterogeneity can be obtained by using one of the <lb/>BF, J2, J, K, NV, or Y test statistics, and substitut-<lb/>ing trimmed means and the Winsorized covariance <lb/>matrix for the least-squares mean and covariance <lb/>matrix [23]. For example, with robust estimators, <lb/>the T 2 statistic of Eq. (6) becomes <lb/>T t2 = (Ȳ t1 −Ȳ t2 ) <lb/>T (n 1 − 1)S w1 <lb/>h 1 (h 1 − 1) <lb/>+ <lb/>(n 2 − 1)S w2 <lb/>h 2 (h 2 − 1) <lb/>−1 <lb/>×(Ȳ t1 −Ȳ t2 ), <lb/>(21) <lb/>whereȲ tj and S wj are the trimmed mean vector and <lb/>Winsorized covariance matrix for the jth group, re-<lb/>spectively. Note that trimming is conducted inde-<lb/>pendently for each dimension of the data [26]. <lb/>4. Simulation methods <lb/>A Monte Carlo study was used to evaluate the Type <lb/>I error performance of Hotelling&apos;s T 2 [9] and the six <lb/>alternatives for the two-group multivariate prob-<lb/>lem. Eight factors were manipulated in the study. <lb/>These were: (a) number of outcome variables, (b) <lb/>degree of correlation between outcome variables, <lb/>(c) total sample size, (d) degree of group size bal-<lb/>ance/imbalance, (e) equality/inequality of group <lb/>covariance matrices, (f) degree of inequality of <lb/>group covariance matrices, (g) nature of the pair-<lb/>ing of group sizes and group covariance matrices, <lb/>and (h) population distribution. The choice of fac-<lb/>tor levels was based on previous research. <lb/>The value of p, the number of outcome vari-<lb/>ables, was set at two, four, and eight. The degree <lb/>of correlation among the outcome variables, was <lb/>set at ρ = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.8. Without loss of general-<lb/>ity, the correlation was introduced for the second-<lb/>group only, while the intercorrelation among the <lb/>outcome variables for the first group was set at <lb/>ρ = 0 [25]. <lb/>Small, moderate, and large total sample size <lb/>conditions were examined for each value of p such <lb/>that the total number of observations ranged from <lb/>18 to 192. For p = 2, the ratio of N/p was set at 9, <lb/>18, and 24, while for p = 4 and 8 this ratio was set <lb/>at 9, 12, and 24. Both balanced and unbalanced de-<lb/>signs were considered in the study. When the design <lb/>was unbalanced, the group size conditions were se-<lb/>lected to represent a range of values for the ratio of <lb/>the smallest group size to p (i.e., n min /p) and the <lb/>corresponding coefficient of variation of the group <lb/>sizes, n j , where <lb/>n j = <lb/>J <lb/>j=1 <lb/>(n j −n) <lb/>2 /J <lb/>n <lb/>, <lb/>(22) <lb/>andn = n j /J.

In <lb/>the moderate inequality case, the matrices were in <lb/>the ratio of 1:5. In the large covariance inequality <lb/>case, the matrices were in a ratio of 1:9. <lb/>Both positive and negative pairings of group sizes <lb/>and covariance matrices were investigated. A pos-<lb/>itive pairing refers to the case in which the largest <lb/>n j is associated with the covariance matrix contain-<lb/>ing the largest element values; a negative pairing <lb/>refers to the case in which the largest n j is associ-<lb/>ated with the covariance matrix with the smallest <lb/>element values. <lb/>Type I error rates were obtained when the data <lb/>were both multivariate normal and non-normal in <lb/>form. For the former, pseudorandom observation <lb/>vectors Y ij from a multivariate normal distribution <lb/>with mean vector ␤ j and covariance matrix j were <lb/>obtained using the SAS generator RANNOR [32]. To <lb/>obtain each Y ij , a row vector of p deviates in which <lb/>each element has a standard normal distribution <lb/>(i.e., Z ij ), was transformed to a vector of multi-<lb/>variate observations via a triangular (Cholesky) de-<lb/>composition <lb/>Y ij = ␤ j + LZ T <lb/>ij , <lb/>(23) <lb/>where L is a upper triangular matrix of dimension p <lb/>satisfying the equality L T L = j . Three non-normal <lb/>distributions were investigated: heavy-tailed, mod-<lb/>erately skewed, and highly skewed. The heavy-<lb/>tailed distribution had skewness (γ 1 ) and kurto-<lb/>sis (γ 2 ) values equivalent to those of a double-<lb/>exponential distribution (i.e., γ 1 = 0; γ 2 = 3). The <lb/>moderately skewed distribution had the same skew-<lb/>ness and kurtosis values as an exponential distribu-<lb/>tion (i.e., γ 1 = 2; γ 2 = 6). The highly skewed distribu-<lb/>tion had γ 1 = 6.18 and γ 2 = 110.93, which are equiv-<lb/>alent to the shape parameters of a lognormal distri-<lb/>bution. The non-normal data were generated by the <lb/>method developed by Fleishman [33] and extended <lb/>to the multivariate situation by Vale and Maurelli <lb/>[34]. <lb/>The simulation program was written in the <lb/>SAS/Interactive Matrix Language (IML) pro-<lb/>gramming language [35]. For each of the <lb/>3 × 3 × 3 × 4 = 108 combinations of p, ρ, N, and <lb/>population distribution, we examined both equal <lb/>and unequal covariance matrices for balanced and <lb/>unbalanced designs. Five thousand replications <lb/>of each condition were performed using a 0.05 <lb/>significance level. For each replication, the seven <lb/>statistics were computed using least-squares and <lb/>robust estimators. <lb/>Descriptive analyses of empirical Type I error <lb/>rates and of the percentage of bias in the error <lb/>rates, B = 100(α − α)/α, were conducted. Inferen-<lb/>tial analyses involved a between-subjects factorial <lb/>analysis of variance (ANOVA), to assess the signif-<lb/>icance of each of the simulation variables in ex-<lb/>plaining variation in empirical error rates. Sepa-<lb/>rate ANOVA models were defined for balanced and <lb/>unbalanced designs. For the former, a base model <lb/>was defined that included main effect predictors <lb/>only: number of outcome variables (VAR), corre-<lb/>lation between outcome variables (CORR), total <lb/>sample size (NTOT), covariance structure (homo-<lb/>geneous, heterogeneous: COV), and population dis-<lb/>tribution (POPTYPE). For the latter, two different <lb/>base models, each containing only main effect pre-<lb/>dictors, were defined. The first base model con-<lb/>tained VAR, CORR, NTOT, POPTYPE, as well as the <lb/>pairing of group sizes and covariance matrices (pos-<lb/>itive, negative: PAIR), and the degree of covari-<lb/>ance inequality (RATIO). The second included all of <lb/>these predictors except NTOT, which was replaced <lb/>by n j , the coefficient of variation of group size <lb/>inequality (CV).

According to Bradley&apos;s liberal <lb/>criterion, a procedure is robust if its empirical error <lb/>rate falls within the interval from 0.025 to 0.075 <lb/>for α = 0.05. A procedure was considered liberal if <lb/>its empirical Type I error rate was greater than the <lb/>upper bound of this criterion, while a procedure <lb/>was considered conservative if its error rate was <lb/>below the lower bound of this criterion. <lb/>5.

The predictors were statistically sig-<lb/>nificant in all of the models, with the exception of <lb/>CORR, which was only significant in the model for <lb/>the J procedure, NTOT, which was not significant <lb/>in the models for the H, BF, N, and Y procedures, <lb/>and VAR, which was not significant in the model for <lb/>the BF procedure. The proportion of variation ex-<lb/>plained by the base model predictors was higher <lb/>for robust estimators than for least-squares estima-<lb/>tors for all test procedures. The explained variation <lb/>ranged from 0.56 for the NV test to 0.96 for J. For <lb/>robust estimators, all of the predictors in the base <lb/>model were significant with the exception of CORR, <lb/>which was a non-significant predictor for the H and <lb/>J2 procedures. <lb/>The full model contained main effect predic-<lb/>tors as well as the two-way interactions of POP-<lb/>TYPE × NTOT and POPTYPE × COV.

			<body>els. The proportion of variation explained by the <lb/>model increased by 0.11-0.36 due to this vari-<lb/>able alone when least-squares estimators were <lb/>adopted. For test procedures based on robust <lb/>estimators, the increase in explained variation <lb/>due to POPTYPE × NTOT and POPTYPE × COV was <lb/>much smaller than for least-squares estimators, <lb/>and ranged from 0.01 to 0.19. Consequently, <lb/>the model accounted for slightly less varia-<lb/>tion in the data when robust estimators were <lb/>adopted than when least-squares estimators were <lb/>adopted. <lb/>Descriptive analyses revealed that when the de-<lb/>sign was balanced and covariances were equal, <lb/>the mean percentages of Type I errors were con-<lb/>tained within the bounds of Bradley&apos;s [36] lib-<lb/>eral criterion for the entire set of test proce-<lb/>dures when least-squares estimators were adopted, <lb/>even when the data were non-normal. When <lb/>covariances were heterogeneous, this was not <lb/>the case. For both the moderately skewed and <lb/>highly skewed distributions, mean error rates fre-<lb/>quently exceeded the upper bound of Bradley&apos;s <lb/>criterion when least-squares estimators were <lb/>adopted but not when trimmed estimators were <lb/>adopted. <lb/>5.2. ANOVA results for unbalanced designs <lb/>For unbalanced designs, the two base models, <lb/>which contained the CV and NTOT predictors, re-<lb/>spectively, explained a similar proportion of the <lb/>variation in the data for all but the J procedure, <lb/>for which CV was a better predictor of Type I error <lb/>rates than NTOT. Hence, we selected the former <lb/>base model for our model comparisons. The pro-<lb/>portion of variation explained by the predictors in <lb/>the base model ranged from 0.42 for K to 0.75 for <lb/>H for least-squares estimators (Table 2). For the H <lb/>procedure, all predictors were significant with the <lb/>exception of CORR and POPTYPE. For the J2, J, NV, <lb/>and Y procedures, CORR was a non-significant pre-<lb/>dictor. CV was a non-significant predictor for the BF, <lb/>J2, and K procedures. RATIO was not significant for <lb/>the Y procedure, and VAR was not significant for the <lb/>BF procedure. <lb/>When trimmed estimators were adopted, the <lb/>proportion of variation explained by predictors in <lb/>the base model ranged from 0.52 for the K proce-<lb/>dure to 0.76 for the H procedure. CORR was a non-<lb/>significant predictor for the J2 and J procedures, <lb/>while RATIO was non-significant for the Y proce-<lb/>dure. VAR was non-significant only for the H pro-<lb/>cedure, as was POPTYPE. The PAIR variable was not <lb/>significant for the J2 procedure. <lb/>For the full model, which included main ef-<lb/>fect predictors and both POPTYPE × CV and POP-<lb/>TYPE × PAIR, the proportion of explained variation <lb/>increased between 0.01 and 0.34 for least-squares <lb/>estimators and between 0.01 and 0.16 for trimmed <lb/>estimators. The interaction terms were significant <lb/>in all of the full models for least-squares estima-<lb/>tors, with the exception of the model for the H <lb/>procedure, where neither were significant. In the <lb/>full models for procedures based on trimmed esti-<lb/>mators, POPTYPE × CV was not significant for the <lb/>H and Y procedures, while POPTYPE × PAIR was not <lb/>significant for the H procedure. <lb/>Descriptive analyses (Table 3) revealed that for <lb/>least-squares estimators, Type I error rates were <lb/>substantially different for positive and negative <lb/>pairings of group sizes and covariance matrices <lb/>when the data were obtained from multivariate <lb/>normal and non-normal distributions. This variation <lb/>was less obvious when trimmed estimators were <lb/>adopted. Table 3 contains the mean percentages <lb/>of Type I error for all of the investigated proce-<lb/>dures for positive and negative pairings of group <lb/>sizes and covariance matrices. For positive pairings, <lb/>mean error rates were contained within the bounds <lb/>of Bradley&apos;s [36] liberal criterion for both least-<lb/>squares and trimmed estimators for all but the H <lb/>and J procedures. Error rates for the former were <lb/>conservative, while those for the latter were lib-<lb/>eral; the degree of liberalness was greater for non-<lb/>normal distributions when least-squares estimators <lb/>were adopted than when robust estimators were <lb/>adopted. In particular, the J procedure with least-<lb/>squares estimators tended to be quite liberal when <lb/>the ratio of n min /p was 3 or less and/or when n j <lb/>was large. For example, the mean Type I error rate <lb/>for n min /p = 4.5 when n j = 1.22 was 6.35 for nor-<lb/>mally distributed data when least-squares estima-<lb/>tors were adopted and was 5.88 when robust esti-<lb/>mators were adopted. However, when n min /p = 4.5 <lb/>when n j = 6.12, the mean error rates were 9.74 <lb/>and 6.44 for least-squares and trimmed estimators, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>For negative pairings, liberal values were ob-<lb/>served for the H procedure across all of the inves-<lb/>tigated population distributions. For the remaining <lb/>six procedures, liberal results were obtained for the <lb/>moderately and highly skewed distributions when <lb/>least-squares estimators were adopted for all but <lb/>the K procedure in the latter distribution. When <lb/>trimmed estimators were adopted, the NV and Y <lb/>procedures produced liberal values for both the <lb/>moderately and highly skewed distributions, while <lb/>the BF procedure was conservative for the normal <lb/>distribution, and the K procedure was conservative <lb/>for the heavy-tailed distribution. <lb/></body>

The degree of variation in <lb/>bias increased only slightly when the data were ob-<lb/>tained from a heavy-tailed distribution (−23.18% to <lb/>20.26%); the greatest degree of positive bias was for <lb/>the J procedure and the greatest degree of negative <lb/>bias was for the K procedure. For the moderately <lb/>skewed distribution, the procedures based on least-<lb/>squares estimators exhibited positive bias ranging <lb/>from 30.86% (K) to 98.44% (J).

For the remaining procedures, we provide an F-statistic. <lb/>no single procedure will perform well in all data-<lb/>analytic situations. As the results demonstrate, the <lb/>Brown and Forsythe [27], James second-order [14], <lb/>and Kim [16] procedures are frequently conserva-<lb/>tive. The Johansen procedure [24] is sensitive to <lb/>the relationship between group sizes and the di-<lb/>mensionality of the data, and will produce liberal <lb/>values when the ratio of the smallest group size to <lb/>the number of outcome variables is small, or when <lb/>the degree of group size imbalance is large. The <lb/>Nel and van der Merwe [17]and Yao [19] procedures <lb/>were more liberal than other procedures when the <lb/>group with the smallest sample size exhibited the <lb/>largest degree of covariance heterogeneity. <lb/>Based on these findings, we recommend that re-<lb/>searchers adopt procedures based on trimmed esti-<lb/>mators if the assumption of multivariate normality <lb/>is untenable. If the degree of group size imbalance <lb/>is large, and the ratio of the smallest group size <lb/>to the number of outcome variables is small, the <lb/>Johansen procedure[24] should be avoided. If the <lb/>degree of covariance heterogeneity is large, then <lb/>Kim&apos;s procedure [16] should be considered, since <lb/>it was the only procedure in unbalanced designs, <lb/>which was insensitive to the degree of covariance <lb/>heterogeneity in the data. Overall, the Kim and <lb/>James second-order procedures based on robust es-<lb/>timators were less sensitive to the factors examined <lb/>in this study than the other four alternative proce-<lb/>dures. <lb/>7. Software and numeric example <lb/>We recently developed a computer program writ-<lb/>ten in version 8 of SAS&apos; Interactive Matrix Language <lb/>that can be used to implement these robust al-<lb/>ternatives with trimmed estimators [37]. This pro-<lb/>gram, along with instructions on its use, is avail-<lb/>able for downloading from the first author&apos;s web-<lb/>site, http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/∼lixlm. This <lb/>program requires that the data matrix of multi-<lb/>variate observations, group sizes, and proportion <lb/>of trimming be specified. For the current example, <lb/>we examined the procedures using 20% symmetric <lb/>trimming because this amount of trimming has been <lb/>often recommended in the literature. However, the <lb/>program user may select any amount of symmet-<lb/>ric trimming desired. The program will output sum-<lb/>mary descriptive information, including the multi-<lb/>variate group means and covariance matrices. The <lb/>test statistics, degrees of freedom, and p-values or <lb/>critical values for each of the procedures, as de-<lb/>fined in Sections 2 and 3, are produced. <lb/>We demonstrate the application of the program <lb/>using a data set obtained from Selvin [38] on ma-<lb/>ternal weights for 70 primiparous and 23 multi-<lb/>parous women (p. 223). Six measures of prepreg-<lb/>nancy, pregnancy, and postpartum weights, gains, <lb/>and losses were analyzed by Selvin using Hotelling&apos;s <lb/>T 2 [9]. We applied the robust alternatives to these <lb/>data. To illustrate the effect that extreme observa-<lb/>tions can have on the statistical tests when least-<lb/>squares estimators are adopted, we manipulated <lb/>the data so that a constant was added to the first <lb/>six observations for the last dependent variable for <lb/>the primiparous women. This modified data set is <lb/>available from the authors on request. <lb/>The results generated by the SAS/IML program <lb/>are presented in Table 5. Note that with least-<lb/>squares estimators all procedures result in rejec-<lb/>tion of the null hypothesis of equality of multivari-<lb/>ate means for the two groups of women, while with <lb/>trimmed estimators the null hypothesis is retained. <lb/>In this example, all of the tests based on robust es-<lb/>timators lead to the same decision regarding the <lb/>null hypothesis. However, as the simulation results <lb/>reported in this paper indicate, this will not neces-<lb/>sarily be the case for all data sets. <lb/></body>
