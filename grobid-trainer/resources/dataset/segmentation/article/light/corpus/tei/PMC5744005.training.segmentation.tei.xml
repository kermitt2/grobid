            <body>inTrODUcTiOn <lb/>Early brain injury (EBI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hem-<lb/>orrhage (aSAH) repeatedly has been associated with a rise of <lb/>inflammatory parameters measured in serum and cerebrospi-<lb/>nal fluid (CSF). However, results are ambiguous concerning the <lb/>prognostic value of inflammatory serum or CSF parameters. <lb/>Several studies have proposed single inflammatory markers to <lb/>be predictive for delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or outcome <lb/>(1-8). Thus far, due to the wide individual and interindividual <lb/>range, inflammatory parameters are limited serving as bio-<lb/>markers to detect complications as DCI or to predict outcome <lb/>on an individual basis. However, current data are heterogene-<lb/>ous and partly conflicting as there is no consensus, e.g., on the <lb/>compartment for sample acquisition (serum or CSF or extra-<lb/>cellular fluid-ECF-acquired via microdialysis) or the time <lb/>point for sampling. Neuroinflammation is a major aspect of <lb/>EBI. However, it remains a challenge to differentiate beneficial <lb/>from devastating inflammatory components. Furthermore, the <lb/>inflammatory response to the initial injury consists of various <lb/>components such as cellular reactions as in terms of micro-<lb/>glia activation (9), induction of cytokines and chemokines <lb/>(1, 8, 10), leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions (11), and <lb/>modulation of receptor expression (12). A complex pattern of <lb/>immunoreaction is initiated after aSAH. Besides the inflam-<lb/>matory activation, there are various other pathophysiological <lb/>reactions, which are initiated after SAH; such as microthrom-<lb/>bosis, cortical spreading depolarization, microvasospasm, <lb/>and blood-brain barrier breakdown, altogether resulting in <lb/>dysfunction of the cerebral microcirculation (13). In turn, <lb/>microcirculatory dysfunction may aggravate the inflammatory <lb/>activation. Thus, the interactions of the initiated reactions <lb/>hamper the interpretation of a single parameter&apos;s dynamics. <lb/>There is a vast amount of data on inflammatory parameters <lb/>after aSAH usually in search for biomarkers predicting DCI. <lb/>However, none of the examined parameters has found its way <lb/>into clinical routine. This is most likely due to the abovemen-<lb/>tioned enormous individual and interindividual range and the <lb/>low specificity of inflammatory parameters in general. Here, <lb/>we present our data from a prospective observational study <lb/>to illustrate the courses of various inflammatory parameters <lb/>after aSAH. We hypothesize that monitoring of inflammatory <lb/>parameters during the acute phase after aSAH does not allow <lb/>an individual risk estimation (e.g., regarding the occurrence <lb/>of DCI). However, detailed documentation of a vast amount <lb/>of parameters may increase the understanding of the patho-<lb/>physiological reaction after aSAH. Sophisticated knowledge of <lb/>the pro-inflammatory reaction after aSAH and its interactions <lb/>may possibly allow identification of specific anti-inflammatory <lb/>therapeutic approaches. <lb/>Taken together, we aim to demonstrate that individual <lb/>risk estimation for secondary complications after aSAH using <lb/>inflammatory biomarkers is not promising. Instead, we vote for <lb/>a multicenter database clarifying the courses and interactions of <lb/>inflammatory parameters after aSAH to provide deeper insight of <lb/>the pathophysiology of EBI. <lb/>MaTerials anD MeThODs <lb/>The prospective cohort study was approved by the local ethics <lb/>committee (Ethikkommission an der Medizinischen Fakultät <lb/>der Rheinischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, <lb/>Germany; EK 199/08), written informed consent according to <lb/>the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from patients or legal <lb/>representatives. Data from this study have already been published <lb/>elsewhere (8, 14, 15). A total of 109 consecutive patients with <lb/>aSAH were screened for eligibility within a 21-month period. <lb/>Patients were not eligible if they were younger than 18 years, <lb/>enrolled in other clinical trials, admitted more than 12 h after <lb/>onset or if informed consent could not be obtained. Due to these <lb/>criteria, 28 patients were excluded (n = 15 declined participation <lb/>or data were lost, n = 9 were delayed admitted, n = 4 participated <lb/>in another trial). We documented demographic, clinical, labora-<lb/>tory, and radiological data within an anonymized file history. <lb/>Inflammatory parameters in serum and CSF were assessed at <lb/>days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 after aSAH. CSF was tested in patients <lb/>with necessity for CSF drainage mostly due to hydrocephalus <lb/>(n = 48). Sample acquisition regularly took place in line with <lb/>routine diagnostic (between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m.). <lb/>sample Processing <lb/>Blood and CSF samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 × g <lb/>before processing. Samples were analyzed at the Department <lb/>of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology, University <lb/>of Bonn, either as part of routine diagnostics [leukocyte count <lb/>(G/L), determination of C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/L), and <lb/>interleukin 6 (IL6, pg/mL)] or for study purposes, by means of <lb/>enzyme-linked immunofluorescence assays for determination <lb/>matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9, ng/mL), intercellular adhe-<lb/>sion molecule 1 (ICAM1, ng/mL), and leukemia inhibitory fac-<lb/>tor (LIF, pg/mL) in serum samples (all assays purchased by IBL <lb/>International GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). <lb/>analysis <lb/>Courses of serum parameters (all patients included), addition-<lb/>ally CSF parameters and the corresponding serum parameters <lb/>of the patients with CSF drainage were plotted dependent on <lb/>time of sample acquisition. Graphs were acquired using <lb/>GraphPad Prism ® 6. Furthermore, courses were analyzed using <lb/>the Mann-Whitney U test. Occurrence of DCI was used as <lb/>grouping variable to illustrate the usual approach in search of <lb/>a biomarker indicating the occurrence of DCI. Therefore, DCI <lb/>was defined as secondary neurologic worsening (increase in <lb/>modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale &gt;2 points). <lb/>Furthermore, clinical improvement after induced hypertension <lb/>and new cerebral ischemia or perfusion deficit confirmed by <lb/>cranial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging <lb/>(in case of consciousness or sedation or persistent neurologic <lb/>deficit) were defined as indicators of DCI (if not explained by <lb/>other causes such as embolism during angiography). Other <lb/>relevant known causes such as infection, seizure, and metabolic, <lb/>or electrolyte disturbances were excluded before determination <lb/>of DCI. Tests were carried out using SPSS ® 21. <lb/>FigUre | Time courses of interleukin 6 (IL6) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples [(a); IL6csf], serum samples of the patients with CSF samples [(B); IL6serum], <lb/>and all serum samples available [(c); IL6serum all] and their 95% confidence interval are displayed.

            <body>resUlTs <lb/>Baseline characteristics of the patients included is presented as <lb/>supplemental data table (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material). <lb/>Infectious complications occurred regularly with n = 8 (9.9%) at <lb/>day 1, n = 27 (33.3%) at day 4, n = 38 (46.9%) at day 7, n = 36 <lb/>(44.4%) at day 10, and n = 26 (32.1%) at day 14. <lb/>interleukin 6 <lb/>Serum course of IL6 differs from the pattern observed in CSF <lb/>samples (Figures 1B,C). The peak of the measured serum level <lb/>represents values obtained at day 1 after aSAH, whereas course <lb/>of IL6 in CSF peaks somewhat later (at day 4) (Figure 1A). CSF <lb/>values are far higher than serum levels (up to 10-fold). Of note, <lb/>confidence intervals especially for serum values are huge due to <lb/>the enormous variability of individual values. <lb/>Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 <lb/>Matrix metallopeptidase 9 peaks earlier in CSF samples (at day 4) <lb/>than in serum samples (at day 7) (Figure 2). Contrary to IL6, <lb/>MMP9 is found in patients&apos; serum in far higher concentrations <lb/>then in CSF. <lb/>intercellular adhesion Molecule 1 <lb/>Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 is detectable in all of the <lb/>acquired serum samples. In CSF samples, lower limit of detection <lb/>(6.3 ng/mL) was not reached in 45.8% (n = 22) of the samples. <lb/>Highest value of CSF ICAM1 expression was 56.8 ng/mL. Of note, <lb/>the peak of the course is observed at day 4 after aSAH (Figure 3). <lb/>However, variability especially at day 4 is extraordinary high. <lb/>leukemia inhibitory Factor <lb/>Leukemia inhibitory factor was detected reliably in patients&apos; CSF <lb/>samples (LOD: 3.13 pg/mL). The course of LIF measured in CSF <lb/>differs a lot from the one measured in serum samples (Figure 4): <lb/>in CSF, a very early peak is observed followed by a rapid drop <lb/>(Figure 4A). The assessed CSF levels are quite homogeneous <lb/>demonstrated by low SDs. Serum levels of LIF are far lower (up <lb/>to 10-fold) (Figures 4B,C). <lb/>crP and leukocyte count <lb/>The levels of CRP and leukocyte count were only assessed in <lb/>serum samples. Of note, courses of CRP and leukocyte count act <lb/>almost inversely. At day 4 after aSAH CRP levels peaks (Figure 5), <lb/>whereas leukocyte count shows its nadir (Figure 6). <lb/>courses of inflammatory Parameters <lb/>related to Dci <lb/>In 18 patients (22.2%), occurrence of DCI was detected (day 3: <lb/>n = 1; day 4: n = 5; day 6: n = 2; day 7: n = 8; day 9: n = 1; day 10: <lb/>n = 1).

Especially course of CRP was related to Fisher grading: <lb/>the measured values significantly differed related to dichotomized <lb/>Fisher scale score at day 1 (p = 0.019), day 4 (p = 0.001), and day <lb/>(p = 0.033; Mann-Whitney U test). Significant difference was <lb/>also seen for serum IL6 at day 1 (p = 0.006) and day 4 (p = 0.002), <lb/>further for serum LIF at day 7 (p = 0.038; Mann-Whitney U test). <lb/>All courses are displayed in Figure 8. <lb/>courses of inflammatory Parameters <lb/>related to WFns scale score <lb/>Courses of inflammatory parameters also have been related <lb/>to the impact of hemorrhage expressed according to WFNS <lb/>scale score, which may reflect the EBI.

            <body>compared with the WFNS A group (day 1: p = 0.039; day 4: <lb/>p = 0.034; Mann-Whitney U test). <lb/>No significant differences related to dichotomized WFNS scale <lb/>score were found for leukocyte count, MMP9, LIF, and ICAM. <lb/>All courses are displayed in Figure 9. <lb/>DiscUssiOn <lb/>Here, we illustrate the courses of several inflammatory para-<lb/>meters (IL6, MMP9, ICAM1, and LIF) in CSF and serum samples <lb/>after aSAH, additionally courses of CRP and leukocyte count in <lb/>serum. The levels of IL6 and LIF are far higher in CSF samples <lb/>than in serum samples during the entire observation period, <lb/>whereas MMP9 and ICAM1 were detected in higher concentra-<lb/>tions in serum samples. The courses of CRP and leukocyte count <lb/>nearly act inversely. <lb/>Our evaluation of the measured values related to the occur-<lb/>rence of DCI illustrated the usual problem that the wide range of <lb/>the measured values hampers their interpretation and usage as a <lb/>biomarker. However, understanding the inflammatory response <lb/>after aSAH and generating a database may facilitate further stud-<lb/>ies: realistic sample size calculations on the basis of a multicenter <lb/>database will increase the quality and clinical relevance of the <lb/>acquired results. <lb/>Interleukin 6 is a pleiotropic cytokine. Its secretion is induced <lb/>by various stimuli (such as infectious disease, trauma, and other <lb/>causes of tissue damage, but also during chronic conditions, <lb/>e.g., depression or chronic pain). There are plenty of publica-<lb/>tions dealing with the influence of IL6 secretion after aSAH on <lb/>outcome and occurrence of DCI (1, 2, 8, 10, 14, 16-19). Time <lb/>courses of cytokine levels in CSF provided by us are similar to <lb/>those illustrated by Niwa and colleagues (10), However, others <lb/></body>

			<body>demonstrate a later peak (1, 20). In total, schedules for sampling <lb/>acquisition differ a lot among the previously mentioned studies; <lb/>thus, comparison of results or courses is hampered. Anyway, wide <lb/>ranges of IL6 levels are seen in all of the studies. Of note, related <lb/>to WFNS scale score IL6 levels were found to be indicators for <lb/>injury&apos;s severity in our study. Nevertheless, the usage of IL6 as a <lb/>biomarker is hampered by its non-specificity and its ambiguous <lb/>effect showing both pro-inflammatory and destructive as well as <lb/>regenerative aspects. <lb/>Higher levels of MMP9 have been associated with unfa-<lb/>vorable outcome (21). Similar to our data, SDs (i.e., variance of <lb/>measured values) are pronounced, and serum levels are more <lb/>than 10-fold higher than the CSF levels. <lb/>The interpretation of ICAM1 in CSF samples is hampered by <lb/>the LOD of the used assay, as the LOD was not reached in 45.8% <lb/>of the samples. The ICAM1 CSF levels in our cohort are somewhat <lb/>lower than those presented by Kaynar and colleagues (22), serum <lb/>levels are similar. Nevertheless, comparison of time course is not <lb/>possible due to different schedule for sample acquisition. Mack <lb/>and colleagues also have presented ICAM1 serum levels over <lb/>time after aSAH (23). Time courses seem to be similar; however, <lb/>serum levels measured are slightly lower. <lb/>There are no previous data on LIF after aSAH. We demonstrate <lb/>an early peak in CSF samples with far higher overall levels than <lb/>in serum samples. <lb/>Leukocyte count and CRP levels have been associated with <lb/>prognosis as well as vulnerability for DCI (5, 21, 24-27). Both <lb/>parameters are unspecific and therefore not useful as biomark-<lb/>ers. Anyway, pronounced leukocytosis seems to reflect severity <lb/>of disease and consecutively prognosis. <lb/>We present time courses of CSF and serum inflammatory <lb/>parameters after aSAH. The results of the study are limited <lb/>by the fact that time courses are displayed only descriptively. <lb/>Furthermore, sample size of the presented data is quite low. <lb/>However, we estimate that mere description is useful to under-<lb/>stand the complex inflammatory response after aSAH. <lb/>Due to their marginal specificity and wide interindividual <lb/>range, inflammatory parameters hardly serve as biomarkers. <lb/>Nevertheless, there is a distinct inflammatory response after <lb/>aSAH, which includes a vast spectrum of parameters interacting <lb/>with each other. Beneficial as well as damaging stimuli may result <lb/>from the inflammatory reaction. The interactions of this reaction <lb/>are poorly understood. As far as our experience goes, we hold <lb/>that further illustration of courses and possible interactions of <lb/>inflammatory reaction after aSAH is essential before associations <lb/>with outcome or occurrence of DCI in search for a biomarker are <lb/>promising. Generally, setting up multicenter databases to further <lb/>illustrate and hopefully understand inflammatory response after <lb/>aSAH has more prospect of success than searching for a single <lb/>biomarker resulting in controversial, clinically irrelevant results. <lb/>Furthermore, these data may lay the groundwork for further <lb/>studies&apos; realistic sample size calculations to create clinically rel-<lb/>evant and reliable results. Thus, we encourage everyone involved <lb/>in research of inflammation after aSAH to cooperate and build up <lb/>networks to share acquired data. <lb/></body>
