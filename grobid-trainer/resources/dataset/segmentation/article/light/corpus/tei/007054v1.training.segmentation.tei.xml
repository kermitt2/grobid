Email: hogenesc@mail.med.upenn.edu <lb/>Running Title: Mycoplasma contamination in RNA-Seq data <lb/>Keywords: Mycoplasma, RNA-Seq, contamination <lb/>2 <lb/>ABSTRACT <lb/>Mycoplasmas are notorious contaminants of cell culture and can have profound effects on <lb/>host cell biology by depriving cells of nutrients and inducing global changes in gene expression. <lb/>Because they are small, they can escape filtration in culture media. Because they lack cell walls, <lb/>they are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Over the last two decades, sentinel testing has <lb/>revealed wide-ranging contamination rates in mammalian culture. To obtain an unbiased <lb/>assessment from hundreds of labs, we analyzed sequence data from 9395 rodent and primate <lb/>samples from 884 series (or projects) in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. We found 11% of <lb/>these series were contaminated (defined as â‰¥ 100 reads/million mapping to mycoplasma in one <lb/>or more samples). Ninety percent of mycoplasma-mapped reads aligned to ribosomal RNA. <lb/>Interestingly, series using poly(A)-selection, which should bias against mycoplasma detection, <lb/>had comparable contamination rates as non-poly(A)-selected series. We also examined the <lb/>relationship between mycoplasma contamination and host gene expression in a single cell RNA-<lb/>seq dataset and found 61 host genes (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with mycoplasma-<lb/>mapped read counts. Lastly, to estimate the potential economic cost of this widespread <lb/>contamination, we queried NIH RePORTER to find grants with the terms &quot;cell culture&quot; or &quot;cell <lb/>lines&quot;. Funding for these totaled over $3 billion, suggesting hundreds of millions of dollars in <lb/>research are potentially affected. In all, this study suggests mycoplasma contamination is still <lb/>prevalent today and poses substantial risk to research quality, with considerable financial <lb/>consequences. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Mycoplasmas are small parasitic bacteria of the class mollicutes. There are over 180 <lb/>species infecting a wide range of hosts. Mycoplasmas are common to the human respiratory and <lb/>urogenital tracts (Taylor-Robinson 1996). Some species are pathogenic. For example, M. <lb/>pneumoniae causes atypical pneumonia (Chanock et al. 1962). Also, M. genitalium infection is <lb/>linked to pelvic inflammatory disease (Tully et al. 1981). <lb/>In addition to their impact on human health, mycoplasmas are widespread contaminants <lb/>of cell culture. In 1956, researchers from Johns Hopkins reported mycoplasma contamination of <lb/>HeLa cells used in their lab (Robinson and Wichelhausen 1956). By the early 1990s, the US <lb/>Food and Drug Administration had tested over 20,000 cell cultures and found 15% contaminated <lb/>with mycoplasma (Rottem and Barile 1993). A study in 1991 from Argentina found 70% of the <lb/>200 samples tested were contaminated (Coronato and Coto 1991). More recently, a 2002 report <lb/>by the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) in Germany found <lb/>28% of the 440 cell lines tested (mostly leukemia-lymphoma) were contaminated (Drexler and <lb/>Uphoff 2002). Hence, mycoplasma contamination in cell culture is a long-standing and persistent <lb/>problem. <lb/>Preventing mycoplasma contamination is difficult. For one, mycoplasma cells are small <lb/>(0.3-0.8 uM in diameter) and pleomorphic (Razin 2006), allowing them to pass through standard <lb/>filtration membranes. Secondly, mycoplasmas lack cell walls. This makes them impervious to <lb/>cell culture antibiotics that inhibit cell wall synthesis, such as penicillin. Effective antibiotics do <lb/>exist, however, their continuous use in cell culture is not recommended due to possible <lb/>cytotoxicity. Third, mycoplasmas are able to reach high concentrations in the media of infected <lb/>cells without noticeable turbidity (Young et al. 2010). This makes detection via visual inspection <lb/></body>

			<body>difficult. Lastly, while the primary source of mycoplasma contamination is likely other cell <lb/>cultures, mycoplasmas from lab personnel are a potential source as well (Drexler and Uphoff <lb/>2002). <lb/>Mycoplasmas have one of the smallest prokaryotic genomes (~0.6 Mb). This comes at a <lb/>price, as mycoplasmas lack key genes essential for the synthesis of macromolecule precursors <lb/>and energy metabolism (Razin et al. 1998). As a result, mycoplasmas alter and depend on host <lb/>cell biology for survival (Rottem and Naot 1998; Rottem 2003). For example, M. orale can <lb/>compete for arginine in culture media, impacting host cell growth (Gill and Pan 1970). Also, M. <lb/>hyorhinis endonucleases can degrade host cell DNA, providing DNA precursors for the parasite <lb/>(Paddenberg et al. 1998). Further, mycoplasma infection can dysregulate hundreds of host genes <lb/>(Hopfe et al. 2013). It is therefore imperative that cultured cells are free of mycoplasma <lb/>contamination to ensure the interpretability, reproducibility and reliability of results obtained <lb/>from their use. <lb/>In this study we sought to evaluate the prevalence of mycoplasma contamination in cell <lb/>culture today. High throughput RNA-sequencing data is growing at an exponential rate and is <lb/>providing an unprecedented view of the constituency of RNA molecules in a sample. We posited <lb/>that mycoplasma sequences in RNA-Seq data from primate and rodent specimens would be <lb/>indicative of contamination. Further, because these samples come from hundreds of <lb/>geographically distinct labs, it offers a more comprehensive view of contamination. Hence, we <lb/>surveyed RNA-Seq data from archives at NCBI for mycoplasma sequences. We also evaluated <lb/>the relationship between mycoplasma contamination and host gene expression in a Burkitt&apos;s <lb/>lymphoma cell line. <lb/></body>

			<body>RESULTS <lb/>Acquisition and characterization of RNA-Seq data <lb/>We assessed the feasibility of working with the large volume of sequencing data in <lb/>NCBI&apos;s Sequence Read Archive (SRA). At the time of this study, there were 884 series (or <lb/>projects) of type &quot;expression profiling by high throughput sequencing&quot; or &quot;non-coding RNA <lb/>profiling by high throughput sequencing&quot; from primates and rodents (Supplemental data 1). <lb/>These were comprised of 9395 samples with downloadable sequence files. To make the analysis <lb/>manageable, we downloaded just the first million reads of each of the samples using NCBI&apos;s <lb/>SRA toolkit. For samples with paired-end reads, we assessed only the first read. The resulting <lb/>dataset contained 6.4 billion reads and filled 2TB of disk space. <lb/>Mapping of reads to mycoplasma <lb/>We mapped the reads to mycoplasma in two steps. First, we aligned the reads to four <lb/>complete mycoplasma genomes (M. hominis ATCC 23114, M. hyorhinis MCLD, M. fermentans <lb/>M64 and A. laidlawii PG-8A) with Bowtie (Langmead et al. 2009). Less than 2% (112,547,232) <lb/>of the reads mapped to one or more of the mycoplasma species. This corresponded to 1,280,951 <lb/>unique sequence reads (Supplemental data 2). Next, we eliminated non-specific bowtie aligned <lb/>reads. These were reads that mapped to sequences from other sources as well as or better than <lb/>they did mycoplasma. For example, reads that mapped to the putative host species or to other <lb/>bacteria were eliminated. To accomplish this, we aligned the unique bowtie-mapped reads to <lb/>NCBI&apos;s nucleotide collection (nt) database with standalone BLAST+ (Altschul et al. 1990). The <lb/>nt database is a comprehensive collection of ~20 million DNA sequences from species spanning <lb/>the phylogeny of life and viruses. These sequences include entries from Refseq, GenBank, <lb/>EMBL and DDBJ. Of the 1,280,951 unique bowtie aligned reads, 474,219 (37%) aligned best to <lb/></body>

			<body>mycoplasma as assessed by BLAST E-values (Supplemental Table 1). Ninety percent of all <lb/>BLAST-confirmed reads aligned to ribosomal sequences (Figure 1). <lb/>Mycoplasma contamination in cultured vs non-cultured cells <lb/>Mycoplasma contamination is predominantly found in cultured samples (e.g. cell lines) <lb/>and not in non-cultured samples (e.g. tissues) (Miller et al. 2003). Hence, we posited that non-<lb/>cultured samples in our study would be underrepresented for mycoplasma contamination and <lb/>provide a baseline for the expected number of mycoplasma-mapped reads in a given sample (i.e. <lb/>serve as a negative control). We mined the text of the sample descriptions from NCBI&apos;s Gene <lb/>Expression Omnibus (GEO) for keywords indicating if the samples were cultured or not (see <lb/>Methods). We estimated that 57% of the samples (n = 5328) were cultured and 43% (n = 4067) <lb/>were not (Supplemental Table 2). In series with cultured samples, 11% (52/484) had at least one <lb/>sample with 100 or more reads per million (RPM) that mapped to mycoplasma (see full <lb/>distribution in Figure 2A). In contrast, none of the 344 series with non-cultured samples met this <lb/>criterion (Figure 2A). Further, more samples had reads mapping to M. hyorhinis, than the other <lb/>tested mycoplasma species (Figure 2B, 2C). Fewer samples had reads mapping to A. laidlawii. <lb/>Surprisingly, for 39 samples (all cultured), more than 10 4 RPM (i.e &gt;1% of reads) mapped to one <lb/>or more of the mycoplasma species (Figure 2A, Supplemental Table 2). <lb/>Mycoplasma contamination in poly(A)-vs non-poly(A)-selected samples <lb/>Polyadenylation marks transcripts for degradation in bacteria (Dreyfus and RÃ©gnier 2002, <lb/>9). Hence, we hypothesized that poly(A)-selected samples would be underrepresented for <lb/>mycoplasma contamination. We mined the text of the sample descriptions from NCBI&apos;s GEO for <lb/>keywords indicating if the samples were poly(A)-selected or not (see Methods). We estimated <lb/>that 26% (n = 2431) of the samples were poly(A) selected and 74% (n = 6964) were not <lb/></body>

			<body>(Supplemental Table 2). The latter category was broad and included samples that were depleted <lb/>of ribosomal RNA, size-selected for small RNAs, immunoprecipitated via RNA binding proteins <lb/>and others. Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference in the fraction of series with <lb/>mycoplasma-mapped reads in the poly(A) and non-poly(A) series (Figure 3A). In general, more <lb/>samples had reads mapping to M. hyorhinis than the other mycoplasma species. Fewer samples <lb/>had reads mapping to A. laidlawii (Figure 3B, 3C). <lb/>Effect of mycoplasma contamination on host gene expression <lb/>Next, we wanted to determine the effect of mycoplasma contamination on host gene <lb/>expression. To do this, we searched for series that contained comparable contaminated and non-<lb/>contaminated samples. This was rare as mycoplasma contamination in one sample typically <lb/>guaranteed contamination of all samples of the same cell line/type in the series. Hence, we <lb/>instead focused on contaminated series with large numbers of replicate samples and varied <lb/>amounts of mycoplasma-mapped reads. Our goal was to identify host genes whose expression <lb/>levels were statistically associated with the number of mycoplasma-mapped reads. We found one <lb/>such series (GSE49321) containing seven contaminated samples from the Burkitt&apos;s lymphoma <lb/>cell line DG-75. Interestingly, each sample represented expression data from a single cell. The <lb/>number of mycoplasma-mapped reads ranged from ~10,000 to 36,000 RPM (Figure 4A). We <lb/>downloaded the full RNA-seq datasets for these samples, aligned them to the human reference <lb/>genome using STAR (Dobin et al. 2013), and obtained read counts for genes using HTSeq <lb/>(Anders et al. 2014). We then used DESeq2 (Love et al. 2014) to generate generalized linear <lb/>models of host gene expression as a function of mycoplasma-mapped reads. Sixty-one genes <lb/>were statistically associated with mycoplasma-mapped read counts (Wald test, Benjamini-<lb/>Hochberg adjusted P &lt; 0.001; Supplemental Table 3). We found no significant enrichment in <lb/></body>

			<body>gene annotations using DAVID (Huang et al. 2009). The top 16 genes are shown in Figure 4A. <lb/>Finally, we evaluated the likelihood of obtaining significant genes by chance in our analysis. We <lb/>randomly permuted the gene expression counts of the samples and repeated the analysis 1000 <lb/>times. The number of significant genes was consistently less than that of the observed set for <lb/>various p-value cutoffs examined (P &lt; 0.002, Figure 4B). <lb/>Economic impact of mycoplasma contamination <lb/>To assess the potential financial impact of mycoplasma contamination, we first tallied the <lb/>cost of NIH-funded research involving cultured cells. We queried the NIH Research Portfolio <lb/>Online Reporting tools (RePORT) database for grants from 2013-2014 containing the keywords <lb/>&quot;cell culture&quot; or &quot;cell line&quot;. A total of $3.17 billion in funded grants across the 27 NIH institutes <lb/>and centers contained these terms (Figure 5). Using the contamination rate of 11% from our <lb/>earlier results (Figure 2), we estimated that some portion of approximately $350 million of NIH-<lb/>funded research is potentially affected. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>This study was inspired by a recent incident of mycoplasma contamination in our lab. We <lb/>wondered how often this occurred in other labs. There have been several such surveys over the <lb/>last three decades (Rottem and Barile 1993; Coronato and Coto 1991; Drexler and Uphoff 2002). <lb/>These studies used DNA fluorescent staining or PCR-based methods to detect mycoplasma <lb/>contamination in collected samples. The contamination rates varied from 15% to 70%. Further, a <lb/>recent analysis of DNA sequences from the 1000 Genomes project suggested 7% of the samples <lb/>were contaminated (Langdon 2014). This study represents the first unbiased (and one of the most <lb/>extensive) surveys for mycoplasma contamination. We leveraged publicly available RNA-Seq <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>datasets in GEO to determine the prevalence of contamination today. Importantly, these entries <lb/>were comprised of various sample types under different experimental conditions and originated <lb/>from multiple institutions. We estimated that about 11% of GEO series were contaminated based <lb/>on a cutoff of 100 mycoplasma-mapped RPM in one or more samples. However, this is likely an <lb/>underestimate. For one, in our analysis, we discarded mycoplasma-mapped reads that were not <lb/>unique to mycoplasma. Some of these included reads that mapped to other bacteria and hence <lb/>could not be unambiguously associated with mycoplasma. While they may or may not be <lb/>mycoplasma, they are bacterial. Secondly, Figure 1 suggests that a cutoff of 10 mycoplasma-<lb/>mapped RPM was equally powerful to discriminate between cultured and non-cultured samples. <lb/>At this cutoff, the contamination rate was closer to 15%. Nonetheless, no matter the exact rate, <lb/>our study suggests mycoplasma contamination remains a significant and costly problem. <lb/>We also identified interesting characteristics of mycoplasma contamination in RNA-seq <lb/>data. Notably, we found that the rate of mycoplasma contamination was similar for poly(A)-<lb/>selected and non-poly(A)-selected series (Figure 2). This was unexpected because 1) 90% of the <lb/>mycoplasma-mapped reads mapped to rRNA (Figure 1B) 2) Bacteria transcripts are degraded <lb/>upon polyadenylation (Dreyfus and RÃ©gnier 2002) and 3) the mycoplasma genome lacks <lb/>homologs for polyadenylating enzymes (Sarkar 1996; Portnoy and Schuster 2008). One <lb/>explanation for this result is that the AT-rich mycoplasma genome (~28% GC-content) may <lb/>result in higher susceptibility of transcripts to oligo-dT mediated capture. This is perhaps a <lb/>desirable outcome as contamination in future RNA-Seq experiments may be easily ascertained <lb/>without masking from the enrichment method. <lb/>We mapped sequence reads to four complete mycoplasma genomes: M. hominis, M. <lb/>hyorhinis, M. fermentans, and A. laidlawii. M. hominis and M. fermentans are associated with <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>human diseases; the former, pelvic inflammatory disease, the latter, rheumatoid arthritis <lb/>(Johnson et al. 2000; Taylor-Robinson 2007). M. hyorhinis is commensal in the respiratory tract <lb/>of pigs (Kobisch and Friis 1996). A. laidlawii has a broad host range but is typically found in <lb/>cattle. As such, A. laidlawii was linked to contamination of commercial bovine serum in the <lb/>1970s (Drexler and Uphoff 2002). These four species, along with M. orale and M. arginini, are <lb/>found in 90-95% of mycoplasma contaminated cell lines (Drexler and Uphoff 2002). In our <lb/>study, we found A. laidlawii was least represented in contaminated samples (Figures 2B-C, 3B-<lb/>C). This may be indicative of the reduced likelihood of contamination from bovine serum as <lb/>commercial products are now routinely 0.1 micron sterile-filtered. <lb/>Lastly, we identified 61 genes associated with mycoplasma contamination in a single cell <lb/>RNA-seq dataset. Unfortunately, we could not identify series containing contaminated and non-<lb/>contaminated samples. Therefore, we measured the association between the number of <lb/>mycoplasma-mapped reads per sample and host gene expression in a contaminated series. <lb/>Consequently, directionality of effect could not be determined. That is, differences in the extent <lb/>of mycoplasma contamination may have driven host gene expression or differences in host gene <lb/>expression (especially as it relates to variability of single cells) may have conferred resistance <lb/>(relatively speaking) to contamination or impacted mycoplasma gene expression. It is also <lb/>possible that the associations seen here are not biological per se, but instead indicative of some <lb/>technical artifacts associated with the presence of the AT-rich mycoplasma transcripts in the <lb/>sample. Nonetheless, this is equally problematic as it effects the interpretation of the results. <lb/>Hence, further controlled studies are needed to fully understand the effect of contamination on <lb/>the quality of RNA-Seq data and possibly how to account for this in data analysis. <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>To try to estimate the potential economic cost of this widespread contamination, we <lb/>searched for grants that used the terms &quot;cell culture&quot; or &quot;cell lines&quot; in NIH RePorter. This <lb/>analysis found &gt; $3 billion dollars was invested in this research in 2013-2014. If we assume that <lb/>the contamination rate for our set is the same as the average NIH sponsored lab, this puts some <lb/>portion of ~ $350 million at risk. We are heavy users of cell culture, with approximately 50% of <lb/>our consumables budget going to these experiments. Other labs may be closer to 10%. So <lb/>somewhere between dozens and ~$100m are at risk. Put simply, the economic impact of this <lb/>problem is significant. <lb/>Lastly, our study has broader implications for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing <lb/>data. Too often in our analysis pipelines, we disregard unmapped reads as technical artifacts or <lb/>attribute them to problematic or unsequenced regions of the reference genome. While this may <lb/>be true most of the time, this study suggests such reads warrant further investigation-<lb/>particularly when they constitute a large number of the total reads. We focused on mycoplasma <lb/>in this study as a proof of concept due to its known prevalence. However, the methods used here <lb/>are easily applicable to other known (and unknown) contaminants of cell culture including other <lb/>bacteria, yeast and viruses. <lb/>METHODS <lb/>All Perl scripts used in this study are available as supplemental files. Directions for their use are <lb/>located in the README file. The BLAST analysis was performed through Amazon Web <lb/>Services (8-core, 70GB of RAM).

			<body>GEO series IDs and descriptions for all RNA-seq experiments were obtained through the GEO <lb/>DataSets Advanced Search Builder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/advanced). Results were <lb/> limited on the query parameter &quot;DataSet Type&quot; for &quot;expression profiling by high throughput <lb/>sequencing&quot; and &quot;non coding rna profiling by high throughput sequencing&quot;. The results were <lb/>further filtered to include only primates (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Macaca mulatta, <lb/>Macaca fascicularis, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla) and rodents (Mus musculus, Rattus <lb/>novergicus). SOFT files for all the GEO series were downloaded. From these files, the sample <lb/>IDs were obtained and used to download the corresponding raw sequences using the fastq-dump <lb/>utility of the SRA toolkit (http://eutils.ncbi.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?view=software). <lb/>Identifying poly(A)-selected and cultured samples from sample descriptions <lb/>SOFT files were parsed and searched for keywords under certain headings. For example, poly(A) <lb/>selection was assumed if the library source or extraction protocols contained the keywords <lb/>&quot;polyA&quot; or &quot;oligo-dT&quot; and similar variants. A sample was considered cultured if its description <lb/>contained the keywords &quot;cell line&quot;, &quot;fibroblast&quot;, &quot;MEFs&quot;, &quot;ESC&quot;, &quot;immortalized&quot;, &quot;DMEM&quot;, <lb/>&quot;RPMI&quot;, &quot;Ham&apos;s&quot;, &quot;McCoy&quot;, &quot;cultured&quot;, &quot;passaged&quot;, &quot;propagated&quot;, &quot;grown&quot; and similar <lb/>variants of these keywords. <lb/>Mapping sequence reads to mycoplasma genomes <lb/>The mycoplasma genomes used in this study were downloaded from NCBI genomes: M. <lb/>hominis ATCC 23114 (NC_013511.1), M. hyorhinis MCLD (NC_017519.1), M. fermentans <lb/>M64 (NC_014921.1) and A. laidlawii PG-8A (NC_010163.1). RNA-seq reads were mapped to <lb/>these genomes with Bowtie using the default parameters (Langmead et al. 2009).
