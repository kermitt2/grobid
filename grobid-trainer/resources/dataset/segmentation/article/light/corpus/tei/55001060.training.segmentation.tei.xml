			<body>INTRODUCIION <lb/>&apos;Dan-Shen&apos;, the dried roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, is <lb/>a clinically important Chinese drug in the treatment of <lb/>heart disease. Many chemists have studied the physiologi-<lb/>cally active constituents of this drug and have isolated <lb/>more than 16 orange-red crystalline pigments, abietanoids <lb/>[l, 2 and refs. therein]. Most abietanoids have either a <lb/>furano-ortho-naphthaquinone <lb/>or a furano-para-naphtha-<lb/>quinone skeleton and are classified biogenetically <lb/>as diterpenes. In the course of our search for physiologi-<lb/>cally active substances in Chinese drugs [3 and refs. <lb/>therein], we have isolated five new pigments, tanshindiol <lb/>A (l), tanshindiol B (2), tanshindiol C (3), nortanshinone <lb/>(4) and 3cr-hydroxytanshinone IIA (5), from Dan-Shen as <lb/>minor components. This paper describes the isolation and <lb/>characterization of these pigments. <lb/>Tanshindiols B (2) and C (3) had the same molecular <lb/>formula, ClsH160s (m/z 312 [Ml&apos;), and their spectral <lb/>data were quite similar to each other, indicating that they <lb/>must be stereoisomers. Thus, in addition to each tertiary <lb/>hydroxyl group, 2 had a secondary axial hydroxyl group <lb/>cS3.98 (lH, dd, J = 4.8, 2.9 Hz)] and 3 had a secondary <lb/>equatorial one cS3.96 (lH, dd, J = 4.0, 12 Hz)]. In fact, <lb/>oxidation of either 2 or 3 with sodium periodate gave the <lb/>same product (8). 8 had an acetophenone-type methyl <lb/>ketone moiety c62.61 (3H, s)] and a phenylpropion-<lb/>aldehyde moiety. The presence of the latter moiety <lb/>(Ar-CH&amp;H&amp;HO) <lb/>in 8 was established by the <lb/>&apos;H NMR spectrum with the aid of double resonance <lb/>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <lb/>Repeated column chromatography of the ethanolic <lb/>extract of Dan-Shen on silica gel afforded five new <lb/>abietanoids (l-S), in addition to many known abietanoids <lb/>which are described in the Experimental. <lb/>Tanshindiol A (l), orange-red needles, C1sH1605, gave <lb/>rise to spectra which were similar to those of tanshinone <lb/>IIA (6) [4,5]. However, notable differences between 1 and <lb/>6 were seen with regard to the following points. The <lb/>&apos;H NMR spectrum of 6 had a singlet due to a geminal <lb/>dimethyl group at 61.30 [631.9 (q +q) and 34.9 (s) in the <lb/>13C NMR spectrum (Table l)] and the IR spectrum of 6 <lb/>showed no hydroxyl band. On the other hand, 1 had two <lb/>hydroxyl groups instead of a geminal dimethyl group. <lb/>One of them was a primary alcohol attached to a <lb/>tetrasubstituted carbon ES3.60 (2H, s); m/z 281 [M <lb/>-3 l] &apos;1 and the other was a tertiary alcohol attached to <lb/>the same carbon. This was further confirmed by acety-<lb/>lation of 1 with acetic anhydride-pyridine <lb/>to give the <lb/>corresponding monoacetate (7) [v3500 and 1725 cm-&apos;; <lb/>62.14 (3H, s), and 4.22 (2H, s); 669.6 (t)and 71.4 (s)]. From <lb/>the above results, the structure of tanshindiol A can be <lb/>represented as 1. <lb/>*To whom correspondence sho$d be addressed. <lb/></body>

Irradiation at 62.90 caused, respectively, the <lb/>multiplet at 63.32 and the near singlet at 69.85 to collapse <lb/>to a singlet and a sharp singlet, whereas on irradiation at <lb/>63.32 the multiplet at 62.90 became a near singlet. The <lb/>stereochemistries of the two vicinal hydroxyl groups in 2 <lb/>and 3 were determined on the basis of the following <lb/>chemical evidence. Treatment of 2 with acetone in the <lb/>presence of anhydrous cupric sulphate resulted in the <lb/>recovery of the starting material, but treatment of 3 under <lb/>the same conditions readily afforded the corresponding <lb/>acetonide (9). The structures of tanshindiols B and C can <lb/>therefore be represented as 2 and 3, respectively, including <lb/>the stereochemistries of the two vicinal hydroxyl groups. <lb/>Nortanshinone (4), C,,H,104, <lb/>gave rise to spectra <lb/>similar to those of tanshinone IIA (6). Moreover, 4 had <lb/>one arylic carbonyl group [S 197.3 (s)] instead of a geminal <lb/>dimethyl group in addition to two orthoquinone car-<lb/>bony1 groups [S 175.5 (s) and 182.8 ($1. The location of the <lb/>arylic carbonyl group was assigned by analysis of the <lb/>&apos;H NMR spectrum with the aid of double resonance <lb/>experiments. On irradiation at 62.12, the multiplets at <lb/>6 2.7 1 and 3.46 were changed to sharp singlets. The signal <lb/>at 6 2.12 was changed to a triplet on irradiation at 6 2.71 as <lb/>well as at 3.46. Furthermore, the doublet at 67.96 in 1 was <lb/>shifted to 68.37 in the &apos;H NMR spectrum of 4. This <lb/>downfield shift seemed to be due to the anisotropic effect <lb/>of the carbonyl group. From these results, the structure of <lb/>nortanshinone can be represented as 4. In addition, <lb/>tanshindiol A (1) was subjected to oxidation using sodium <lb/>periodate to afford a carbonyl compound which was <lb/>identical to nortanshinone (4). <lb/>The last pigment, 3a-hydroxytanshinone <lb/>IIA (S), <lb/>CigHlsO,, had a geminal dimethyl group C61.33 (6H, s)] <lb/>and a secondary hydroxyl group [a 3.67 (1 H, m)], which <lb/>was readily acetylated by acetic anhydride-pyridine <lb/>to <lb/>give the corresponding acetate (10) cS2.05 (3H, s) and 5.00 <lb/>(1 H, t, J = 4.9 Hz)]. The presence of the partial structure <lb/>ECH2-CHI-CH-~ <lb/>in 5 was established by the follow-<lb/>ing experiments. On irradiation of 10 at 65.00, the <lb/>multiplet at 62.03 changed to a triplet, and then the <lb/>multiplet at 63.32 as well as that at 65.00 changed to a <lb/>singlet on irradiation at 62.03. Finally, the multiplet at <lb/>62.03 changed to a doublet on irradiation at 63.32. In <lb/>1968, hydroxytanshinone <lb/>II (11) having a secondary <lb/>hydroxyl group at C-l was reported by Kalcisawa et al. <lb/>[S]. The physical data of 5 are clearly different from those <lb/>of 11. Therefore, the hydroxyl group in 5 must be located <lb/>at C-3. This was also confirmed by the &apos;H NMR spectra, <lb/>which showed the signals due to the benzylic methylene <lb/>protons at 63.26 (2H) in 5 and at 63.32 (2H) in 10, <lb/>respectively. From the above results, the structure of 3a-<lb/>hydroxytanshinone IIA can be represented as 5. <lb/>With the exception of 4, we have not established the <lb/>absolute configurations of the new pigments (l-5). <lb/>EXPERIMENTAL <lb/>Mps: uncorr; &apos;H NMR (100 and 60 MHz) and 13C NMR <lb/>(25 MHz): CDCI, unless stated otherwise, TM.9 as internal <lb/>standard, IR: KBr; MS: direct inlet system. <lb/>Extraction and separation. Dan-Shen (ca 120 kg) from the <lb/>Shandong Province (China) was mechanically crushed and <lb/>extracted with hot 95% EtOH.

Each fraction obtained was rechromatographed on <lb/>silica gel using a gradient of CHCI&amp;IezCO to afford five known <lb/>pigments, tanshinone IIA (78 g), tanshinone I (6 g), methylene-<lb/>tanshiquinone (2 g), cryptotanshinone <lb/>(2 g) and dihydro-<lb/>tanshinone I (1 g) as crystals, respectively. The mother liquor of <lb/>tanshinone I from CHCI,-MeOH <lb/>was coned and further <lb/>separated by CC on silica gel using CHCI, containing an <lb/>increasing amount of MezCO to give nortanshinone (4) (101 mg). <lb/>The CeH,-insoluble fraction, which was soluble in a <lb/>mixture of C6Hs-MeOH (9:1), was subjected to dry CC on <lb/>silica gel. The very polar fraction (ca 260g) eluted with <lb/>&amp;H,-MeOH-formamide <lb/>(7: 3 : 0.5) after elution with C6H6 was <lb/>rechromatographed on polyamide powder using 95 y0 EtOH to <lb/>afford a mixture of reddish pigments (120 g).
