A crucial aspect of this task con-<lb/>sists of varying the delay between the Go-and Stop-signal. Since the time necessary to <lb/>administer the task can be long, a method of optimal delay choice was recently proposed: <lb/>the PSI method. In a behavioral experiment, we show a variant of this method, the PSI mar-<lb/>ginal method, to be unable to deal with the Go-response slowing often observed in the Stop-<lb/>signal task. We propose the PSI adjusted method, which is able to deal with this response <lb/>slowing by correcting the estimation process for the current reaction time. In several sets of <lb/>behavioral simulations, as well as another behavioral experiment, we document and com-<lb/>pare the statistical properties of the PSI marginal method, our PSI adjusted method, and the <lb/>traditional staircase method, both when reaction times are constant and when they are line-<lb/>arly increasing. The results show the PSI adjusted method&apos;s performance to be comparable <lb/>to the PSI marginal method in the case of constant Go-response times, and to outperform <lb/>the PSI marginal method as well as the staircase methods when there is response slowing. <lb/>The PSI adjusted method thus offers the possibility of efficient estimation of Stop-signal <lb/>reaction times in the face of response slowing. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Among executive functions, the ability to inhibit and change actions in order to regulate <lb/>impulses and attain long-term goals has a central place. A core experimental method used to <lb/>measure the concept of response inhibition is the Stop-signal task, originally developed by <lb/>Logan and Cowan [1]. In this task, on a majority of trials (Go-trials) a Go-signal is presented, <lb/>to which participants have to respond as quickly as possible, producing the Go-reaction time <lb/>(Go-RT). On a minority of trials (Stop-trials), the Go-signal is followed at some delay (the <lb/>Stop-signal delay, SSD) by a Stop-signal, which instructs the participant to withhold the Go-<lb/></body>

			<body>response. A fundamental result is that withholding the Go-response becomes more difficult <lb/>with longer SSDs [1]. <lb/>An influential model of the Stopping-process in the Stop-signal task is the independent <lb/>horse-race model [1]. The horse-race model assumes that there are two independent processes <lb/>at play during a Stop-trial: the Go-process, which starts with presentation of the Go-signal and <lb/>concludes with a Go-response, and the Stop-process, starting with the presentation of the <lb/>Stop-signal and concluding with the withholding of the Go-response. Both processes race to <lb/>conclusion and whichever finishes first determines the response. Since a longer delay between <lb/>Go-and Stop-signal gives the Stop-process less time to finish, trials with longer SSDs make it <lb/>harder to correctly withhold the Go-response. In a common Stop-signal experiment, a partici-<lb/>pant will manage to withhold the Go-response only on some Stop-trials, but not on others, <lb/>producing an erroneous response. The Go-and Stop-process are thought to be largely inde-<lb/>pendent (for a review, see [2]). <lb/>The horse-race model allows computation of the time the stopping process takes (the Stop-<lb/>signal reaction time, SSRT). The SSRT can be computed by determining the SSD at which the <lb/>likelihood of producing an erroneous Go-response (referred to as p(error)) is 0.5, and then sub-<lb/>tracting that SSD from the mean Go-RT during simple Go-trials. The SSD for which p(error) is <lb/>0.5 is referred to as the critical SSD. To estimate the critical SSD, the staircase tracking proce-<lb/>dure is often used. With this method, a correctly withheld Go-response increases the SSD by a <lb/>certain duration, while an erroneously executed Go-response decreases the SSD by a certain <lb/>amount. In practice, this method usually converges on an SSD at which p(error) is at 0.5, such <lb/>that this SSD can be subtracted from the mean Go-RT (this form of computing the SSRT is <lb/>known as the mean method). Should the method converge at a p different from 0.5, the Go-RTs <lb/>are rank-ordered, and the SSD is subtracted from the nth Go-RT, where n is the total number of <lb/>Go-RTs multiplied by p (the so-called integration method, [2]). An illustration of the horse race <lb/>model&apos;s different quantities can be found in the supplementary material (S1 Fig). <lb/>One disadvantage of the Stop-signal task is its potential length, especially if different condi-<lb/>tions are included, because for every Stop-trial several Go-trials have to be included to make <lb/>the Go-response the prepotent response, and because it takes a relatively large number of <lb/>Stop-trials to reliably estimate the SSRT [3]. As a possible solution to this problem, Livesey and <lb/>Livesey [4] proposed a different method to select an upcoming Stop-trial&apos;s SSD and estimate <lb/>the critical SSD used for computing the SSRT, based on an adaptive Bayesian estimation algo-<lb/>rithm known in the psychophysical literature as the PSI method [5]. <lb/>In the following, our description of the method closely follows the original work of Kontse-<lb/>vich and Tyler [5], which should be consulted for further detail. We present the full algorithm <lb/>here so that changes in its application to the Stop-signal task discussed later in this article will <lb/>be easier to follow. <lb/>In short, the relationship between SSD and the likelihood of a response in a Stop-trial fol-<lb/>lows a psychometric function, such as the Weibull cumulative density function chosen by Live-<lb/>sey and Livesey [4]: <lb/>p successjSSD; Threshold; Slope; ErrorRate <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ <lb/>¼ 1 À 2 � ErrorRate <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ þ 1 À 2 À SSD <lb/>Threshold <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ <lb/>Slope <lb/>� <lb/>� <lb/>þ ErrorRate <lb/>ð1Þ <lb/>pðerrorjSSD; Threshold; Slope; ErrorRateÞ <lb/>¼ 1 À pðsuccessjSSD; Threshold; Slope; ErrorRateÞ <lb/>ð2Þ <lb/>The Threshold parameter governs at which SSD p(error) is 0.5, the Slope determines the rise of <lb/></body>

			<body>the function, and the ErrorRate determines the minimum and maximum the function can take <lb/>on. <lb/>A participant&apos;s performance in the task is described by a vector λ participant = (Threshold participant , <lb/>Slope participant , ErrorRate participant ) in this three-dimensional parameter space. Our knowledge of a <lb/>participant&apos;s performance λ participant at the start of the task is formalized as a probability distri-<lb/>bution p 0 (λ) over the parameter space, which assigns each possible performance vector λ a <lb/>probability p 0 of matching the participant&apos;s performance λ participant . When having no prior <lb/>knowledge, at the outset of the task we can set p 0 (λ) as the uniform distribution. <lb/>Step 1: At the outset of Stop-trial 1, p 0 represents our prior knowledge of the participant&apos;s <lb/>performance. For each SSD and response that is possible in trial 1, we can compute the poste-<lb/>rior probability of each parameter vector λ, according to Bayes&apos; theorem: <lb/>p 0 ljSSD; response <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ ¼ <lb/>p 0 ðlÞ � pðresponsejl; SSDÞ <lb/>P <lb/>l p 0 ðlÞ � pðresponsejl; SSDÞ <lb/>ð3Þ <lb/>where p(response|λ,SSD) is the psychometric function in Eqs 1 and 2. Thus, for each SSD we <lb/>might present in the upcoming trial 1, and for each response the participant might give in <lb/>return, we compute the posterior distribution over the parameter space. <lb/>Step 2: For each of these possible SSD-response combinations we compute the entropy H 0 <lb/>of the resulting posterior distribution p 0 (λ|SSD,response) as: <lb/>H 0 ðSSD; responseÞ ¼ À <lb/>X <lb/>l <lb/>p 0 ðljSSD; responseÞ � logðp 0 ðljSSD; responseÞÞ <lb/>ð4Þ <lb/>The entropy function stems from information theory and quantifies the amount of informa-<lb/>tion necessary to fully specify the state of a system [6]. In the current context, the entropy of <lb/>each posterior distribution quantifies how much information is still needed to completely <lb/>specify which vector λ in parameter space corresponds to our participant&apos;s performance vector <lb/>λ participant . When deciding which SSD to offer on Stop-trial 1, we choose that SSD which yields <lb/>the lowest entropy, and thus the most information about the participant&apos;s performance. <lb/>Step 3: Since the entropy function in Eq 4 is also dependent on the participant&apos;s response, <lb/>we compute the current likelihood of the two possible responses (success, error) for each SSD, <lb/>using the prior probability distribution p 0 (λ) and the psychometric functions in Eqs 1 and 2: <lb/>p 0 ðsuccessjSSDÞ ¼ <lb/>X <lb/>l <lb/>pðsuccessjl; SSDÞ � p 0 ðlÞ <lb/>ð5Þ <lb/>p 0 ðerrorjSSDÞ ¼ <lb/>X <lb/>l <lb/>pðerrorjl; SSDÞ � p 0 ðlÞ <lb/>ð6Þ <lb/>With these, we can compute the expected entropy E[H 0 (SSD)] as <lb/>E½H 0 ðSSDÞ� ¼ H 0 ðSSD; successÞ � p 0 ðsuccessjSSDÞ þ H 0 ðSSD; errorÞ � p 0 ðerrorjSSDÞ ð7Þ <lb/>Step 4: In Stop-trial 1, we present the SSD yielding the lowest expected entropy and record <lb/>the participant&apos;s response. <lb/>Step 5: After having finished trial 1, our updated prior knowledge p 1(λ) is the posterior dis-<lb/>tribution p 0 (λ|SSD,response) from Eq 3 corresponding to the SSD we eventually offered in trial <lb/>1 and the response the participant gave. We now continue with the following trials t = 2, 3 . . . <lb/>n, and on each trial, in order to determine the SSD to offer, steps 1 to 4 are now repeated, <lb/>except that where we used our previous prior distribution p 0 (λ), we now use our updated prior <lb/>distribution p t−1(λ) . <lb/></body>

			<body>Step 6: At the end of the task, after n Stop-trials have been concluded, we derive the parame-<lb/>ter vector most likely to match our participant&apos;s parameter vector λ participant by computing the <lb/>expected value of λ: <lb/>E½l� ¼ <lb/>X <lb/>l <lb/>l � p n ðlÞ <lb/>ð8Þ <lb/>In a number of Stop-signal task simulations and behavioral experiments, Livesey and Livesey <lb/>[4] showed that the PSI method can quickly and accurately estimate the SSRT. In terms of cor-<lb/>relation with the actually simulated SSRT, as well as mean absolute deviation, the PSI method <lb/>was comparable to the traditional staircase. However, the staircase was shown to provide a sys-<lb/>tematically biased estimate of the SSRT, overestimating short SSRTs and underestimating long <lb/>SSRTs, even at more than 30 Stop-trials, while the PSI method arrived at a relatively unbiased <lb/>estimate already after 10 Stop-trials. The PSI method thus promises as a viable alternative to the <lb/>staircase method when quick and unbiased estimation of the SSRT is required. <lb/>The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of Go-response slowing on the PSI <lb/>method. In Livesey and Livesey [4], the Go-RTs in both the simulations and the behavioral <lb/>tasks are constant over the course of the experiment. However, it is known that the Stop-signal <lb/>task can invite a gradual slowing of the Go-RTs over the course of the experiment [7, 8]. There <lb/>is a strategic element to this slowing, since participants will sometimes try to slow their Go-<lb/>responses in order to still catch the Stop-signal. Since this increases the participant&apos;s chance of <lb/>correctly responding, the staircase algorithm will respond to this by further increasing the <lb/>SSD, motivating the participant to further slow the Go-response. In this way, the staircase even <lb/>promotes this strategic slowing. It is an open question how the PSI method can deal with this <lb/>slowing effect in the Stop-signal task. In order to test this, we employ a version of the so-called <lb/>Stop-change task, a variant of the Stop-signal task we have previously found to elicit strong <lb/>Go-response slowing. Previous research has shown the processes involved in stopping and <lb/>changing to be partly overlapping [9-12]. <lb/>In the following behavioral study we implement a slightly modified version of the PSI <lb/>method, the so-called PSI marginal method [13, 14]. In the original PSI method, as used by <lb/>Livesey and Livesey [4], the error rate determining the minimum and maximum p(error) the <lb/>psychometric function can take on is usually fixed. Prins [13] showed that this can lead to a <lb/>biased estimation of the threshold parameter, which is central to estimating the SSRT in the <lb/>Stop-signal task. As a remedy, Prins proposed also adding the error rate-parameter to the <lb/>parameter space, thus estimating three free parameters instead of two. As a further refinement, <lb/>he proposed minimizing the entropy of a posterior distribution that is marginalized over irrel-<lb/>evant parameters (e.g. in the Stop-signal task, minimizing entropy of a posterior that includes <lb/>the threshold parameter but is marginalized over slope and error rate, since these are not rele-<lb/>vant to SSRT estimation). <lb/>In terms of the formulation above, this means changing Eq 4 so as not to compute the <lb/>entropy H 0 (SSD,response) of the full posteriors, but instead to compute: <lb/>H 0À marginal ðSSD; responseÞ ¼ À <lb/>X <lb/>l <lb/>p 0 ðThresholdjSSD; responseÞ � logðp 0 ðThresholdjSSD; responseÞÞ ð9Þ <lb/>where p 0 (Threshold|SSD,response) is the marginalized posterior distribution: <lb/>p 0 ðThreshold ¼ tjSSD; responseÞ ¼ <lb/>X <lb/>s <lb/>X <lb/>e <lb/>p 0 ðThreshold ¼ t; Slope ¼ s; ErrorRate <lb/>¼ ejSSD; responseÞ <lb/>ð10Þ <lb/>Since we implement these recommendations, we will refer to the method we tested as the PSI <lb/></body>

			<body>marginal method from now on, and will refer to the method proposed by Livesey and Livesey <lb/>as the original PSI method. <lb/>Behavioral experiment 1: the PSI marginal method <lb/>Methods <lb/>Participants. Participants were 24 students or former students (M age = 23.8 ± 2.9, 14 <lb/>male, 1 left-handed) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological <lb/>or mental illness. Participants were paid 15 € for their participation and provided written <lb/>informed consent after receiving information about the general aims and risks associated with <lb/>participation as well as their right to withdraw consent at any time. The experiment was <lb/>approved by the ethics committee of the university hospital of the RWTH Aachen and con-<lb/>ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. <lb/>Task. Participants performed a Stop-change task, in which they had to not only inhibit a <lb/>response but also change it to another one. The Go-stimuli were two filled green squares, one <lb/>on the left and one on the right side of the screen, to which participants responded by pressing <lb/>the &apos;f&apos;-and &apos;j&apos;-keys on the keyboard with left and right index fingers simultaneously and as <lb/>quickly as possible. On Change-trials, one of the green squares turned red, indicating that on <lb/>this side, the index finger response should be inhibited and replaced by a middle finger <lb/>response to the &apos;d&apos;-or &apos;k&apos;-key. <lb/>Before each Go-signal, a cue appeared that could give different degrees of information <lb/>about the upcoming trial. The cue consisted of two hollow squares. In the foreknowledge con-<lb/>dition, the cue would indicate on which side the Change-signal could appear (i.e. a green hol-<lb/>low square left and a red hollow square right, indicating a Change-signal might appear on the <lb/>right). The cue was not completely informative, since the upcoming trial might still be a Go-<lb/>trial, but if a Change-signal appeared, it was always on the cued side. In the no-foreknowledge <lb/>condition, both hollow squares were red, such that on both sides a Change-signal might <lb/>appear. The factor foreknowledge [yes, no] was crossed with the factor side [left, right], which <lb/>corresponds to the side on which the Change-signal appeared. Consequently, there were four <lb/>experimental conditions: foreknowledge-left; foreknowledge-right; no-foreknowledge-left; no-<lb/>foreknowledge-right. In addition to these Change-related conditions, another condition was <lb/>included (&quot;certain Go&quot;), which did not include Change-trials. In this condition, the fore-<lb/>knowledge cue consisted of two hollow green squares, indicating that no Change-signal was <lb/>going to appear. <lb/>While these different conditions are usually used to gauge the influence of foreknowledge <lb/>and certainty of the stopping process, they are not relevant to our further discussion of the <lb/>task, which we mainly used because it evokes substantial response slowing. However, a sum-<lb/>mary table of behavioral performance of the different conditions can be found in the supple-<lb/>mentary materials (S1 and S2 Tables). The foreknowledge cue remained on the screen for 1500 <lb/>ms, followed by a 500 ms fixation cross, followed by the Go-stimulus. The Go-stimulus ended <lb/>with the response or after 2500 ms, followed by an 850 ms inter trial interval. The experiment <lb/>was performed using Presentation software (Version 18.0, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., <lb/>Berkeley, CA, www.neurobs.com). <lb/>Procedure. The experiment started with a training run, introducing participants to the <lb/>different conditions of the Stop-change task. Subsequently, participants completed two runs of <lb/>the full task, one with the SSD controlled by the traditional staircase tracking procedure, the <lb/>other controlled by the PSI marginal algorithm. The staircase tracking procedure used a step-<lb/>size of 50 ms, starting at 250 ms and being limited to 50 ms to the low end, and 1200 ms at <lb/>the high end. The PSI marginal method employed a Weibull function as a model for the <lb/></body>

			<body>psychometric function. It considered SSDs ranging from 50 to 1200 ms in steps of 50 ms, and <lb/>considered those same values as possible threshold parameters. The slope parameters consid-<lb/>ered were ranged from 1 to 13 in steps of 1. Error rates considered ranged from 0 to 0.5 in <lb/>steps of 0.05. <lb/>The order of the two blocks was counterbalanced, each run took approximately 30 minutes, <lb/>containing in total 300 trials: for each of the four foreknowledge-side conditions, there were 17 <lb/>Change-trials and 51 Go-trials (25% Change-trials per condition), making 272 trials. Addition-<lb/>ally, there were 28 certain-Go trials. In both runs, after approximately 75 trials, participants <lb/>could take a break. The order of trials was quasi-randomized, with the restrictions that no <lb/>more than 3 Change-trials followed each other, that the first 6 trials of a run were Go-trials, <lb/>and that the first trial after a break was a Go-trial. The trial list in the second run was the <lb/>reverse of the trial list in the first run, with the actual list used for first and second run being <lb/>counterbalanced over participants. Between the two runs, there was a longer break during <lb/>which demographic-and handedness information was collected. <lb/>Comparison: Slowing versus non-slowing. In order to compare the performance of slow-<lb/>ing and non-slowing participants, all participants were grouped based on the PSI method <lb/>block. Participants could show both progressive slowing during the course of the block as well <lb/>as slowed reactions from the outset. To take both kinds of slowing into account during group-<lb/>ing, a plot including all participants&apos; behavior was created, with the slope of Go-RTs through-<lb/>out the block on the x-axis and the Go-RTs&apos; intercept on the y-axis. The two groups were <lb/>created by choosing a separating diagonal resulting in two roughly similarly sized groups. A <lb/>visualization of this grouping can be found in S2 Fig. <lb/>Results <lb/>Experiment 1 was mostly explorative in nature to elucidate the behavior of the PSI marginal <lb/>method in a task involving Go-response slowing. See Fig 1 for an example participant with <lb/>gradual Go-response slowing in the PSI marginal method&apos;s block. Since the maximum SSD <lb/>offered was 1200 ms, the Go-RTs of this participant exceeded this SSD after about half the <lb/>experimental run. In terms of the two methods&apos; response to Go-RT slowing, the behavior illus-<lb/>trated in Fig 1 causes a problem for the PSI method. As can be seen in Fig 2, when Go-RTs <lb/>exceed the maximum threshold considered by the algorithm (at Change-trial 9), the critical <lb/>SSD (equal to the threshold parameter) receiving the highest probability reaches the upper end <lb/>of the parameter space, in this case 1200 ms, and the method is not able to estimate the partici-<lb/>pant&apos;s true critical SSD. In effect, the PSI marginal method is not able to keep up with the slo-<lb/>wed Go-RTs. Notice that the SSRT is ultimately computed with the expected parameter <lb/>combination, not the maximum probability parameters, but nevertheless reaching the bound-<lb/>ary of the parameter space invalidates the method&apos;s SSRT estimates. Furthermore, when the <lb/>mean Go-RT has slowed down considerably, the critical SSD estimated by the method is, after <lb/>a sufficient number of trials, based on this slowed Go-RT. However, when computing the <lb/>SSRT, the mean Go-RT of the entire block is usually used. Thus, the critical SSD subtracted <lb/>from the mean Go-RT might only be based on a slowed subset of Go-RTs toward the end of <lb/>the experimental block. Although we only tested the PSI marginal method, both of these prob-<lb/>lems equally exist for the original PSI method. <lb/>A further consequence arising from response slowing in the Stop-signal task is the overall <lb/>accuracy of the participants. Although the staircase method is designed to converge on an <lb/>accuracy of around 0.5 and can to some degree &quot;follow&quot; the participant&apos;s slowed Go-responses, <lb/>if responses are being slowed down too quickly, they can escape the staircase and allow the par-<lb/>ticipant to attain an accuracy substantially higher than 0.5. This is especially true if the <lb/></body>

			<body>experiment contains multiple conditions and thus, the amount of response slowing between <lb/>the different conditions&apos; interleaved trials is larger. However, an accuracy of around 0.5 is nec-<lb/>essary for an accurate computation of the SSRT. Although the PSI marginal method is not <lb/>explicitly designed to converge at 0.5, it also usually settles around this value. In Fig 3, the pro-<lb/>portion of successful change trials is plotted, averaged over bins of 8 Change-trials, for the two <lb/>different methods and with participants split into two groups, based on whether they showed <lb/>substantial Go-response slowing.

			<body>method for non-slowing participants was able to maintain an accuracy of about 0.5 throughout <lb/>the experiment. Slowing participants were able to achieve a substantially higher accuracy, for <lb/>both the staircase and PSI marginal method. Non-slowing participants for the PSI marginal <lb/>method, on the other hand, stayed below 0.5 performance for the length of the experiment. <lb/>What is striking, furthermore, is that in the PSI marginal method&apos;s block, slowed subjects <lb/>initially achieve a higher accuracy (around 0.5) than non-slowing subjects (0.2). This is owed <lb/>to the extensive parameter range for critical SSDs (50 ms-1200 ms) we used in order to allow <lb/>some response slowing. Before gaining knowledge about a participant&apos;s behavior, the method <lb/>tends to choose SSDs from the center of its parameter range, which in this case is between 600 <lb/>and 650 ms, since these are most informative. These SSDs are already too large for non-slow-<lb/>ing subjects, leading to their poor performance, while slowing subjects are better able to deal <lb/>with these trials. <lb/>We have included further visualization of the relation between SSRT estimates of the stair-<lb/>case-and PSI method in the supplementary material (S3 Fig). <lb/>Since it is clear the PSI marginal method has considerable problems with participants slow-<lb/>ing their Go-responses in the Stop-signal task, we propose the PSI adjusted method, which <lb/>keeps a running estimate of the current mean Go-RT during the experiment. This adjusted <lb/>method does not estimate the critical SSD, but the difference between estimated mean Go-RT <lb/>and the critical SSD, thus in effect estimating SSRT directly. In this way, the method&apos;s esti-<lb/>mated SSRT is always based on the current mean Go-RT, and also does not change substan-<lb/>tially over the course of the experiment, thus not reaching the boundaries of the considered <lb/>parameters. Additionally, even dramatic Go-response slowing should not be able to cause an <lb/>accuracy substantially larger than 0.5. <lb/>Fig 3. Accuracy throughout Experiment 1.

			<body>The PSI adjusted method <lb/>In the following the PSI adjusted method, which can also deal with slowed Go-RTs, will be <lb/>explained in more detail. A participant&apos;s performance is now characterized by a three-dimen-<lb/>sional vector ω = (SSRT participant ,Slope participant ,ErrorRate participant ). Thus, we estimate SSRT <lb/>directly, instead of the threshold parameter. The relation between SSRT and threshold is: <lb/>Threshold ¼ meanGoRT À SSRT <lb/>ð11Þ <lb/>Since the psychometric function is defined in terms of the threshold parameter, we use Eq 11 <lb/>to convert a given SSRT value to its corresponding threshold value. In order to do that, we <lb/>need an estimate of the participant&apos;s mean Go-RT. Since during response slowing, the Go-RT <lb/>changes throughout the task, the first step in each Stop-trial is to estimate the current mean <lb/>Go-RT. This is done via linear regression: over a sliding window including the last several Go-<lb/>trials, the Go-RTs are regressed on their respective trial numbers. The resulting linear regres-<lb/>sion equation is used to predict the Go-RT of the current trial, which serves as an estimate of <lb/>meanGo-RT in Eq 11. <lb/>The logic behind this is that a participant&apos;s SSRT is a characteristic not changing with <lb/>response slowing. The slowing only affects the threshold parameter, which indicates the SSD <lb/>at which p(error) = 0.5. This threshold trails behind the continuously slowing Go-RT, while <lb/>the distance between the Go-RT and the threshold (the SSRT) remains constant. By estimating <lb/>the changing Go-RT and adjusting the threshold parameter for it, we can estimate the <lb/>unchanging SSRT. <lb/>After having estimated the current Go-RT at the outset of the Stop-trial, we also need to <lb/>adjust our SSD range. Until now we have not touched upon the range of SSDs to choose from, <lb/>but since we now adjust for slowing Go-RTs, we have to ensure that the SSDs that can be <lb/>offered in our Stop-trial match the range of threshold values that are possible under our cur-<lb/>rent estimate of the Go-RT and the range of SSRT parameters in our parameter space. On each <lb/>Stop-trial, we let SSDs range from <lb/>meanGoRT À maxðSSRTÞ to meanGoRT À minðSSRTÞ <lb/>where min(SSRT) and max(SSRT) are the minimum and maximum SSRTs of our parameter <lb/>space. In practice, we also truncate negative SSDs to 0. After these adjustments at the start of a <lb/>Stop-trial, the method follows the PSI marginal method outlined earlier, except that all distri-<lb/>butions are now defined over ω parameter space. <lb/>In order to compare the properties of our PSI adjusted method during the Stop-signal task <lb/>to the PSI marginal method as well as the classic staircase method, we ran three sets of simula-<lb/>tions. The first set is very similar to those presented by Livesey &amp; Livesey [4] and investigates <lb/>the qualities of the SSRTs estimated by the different methods under the condition of stationary <lb/>Go-RTs. The second and third set of simulations investigate the effects of Go-RT slowing on <lb/>the different methods. <lb/>Simulations 1: Constant reaction times <lb/>Methods <lb/>Simulations. In order to quantify and compare the performance of our PSI adjusted <lb/>method, the PSI marginal method and the staircase method, we simulated several Stop-signal <lb/>experiments. In each, per trial human performance was simulated by randomly drawing a Go-<lb/>RT from an ex-Gaussian distribution with parameters μ = 360, σ = 40 and ν = 40. These <lb/>parameters remained constant over the experiment. If it was a Go-trial, this was the Go-RT. If <lb/></body>

			<body>it was a Stop-trial, the outcome of the trial was taken to be an erroneous response if the Go-RT <lb/>was smaller than the simulated SSD plus the participant&apos;s SSRT; otherwise it was a successfully <lb/>inhibited trial. In each experiment there was a fixed error rate, which governed how many per-<lb/>cent of trials a participant&apos;s response was inverted, i.e. successful inhibition becoming errone-<lb/>ous response and vice versa. The error rate varied across experiments but was the same for all <lb/>participants. Each experiment contained 100 Stop-trials and 200 Go-trials. In each experiment, <lb/>41 participants were simulated, each with a different SSRT ranging from 50 to 250 in steps of 5 <lb/>ms. In each experiment, three different methods ran in parallel (classic staircase method, the <lb/>PSI marginal method, our PSI adjusted method), each determining on its own which SSD <lb/>should be presented next, and each receiving responses based on separately drawn Go-RTs. <lb/>After each Stop-trial, two Go-trials were simulated, and all participants shared the same Go-<lb/>RT per Go-trial. Three different error rates of 0, 0.05, and 0.1 were simulated, with 50 experi-<lb/>ments per error rate. The performance measures for the four different methods were averaged <lb/>over error rates and experiments. The staircase started at an SSD of 250 ms, was increased or <lb/>reduced by 50 ms after successful or unsuccessful Stop-trials, respectively, and was limited to 0 <lb/>ms at the low end. For the staircase, the SSRT was computed in two ways, once with the mean <lb/>method and once with the integration method. All simulations were programmed using the R <lb/>programming language and environment (R Core Team, 2017). <lb/>In contrast to the behavioral experiment, in the simulations we used a function of the form <lb/>p error <lb/>ð <lb/>Þ ¼ ErrorRate þ <lb/>1 À 2 � ErrorRate <lb/>1 þ e À Slope�ðSSDÀ ThresholdÞ <lb/>ð12Þ <lb/>to model the psychophysical performance. This function follows the form of the logistic func-<lb/>tion but lets the error rate govern both the minimum and maximum the function can take on. <lb/>The PSI marginal method used possible SSDs ranging from 0 to 500 ms in steps of 50 ms. The <lb/>threshold parameters estimated as the critical SSDs ranged from 0 to 500 ms in steps of 5 ms, <lb/>the slope parameters were 0.003, 0.0052, 0.01, 0.019, 0.029 and 0.04, the error rates ranged <lb/>from 0 to 0.3 by steps of 0.05. Our PSI adjusted method estimated SSRTs ranging from -100 to <lb/>400 ms in steps of 5 ms (thus being centered on the actually simulated SSRTs, exceeding them <lb/>by 150 ms to both sides, similar to the PSI marginal method under the stated Go-RT distribu-<lb/>tion parameters). The slope values and error rates were identical to the PSI marginal method. <lb/>SSDs were updated each trial based on the current predicted Go-RT estimate, as described ear-<lb/>lier, ranging from the current predicted Go-RT minus the longest SSRT estimate, until the pre-<lb/>dicted Go-RT minus the shortest SSRT estimate, in steps of 50 ms rounded to the nearest full <lb/>50 ms and set to 0 ms for negative values. The running estimate of the Go-RT was computed <lb/>by linearly regressing the Go-RTs of the last several Go-trials (at least 15, at most 40; covering <lb/>the last 7-20 Stop-trials) on their trial&apos;s number, and then predicting the upcoming Go-RT <lb/>from the linear regression equation. If not enough trials had been passed to make a linear pre-<lb/>diction, a scalar estimate of the Go-RT was used, set at 400 ms. <lb/>Analysis. Per experiment, we computed how the SSRT estimate of each method devel-<lb/>oped over the course of the experiment, so per trial we computed each method&apos;s estimate of <lb/>the SSRT up to that trial, using the Go-RTs obtained up to that trial. For the staircase method, <lb/>SSRTs were computed both according to the mean-and the integration method. We then <lb/>computed three measures of performance for these SSRT estimates, similar to Livesey &amp; Live-<lb/>sey [4]: the correlation of a method&apos;s SSRT estimate with the actually simulated SSRT (over <lb/>participants), the mean absolute deviation of SSRT estimate from the simulated SSRT (aver-<lb/>aged over participants), and the slope of the linear regression line relating the different partici-<lb/>pants&apos; SSRTs to the estimated SSRTs. These parameters, developing over the course of each <lb/>experiment, were then averaged over the different simulated experiments. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>As Fig 4A shows, the correlations between all four methods&apos; SSRT estimates and the true <lb/>SSRTs develop similarly over the course of the experiment, reaching the 0.9 mark around 18 <lb/>trials and further increasing from there. No substantial differences between the methods are <lb/>obvious. <lb/>Fig 4B shows the mean absolute deviation of SSRT estimates for the different methods. <lb/>Again, the time course over the experiment is generally similar for the different methods, with <lb/>only a small underperformance of the PSI methods between trials ten to 25, corresponding to <lb/>a mean absolute deviation of around 2.5 ms after 12 trials. <lb/>The most interesting result is depicted in Fig 4C, where the linear slope between a method&apos;s <lb/>SSRT estimate and the true SSRT is plotted over the course of the experiment. This can be seen <lb/>as an index of biased SSRT estimation, with slopes smaller than one meaning lower SSRTs are <lb/>being overestimated or higher SSRTs being underestimated, or both. An unbiased estimation <lb/>would result in slopes of one. As can be seen, there is a clear ordering of performance for the <lb/>different methods, with the PSI methods performing best and equally well, the staircase inte-<lb/>gration method performing worse and the staircase mean method performing worst. The dif-<lb/>ferences in performance are larger in the lower trial numbers. Since the staircase-and PSI <lb/>methods settle on different ultimate slope values, it will take progressively longer for the stair-<lb/>case methods to reach the same slope values as the PSI methods the closer that value is to one. <lb/>For example, it takes the staircase integration method 4 trials longer than the PSI methods to <lb/>reach a slope of 0.9, but 11 trials longer to reach a slope of 0.95, and 21 trials longer to reach a <lb/>slope of 0.97. <lb/>Simulations 2: Increasing reaction times <lb/>Methods <lb/>In most respects, the second set of simulations is identical the those presented thus far, except <lb/>that now only one error rate was simulated (0.05), and that Go-RTs now slowed down over the <lb/>course of the experiment. Three different extents of slowing were simulated: Go-RTs slowing 5 <lb/>ms per Stop-trial, 10 ms or 15 ms (the first two extents corresponding roughly to the degrees <lb/>of slowing simulated by Verbruggen, Chambers and Logan [3] and the third representing a <lb/>more severe kind of slowing that can be found in experiments containing multiple conditions). <lb/>Slowing was simulated by increasing the μ parameter of the ex-Gaussian distribution used to <lb/>draw Go-RTs from. The results will be presented averaged over the different degrees of slow-<lb/>ing, the results split up for the different amounts of slowing can be found in the supplementary <lb/>materials (S4 Fig). <lb/>Results <lb/>As Fig 5A shows, when Go-responses are slowed over the course of the experiment, the corre-<lb/>lations for the staircase and PSI adjusted method are fairly similar to when responses are not <lb/>being slowed. The PSI marginal method&apos;s performance, however, deteriorates from around <lb/>trial 12 onwards, due to it not being able to react to the slowing Go-responses (and changing <lb/>critical SSDs). Not visible in the graphic, the correlation coefficients for the PSI marginal <lb/>method decrease until 0.2 at trial 100. <lb/>In Fig 5B, it can be seen that the staircase-integration method, the staircase-mean method <lb/>and the PSI marginal method all at some point deteriorate in performance due to not being <lb/>able to keep up with the slowing Go-RTs. The staircase-integration method performs best <lb/>until around trial 30, while the staircase-mean method stops improving at a mean absolute <lb/></body>

			<body>deviation of around 35 ms. While initially performing worse than the staircase-integration <lb/>method, the PSI adjusted method is able to keep up with slowing Go-RTs and steadily decrease <lb/>absolute deviation. The deviations for the staircase-and PSI marginal method eventually <lb/>increase to around 80 and 275 ms, respectively. <lb/>In terms of the slope between estimated and actual SSRTs, the staircase-mean method stays <lb/>consistently below one. The PSI marginal method deteriorates in performance around trial 12. <lb/>Not shown in the graphic, the slope eventually decreases down to almost 0 at trial 100. The <lb/>staircase integration method quickly surpasses a slope of one, again not able to keep up with <lb/>response slowing. The PSI adjusted method quickly rises towards a slope of one and stays <lb/>there for the remainder of the trials. As can be seen in the supplementary materials (S4 Fig), <lb/>the stronger the response slowing, the stronger and earlier the adverse effects on SSRT estima-<lb/>tion occur. <lb/>Generally, while in the case of constant RTs (simulations 1) the PSI methods simply attain a <lb/>given degree of precision in SSRT estimates in fewer trials than the staircase methods, with <lb/>increasing Go-RT slowing it becomes more a question of being able to deal with the slowing at <lb/>all. <lb/>Simulations 3: &quot;Pure&quot; slowing <lb/>Methods <lb/>In simulations 2, we saw that Go-response slowing has a clear detrimental effect on the PSI <lb/>marginal method, which the PSI adjusted method can correct for. However, this leaves open <lb/>the question of whether this decrement in performance results simply from the RTs increasing <lb/>(&quot;pure&quot; slowing), or whether the cause of the problem is the behavior of the participant reach-<lb/>ing and crossing the boundaries of the method&apos;s parameter space, specifically the threshold <lb/>parameter&apos;s boundaries. These two issues are separable, since pure slowing can occur while the <lb/>participant&apos;s behavior is still well within the parameter space, and since a certain degree of <lb/>pure slowing can be accommodated by simply increasing the range of threshold parameters <lb/>available to the PSI marginal method. <lb/>To investigate the effect of pure slowing on the PSI marginal and PSI adjusted methods in <lb/>the absence of reaching the parameter space&apos;s boundaries, we performed an additional set of <lb/>simulations building on simulations 2. <lb/>The simulations were generally identical to simulations 2, again with 3 different degrees of <lb/>response slowing being simulated (5, 10 and 15 ms per Stop-trial), but now for each participant <lb/>only the PSI marginal method and PSI adjusted method ran in parallel. Both methods worked <lb/>as described in simulation 2, except that now, the parameter space of the PSI marginal method <lb/>was changed in a way that until Stop-trial 100, all participants&apos; behavior stayed within the <lb/>parameter space despite the Go-RTs increasing. For example, with a Go-response slowing of 5 <lb/>ms per Stop-trial, after 100 Stop-trials, the mean Go-RT lies at the initial 400 ms + 500 <lb/>ms = 900 ms. Since the critical SSD = Go-RT-SSRT, and since the fastest SSRT simulated was <lb/>50 ms, at the end of the 100 trials the largest critical SSD of the simulated participants lies at <lb/>850 ms. To accommodate for this increase of the critical SSD (and thus, the increasing thresh-<lb/>old parameter of the PSI marginal method), we set the threshold parameter space of the PSI <lb/>Fig 4.

			<body>marginal method to range from 0 to 1000 ms (in steps of 5 ms). Since the smallest critical SSD <lb/>at the start of the task lies at 400 ms-250 ms = 150 ms, the 0 ms lower end of the parameter <lb/>space leaves a buffer of 150 ms. Similarly, the 1000 ms upper end exceeds the largest critical <lb/>SSD at the end of the experiment by 150 ms. This principle was adhered to by all three simu-<lb/>lated degrees of response slowing. Thus, for a slowing of 10 ms per Stop-trial, the threshold <lb/>parameter space for the PSI marginal method ranged from 0 to 1500 ms in steps of 5 ms, while <lb/>for a slowing of 15 ms per Stop-trial, the PSI marginal method&apos;s parameter space ranged from <lb/>0 to 2000 ms in steps of 5 ms. The possible SSDs always spanned the same range in steps of 50 <lb/>ms. The PSI adjusted method did not need an adjusted parameter space. <lb/>To also see the effect of crossing the parameter space&apos;s boundaries, the tasks were simulated <lb/>further than the initial 100 Stop-trials, until the point when all participants had left the PSI <lb/>marginal method&apos;s parameter space. For 5 ms of slowing per Stop-trial, this resulted in 170 <lb/>simulated trials. For 10 and 15 ms of slowing, 135 and 124 trials were simulated respectively. <lb/>Results <lb/>The results can be seen in Figs 6-8. Correlations, mean absolute deviations and linear slopes <lb/>were computed as for simulations 1 and 2. To compare the performance of the two methods to <lb/>the case of no Go-response slowing, we also show the results of simulation 1 again (in black), <lb/>in which Go-RTs were constant. <lb/>As can be seen in Fig 6, the effects of Go-RT slowing on the PSI marginal method&apos;s perfor-<lb/>mance are already apparent before the boundaries of the parameter space are reached (trial 1 <lb/>to 100): the stronger the response slowing, the lower the correlation between simulated and <lb/>estimated SSRTs (Fig 6A), ranging from around 0.9 between trials 25 and 75 for 5 ms slowing, <lb/>to around 0.75 for 15 ms of slowing. When the boundaries of the parameter space are reached <lb/>(and crossed; after the red line), correlation coefficients start to decrease more strongly. <lb/>The same effect of response slowing is apparent for mean absolute deviation (B) between <lb/>simulated and estimated SSRTs: the stronger Go-RT slowing, the larger the deviation becomes, <lb/>even before reaching the parameter space&apos;s boundaries. At trial 100, when the end of parame-<lb/>ter space is reached, the mean absolute deviation for 5 ms of slowing lies at around 100 ms; for <lb/>10 ms, it lies at around 430 ms; for 15 ms, it lies just below 700 ms. Not shown here, the results <lb/>also indicate that the increased absolute deviation during the first 100 trials is mainly due to <lb/>incorrect estimation of the Go-RT and only to a lesser extent the result of erroneous estimation <lb/>of the critical SSD. <lb/>In the linear slopes between simulated and estimated SSRTs (Fig 6C), the pattern is not so <lb/>clear while participants remain inside parameter space: while slopes seem to slightly oscillate <lb/>around 1, especially for stronger response slowing, the marked deterioration of performance <lb/>for the PSI marginal method only begins after the threshold parameter space was left, with <lb/>slopes sharply declining. <lb/>As visible in Fig 7, the PSI adjusted method is able deal with response slowing both when <lb/>participants remain inside the parameter space as well as when they leave parameter space. In <lb/>mean absolute deviation as well as linear slopes, some gradation is visible, with stronger <lb/>response slowing leading the decreased performance (insets), but the size of these effects is not <lb/>comparable to the PSI marginal method&apos;s deterioration of performance. <lb/>Fig 5.

			<body>In Fig 8, we show the entropy of the PSI marginal method&apos;s posterior distributions over the <lb/>course of the simulated experiments, separately for 5, 10 and 15 ms response slowing per Stop-<lb/>trial. Furthermore, for each degree of response slowing, we separately show the entropy for <lb/>threshold parameter (summed over slope and error rate), slope (summed over threshold and <lb/>error rate) as well as error rate (summed over threshold and slope parameters). The parameter <lb/>dominating the overall entropy, which can be envisioned as the sum of all three entropies, is <lb/>the threshold parameter. It is clear that after a short drop in entropy for the threshold parame-<lb/>ter (until trial 25 for 5 ms), the value increases gradually until trial 100. Starting at trial 100, <lb/>when the boundaries of the parameter space are hit, overall entropy decreases again, which is <lb/>largely driven by the threshold parameter. This shows that while response slowing leads to an <lb/>increase in entropy when the parameter space has not been left yet, especially for the threshold <lb/>parameter, the event of hitting the boundaries of parameter space and leaving it leads to <lb/>decreased entropy, most likely due to the probabilities of the posterior distributions concen-<lb/>trating at the outer edges of parameter space. <lb/>Behavioral experiment 2: The PSI adjusted method <lb/>As the results of Experiment 1 showed, the presence of strong response slowing caused differ-<lb/>ent problems for the PSI marginal method. After finding a good performance of the PSI <lb/>adjusted method in the simulations, we wanted to put the method to the test in human partici-<lb/>pants and see whether these problems persisted. As in Experiment 1, a group of participants <lb/>completed two blocks of the Stop-change task, one with SSDs controlled by the staircase <lb/>method, and one controlled by the PSI adjusted method described above. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Participants. Participants were 20 students or former students (M age = 23.4 ± 3.2, 6 male, <lb/>3 left-handed) from the same population as Experiment 1, with normal or corrected-to-normal <lb/>vision and no history of neurological or mental illness. Participants were paid 15 € for their <lb/>participation. Informed consent procedures were the same as in Experiment 1, the local ethics <lb/>committee of the university hospital of the RWTH Aachen had approved the experiment. <lb/>Task. Participants completed the same Stop-change task described in Experiment 1. <lb/>Procedure. Again, participants started with a training run, followed by two consecutive <lb/>runs of the Stop-change task, one controlled by the staircase procedure and one controlled by <lb/>the PSI adjusted method. The settings for the staircase procedure were generally identical to <lb/>Experiment 1, with the lowest SSD now 0 ms and the largest SSD now 2300. The largest SSD <lb/>was increased since the PSI adjusted method now also allowed for further response slowing <lb/>compared to Experiment 1. The PSI adjusted method used the same psychometric function as <lb/>described for the simulations. The SSRTs considered as parameters ranged from 0 to 600 ms <lb/>in 24 equally sized steps, rounded to the nearest millisecond. The slope parameters considered <lb/>were 0.003, 0.0052, 0.01, 0.019, 0.029 and 0.04, and the error rates considered ranged from 0 to <lb/>0.5 in steps of 0.05. The possible SSDs were updated each trial as described above, and the cur-<lb/>rent predicted Go-RT was estimated based on the last 15 to 40 Go-trials. Less than 40 trials <lb/>were usually used at the beginning of the task, when not enough Go-RTs had been collected <lb/>Fig 6.

			<body>yet. The certain-Go condition was excluded from Go-RT prediction, since Go-RTs in this con-<lb/>dition are known to differ from those in the change-conditions. Although the possible SSDs <lb/>computed in this fashion can increase indefinitely, they were capped at 2300 ms. At the begin-<lb/>ning of the PSI method&apos;s run, the Go-RTs from the preceding block, either training or stair-<lb/>case, were used to initially predict Go-RT. <lb/>All other procedures were kept identical to Experiment 1. <lb/>SSRT computation. For the staircase block, SSRTs were computed using the integration <lb/>method, with all Change-trials containing erroneous responses considered signal-respond tri-<lb/>als. For the PSI adjusted method, SSRTs were estimated directly, and thus the expected SSRT <lb/>was derived from the ultimate posterior distribution. <lb/>Results <lb/>We present the results of Experiment 2 in a similar manner to Experiment 1. Figs 9 and 10 are <lb/>taken from a participant showing Go-response slowing similar to the example participant <lb/>from Experiment 1 (Figs 1 and 2). Even though there is considerable slowing, the SSRT esti-<lb/>mate of the PSI adjusted method is fairly stable across change trials, allowing the method to <lb/>optimally sample SSDs despite Go-responses being slowed. <lb/>Fig 11 compares the PSI marginal and PSI adjusted method with respect to their parameter <lb/>estimates over the course of the experiment. For the PSI marginal method (Experiment 1), <lb/>there is a considerable number of participants, specifically those slowing their Go-responses, <lb/>for which the threshold parameter receiving the highest probability in the posterior distribu-<lb/>tion reaches the method&apos;s upper boundary, thus limiting the method&apos;s ability to estimate the <lb/>true SSRT. Furthermore, a smaller number of participants reach the lower boundary of the PSI <lb/>marginal method&apos;s parameter space. These are participants showing particularly fast Go-<lb/>responses. <lb/>While for the PSI marginal method strong response slowing causes a parameter drift <lb/>toward the upper boundary, in the PSI adjusted method the maximum probability parameters <lb/>are visibly more stable over time, both for slowing and non-slowing participants. There is, <lb/>however, a small number of participants in the slowing group whose parameter estimates in <lb/>the PSI adjusted method drift toward the lower end of the parameter space. There thus appears <lb/>to be some residual influence of response slowing on parameter estimation. Importantly, this <lb/>problem is far less pronounced than in the PSI marginal method used in Experiment 1. We <lb/>come back to the reasons behind this effect in the discussion. <lb/>Another problem we noted for the PSI marginal method and staircase in Experiment 1 was <lb/>that for slowing participants, accuracy levels substantially deviated from 0.5. As Fig 12 shows, <lb/>the PSI adjusted method is successful at maintaining accuracy at roughly 0.5 throughout the <lb/>experiment, for both slowing and non-slowing participants. As in Experiment 1, the staircase <lb/>method is only able to maintain this intended accuracy level for non-slowing participants. <lb/>As for experiment 1, we included further results on the relation between SSRT estimates of <lb/>the staircase-and PSI method in the supplementary material (S5 Fig). <lb/>A further question relevant to the PSI adjusted method is how many trials are optimal <lb/>when estimating Go-RTs through linear regression. While the up-to 40 trial long window used <lb/>by us to predict current mean Go-RT appears to have worked fine, we present additional anal-<lb/>ysis of Go-RTs in supplementary S6 Fig, in which mean and standard deviation of the residuals <lb/>of the RT prediction are shown, as a function of different window sizes. While the variability <lb/>Fig 7. PSI adjusted method&apos;s performance for different degrees of slowing inside parameter space.

			<body>of residuals reaches a stable minimum with window sizes larger than 10 to 15 trials for both <lb/>slowing and non-slowing subjects, the mean residual stays between -1 and 1 ms roughly <lb/>between window sizes of 1 and 30 trials. Thus, according to our behavioral data, window sizes <lb/>over 10 to 15 trials, but not substantially larger than 30 trials, are recommended. It should be <lb/>noted that the optimal window size depends on the timescale and form of changes in RTs, <lb/>which in turn likely depend on the specific task, such that other numbers of trials might be bet-<lb/>ter suited to predict Go-RT in different tasks. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>The original PSI method for the Stop-signal task [4] was proposed to allow optimal sampling <lb/>of SSDs in Stop-trials, thus allowing shorter experimental lengths. In this article, we showed <lb/>that the PSI marginal method, and by implication the original PSI method, cannot adequately <lb/>deal with the kind of response slowing often found in Stop-signal tasks. We proposed a PSI <lb/>adjusted method that continuously estimates Go-RTs and adjusts for possible slowing, thereby <lb/>allowing optimal sampling of SSDs despite slowing. In three sets of Stop-signal task simula-<lb/>tions, we compared the performance of this adjusted method to the PSI marginal method as <lb/>well as the classic staircase method. Furthermore, we tested how the PSI adjusted method fares <lb/>when employed with human participants showing strong Go-response slowing. <lb/>From the simulation results, it is clear that when there is no response slowing, the PSI meth-<lb/>ods offer improved performance in estimating SSRTs, especially for small trial numbers and <lb/>Fig 8. Marginal entropy of the PSI marginal method over the course of the task. The marginal entropies of the <lb/>threshold, slope and error rate parameters are shown, over the course of the task, for the PSI marginal method.

			<body>when unbiased estimation of the spectrum of SSRTs is important. In the face of response slow-<lb/>ing, as is common in Stop-signal tasks, it is crucial to correct the PSI method for the changing <lb/>response speed. When this is achieved, as in our proposed PSI adjusted method, this method <lb/>can offer improved performance over the staircase method even under considerable response <lb/>slowing. <lb/>Another interesting result most clearly visible in Fig 4 is that the traditional staircase com-<lb/>bined with the mean method is considerably worse for estimating SSRTs at low trial numbers <lb/>than when combined with the integration method. This performance decrement is visible <lb/>when inspecting the slope between simulated and estimated SSRTs, showing that either <lb/>smaller SSRTs are overestimated or larger SSRTs are underestimated. The cause of this behav-<lb/>ior is that when using the mean method, it is assumed that the SSDs offered up to this point <lb/>correspond to a performance of 0.5. However, since the staircase takes a certain time to reach <lb/>that performance level, the SSDs subtracted from the mean Go-RT will introduce a certain <lb/>bias, which varies depending on the true SSRT of the participant. With the integration method, <lb/>on the other hand, this bias is corrected for by using not the mean Go-RT, but a percentile of <lb/>the RT distribution that corresponds to the participant&apos;s behavior. <lb/>A further benefit of the PSI methods not discussed so far is that for every point during the <lb/>experiment, they provide a likelihood distribution over the parameters underlying the partici-<lb/>pant&apos;s performance, and thus a likelihood distribution over the SSRT estimate at that point. <lb/>This allows computing a confidence interval of sorts around the updated SSRT estimate after <lb/>every Stop-trial (similar to the illustration of SSRT estimation in Fig 7). This opens up interest-<lb/>ing new experimental opportunities, such as only running a Stop-signal task until a certain <lb/>level of confidence in SSRT has been reached, or dynamically controlling stimulus presenta-<lb/>tion based on the SSRTs that are likely or unlikely for a participant. <lb/>As shown in the results section of Experiment 2, there appears to be a residual effect of Go-<lb/>response slowing on SSRT estimation even for the PSI adjusted method. This is likely the result <lb/>of less than optimal estimation of Go-RTs for this method, particularly an underestimation of <lb/>Go-RTs. The mechanism behind this is the following: when participants have longer Go-RTs <lb/>than estimated by the method, they are capable of still stopping for SSDs that would be too <lb/>long under their actual SSRT, thus leading to a reduced estimated SSRT. Since the PSI adjusted <lb/>method presented here predicts Go-RTs by linearly regressing previous RTs on trial number, <lb/>Fig 10. Likelihood estimates during Experiment 2. As Fig 2, the PSI adjusted method&apos;s posterior distribution for the example participant. Colors indicate probability <lb/>of the parameter combinations, the error rate dimension was averaged over. Despite considerable Go-response slowing, the parameters receiving the highest <lb/>probability do not reach the upper boundaries of the parameter space. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210065.g010 <lb/></body>

			<body>it is clear that any kind of non-linear change in response times cannot be accommodated. Fur-<lb/>thermore, the PSI adjusted method only predicts mean Go-RTs, thereby ignoring other prop-<lb/>erties of the Go-RT distribution, such as variance and skewness, which would be taken into <lb/>account under the ex-Gaussian parameterization of the RT distribution. As a future improve-<lb/>ment to the method, more flexible and behaviorally realistic models of response slowing could <lb/>be used to better capture changes in RTs throughout the experiment. It stands to reason that <lb/>this would further improve the statistical properties of the PSI adjusted method. <lb/>S3 and S5 Figs show the relationship between the SSRT estimates of the staircase blocks and <lb/>the PSI method&apos;s blocks, separately for 1 and 2. While the number of data points <lb/>is not very large, it is clear that the correlations between estimates from the staircase method <lb/>and the PSI methods are far from perfect. This is likely caused by response slowing, since the <lb/>correlation coefficients are larger in the non-slowing groups, both for Experiment 1 and 2. In <lb/>these groups, the adjusted PSI method produces SSRT estimates more in line with the staircase <lb/>method than the PSI marginal method does. It is an open question to which degree the correla-<lb/>tion-diminishing effects of response slowing are stemming from the PSI methods&apos; SSRT esti-<lb/>mates or the staircase method&apos;s estimates. Both the PSI methods and the staircase method <lb/>Fig 11. Parameter estimates for Experiment 1 and 2.

			<body>might contribute to this deviation of estimates: the PSI marginal method does not take into <lb/>account response slowing, and the adjusted PSI method&apos;s estimate of Go-RTs might be <lb/>suboptimal, while the staircase method might just as well not be able to deal effectively with <lb/>Go-RT slowing. Future research might elucidate the source of these incongruencies in SSRT <lb/>estimates. <lb/>While the method of optimal RT estimation is of technical relevance, there is also the more <lb/>theoretical question of whether Go-response slowing invalidates the Stop-signal and related <lb/>tasks. Indeed, it has often been pointed out that the independent horse race model underlying <lb/>the analysis of behavior in this task assumes independence between the Go-process driving the <lb/>Go-response and the Stop-process responsible for inhibiting this response. Since Go-response <lb/>slowing in this task is generally related to the presence and prevalence of Stop-trials [15], this <lb/>might call into question the validity of Stop-signal tasks that provoke considerable response <lb/>slowing. We think these tasks are nevertheless important precisely because of this slowing. <lb/>While the mathematical independent horse race model understands the Go-and Stop-pro-<lb/>cess as independent, it has been noted that pure independence can be paradoxical when <lb/>addressing the instantiation of response stopping in the brain [16]. After all, the Stop-process <lb/>must exert some form of influence over the Go-process in order to prevent its execution. Inter-<lb/>estingly, Boucher et al. [17] showed that effects explained by the independent horse race model <lb/>can be captured in an interactive horse race model where Go-and Stop-process do interact in <lb/>a delayed and pronounced manner. We think that when discarding Go-response slowing sim-<lb/>ply as a nuisance when estimating SSRT, one is discarding a property inherent in the very neu-<lb/>ral inhibition system that is being studied. In this point we agree with other authors who have <lb/>made Go-response slowing in Stop-signal tasks an explicit subject of experimental investiga-<lb/>tion [15, 18-20]. In this area of research, response slowing in the context of Stop-signals has <lb/>often been taken as an indicator of proactive inhibition, and some results suggest that the <lb/>Fig 12.

			<body>neural processes involved in reactive response inhibition are also partly involved in proactive <lb/>inhibition and can be indexed by response slowing [19, 21]. Indeed, quantifying not just reac-<lb/>tive but also proactive inhibition in the same task has been useful in analyzing neural data and <lb/>providing a more complete picture of the inhibition system [21, 22]. <lb/>This is not to say, of course, that response slowing cannot be an obstacle to correct estima-<lb/>tion of SSRT, as has been shown previously [3]. If precise estimation of only SSRT is para-<lb/>mount, experimental methods of preventing slowing can be crucial, such as giving participants <lb/>feedback on their RTs. However, we think that in order to investigate the entire response inhi-<lb/>bition system, Go-RT slowing must also be accounted for, which necessitates methods of SSRT <lb/>estimation in the presence of slowed Go-responses. <lb/>A criticism that could be levelled against our behavioral experiments is that we used a non-<lb/>traditional Stop-task, namely the Stop-change task, and included different conditions, which <lb/>simulation studies usually do not. However, as described earlier, the processes involved in <lb/>changing a response to another one have been found to partly overlap those of outright stop-<lb/>ping a response [9-12]. Furthermore, while simulation studies often do not acknowledge dif-<lb/>ferent experimental conditions for lack of a clear way of simulating them, many behavioral <lb/>experiments do include multiple conditions. Since this can increase the amount of response <lb/>slowing per Stop-trial, it is important to consider the influence this has on estimating SSRTs. <lb/>We have presented behavioral as well as simulation data showing that the PSI marginal <lb/>method and even the traditional staircase method in the Stop-signal task have problems <lb/>accommodating excessive Go-response slowing. Consequently, we proposed an extension of <lb/>the PSI method that accommodates this often observed behavior. Our results show this PSI <lb/>adjusted method to be an advantageous alternative to previous methods of SSD choice espe-<lb/>cially when the number of Stop-trials that can be presented is limited. <lb/></body>
