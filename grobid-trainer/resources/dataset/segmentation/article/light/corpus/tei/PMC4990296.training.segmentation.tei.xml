			<body>Introduction <lb/>The microblogging social media platform, Twitter, enjoys increasing popularity in the health-<lb/>care sector. Currently, over 70% of urologists in Australia and New Zealand have a social <lb/>media presence, with Twitter being the second most commonly used form after LinkedIn, <lb/>which serves a completely different purpose [1]. Urologists using Twitter during the European <lb/>Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) congresses <lb/>regarded it as beneficial for professional networking, disseminating information, research, <lb/>advocacy, and career development [2]. Impressively, 1,860 users generated 15,419 tweets in <lb/>total at the EAU14 and AUA14 congresses [3]. Notably, the Twitter-based International Urol-<lb/>ogy Journal Club, #urojc, has established a high-level academic discussion of urologic manu-<lb/>scripts [4]. In attempt to standardise the online discussion about urological care, a particular <lb/>structuring of the key urology-related hashtags has recently been proposed [5]. Interestingly, <lb/>the high technology field of endourology was the first urologic subspeciality assessed for Twit-<lb/>ter activity during the 2013 World Congress of Endourology [6]. Most recently, a Twitter dis-<lb/>cussion during the Third Meeting of the European Association of Urology Section of <lb/>Urolithiasis 2015 comprised 94 users contributing 446 tweets [7]. <lb/>In slightly more than a decade, the prevalence of urolithiasis in the United States has <lb/>increased from 5.2% to 8.8% [8], having a substantial socioeconomic impact [9] and incre-<lb/>mentally affecting younger patients [10]. Since evidence has been provided for both highly <lb/>prevalent urologic conditions and also diseases with young patient age at onset evoking more <lb/>Twitter activity than their counterparts [11], a vibrant Twitter discussion on stone disease is <lb/>likely. Interestingly, in conditions with broad-based Twitter communities, such as breast can-<lb/>cer, patients have reported an increase in disease knowledge from participating in Twitter dis-<lb/>cussions [12]. <lb/>In the current investigation, we aimed to assess the potential of Twitter to constitute a <lb/>potential platform for the dissemination of contemporary evidence on prevention, diagnosis <lb/>and treatment of stone disease. Hypothesising that a Twitter discussion on #KidneyStones <lb/>might appreciably involve both healthcare givers and laypeople, as well as encourage consider-<lb/>able global public awareness, we investigated the characteristics of its activity, users and <lb/>content. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of the Faculty of Medicine of the University <lb/>of Cologne. We performed an extensive analysis of activity, users and content of the online dis-<lb/>cussion on #KidneyStones on Twitter, using the Symplur Signals database. Symplur (www. <lb/>symplur.com) is a Twitter analysis website that maintains a database of healthcare-related <lb/>Twitter conversations. Symplur Signals (www.symplur.com/signals) is a fee-based research <lb/>analytics tool that promotes the understanding of healthcare as seen by patients, doctors and <lb/>other stakeholders with access to healthcare social media data points. <lb/></body>

			<body>In October 2015, we searched the Symplur Signals database for analytic insights into the <lb/>online discussion on #KidneyStones for the time period 1st October 2014 to 1st October 2015. <lb/>The activity analysis comprised the assessment of overall tweet activity, tweet metrics, engage-<lb/>ment metrics and tweet language metrics. Overall tweet activity was recorded as the number of <lb/>tweets and users, and these were related to time periods. We performed a detailed analysis of <lb/>the tweet transcript (exact list of all tweets) to assess the issues inducing peak activities. The <lb/>tweet metrics analysis was performed by retrieving statistics about ratio and frequency of <lb/>retweets, tweets with links, tweets with photos, tweet replies and tweets where one or more <lb/>Twitter users were mentioned. Engagement metrics were retrieved by obtaining the number of <lb/>users who tweeted over a set period of time, grouped by the number of tweets sent. A tweet lan-<lb/>guage analysis illustrated the language used by active participants over a set period of time. <lb/>Language type was identified by a natural language processing algorithm directly provided by <lb/>the Twitter application programming interface. <lb/>User analysis included the cumulative user report, users&apos; geolocations, and an influencer <lb/>analysis of the top influencers in the #KidneyStones discussion. Cumulative and new users <lb/>were recorded for monthly intervals. Cumulative users did not represent recurring users, but <lb/>were counted as a new user the first time they used the #KidneyStones hashtag and as a previ-<lb/>ous user in subsequent reporting periods, regardless of activity. The geolocation of users was <lb/>recorded when users sent tweets tagged with certain geolocation data. We analysed the top 100 <lb/>contributors to the #KidneyStones discussion, as measured by number of tweets in the influen-<lb/>cer analysis. For this purpose, we performed a Twitter profile analysis and assigned these top <lb/>influencers to these healthcare categories, in line with the Symplur Signals healthcare category <lb/>definitions: physician; patient; healthcare professional; caregiver/advocate; researcher/aca-<lb/>demic; individual other healthcare; individual other non-healthcare; organisation provider; <lb/>organisation research/academic; organisation government; organisation advocate/support; <lb/>organisation pharma; organisation other healthcare; organisation other non-healthcare, and <lb/>spam [13]. <lb/>We used the Symplur Signals tools for content analysis. The 100 most frequently used <lb/>words in tweets on #KidneyStones were analysed and counted. Since multiple hashtags are <lb/>often used within a single tweet, we used the hashtag network graph to analyse hashtags accom-<lb/>panying the #KidneyStones discussion and their relationships. The sentiment report analysed <lb/>tweets for positive and negative sentiment by a natural language processing algorithm. The <lb/>algorithm is based on two custom dictionaries, one for positive words and one for negative <lb/>words. Each word in the dictionaries has a weighting from one to five, with five being the high-<lb/>est. Finally, we investigated the most frequently shared links, photos and the most frequently <lb/>retweeted tweets. We performed statistical calculations using the Statistical Package for the <lb/>Social Sciences 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Values are described as median <lb/>and range. <lb/>Results <lb/>Table 1 shows overall activity for the #KidneyStones online discussion on Twitter for the time <lb/>period of one year. 3,426 users produced 10,806 tweets. Fig 1 portrays the weekly number of <lb/>tweets on #KidneyStones, which slightly increased over the investigated time period. The peak <lb/>tweet activity occurred during a strategic massive tweet activity of key influencers, evoking a <lb/>large amount of retweets (influencers: @virtualclinicng, 9th March 2015 and 11th March 2015, <lb/>41 tweets on kidney stones prevention leading to a peak of over 500 tweets in a week; @mayo-<lb/>clinic, 11th July 2015, 41 tweets on kidney stones prevention during a radio show leading to a <lb/>peak of over 400 tweets in a week). <lb/></body>

			<body>Out of 10,333 total tweets, 5,013 (49%) were accompanied by links, 3,101 (30%) by men-<lb/>tions and 1,337 (13%) by photos. 2,441 (24%) were retweets and 229 (2%) were tweet replies. <lb/>2,798 users (82%) generated one tweet, 331 (10%) two, 244 (7%) three to nine, and 53 (2%) 10 <lb/>or more tweets. 9,942 (96%) of tweets were in the English language. <lb/>Fig 2 demonstrates that the monthly number of users contributing to the #KidneyStones <lb/>online discussion on Twitter from October 2014 grew steadily, with a median of 262 (range <lb/>189-454) new users per month. The median number of active users contributing to the #Kid-<lb/>neyStones online discussion was 304.5 per month (range 227-545).

			<body>&apos;pain&apos; (1,233), &apos;urine&apos; (1,158), and &apos;risk&apos; (1,023) were the top words. The S2 Table presents the <lb/>complete content analysis with the 100 most frequently used words in #KidneyStones tweets. <lb/>The largest thematic proportion of tweets focused on disease awareness and prevention (35 of <lb/>words). The sentiment analysis revealed that 56% of the tweets had a positive sentiment <lb/>and 44% had a negative sentiment. The median (range) number of shares for the top 10 links <lb/>was 85 (62-587) and 45.5 (17-94) for the top 10 photos. The top 10 retweets had a median of <lb/>44 (22-95) retweets. The #KidneyStones hashtag was often related to the #health, #renalcolic, <lb/>#renalcalculus and #kidney hashtags. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>We performed a longitudinal assessment of activity, users and content of the online discussion <lb/>on #KidneyStones, using the Symplur Signals health analytics database. Over the one year <lb/>period, Twitter activity was reflected by 10,806 tweets, which were frequently enhanced with <lb/>links and mentions, and were posted predominantly in English. Together, 3,426 users from 106 <lb/>countries contributed to the online discussion, with non-professional individuals and health-<lb/>care organisations being the main influencers. Content was dominated by the words &apos;kidney&apos;, <lb/>&apos;stones&apos;, &apos;pain&apos;, &apos;urine&apos; and &apos;risk&apos;, and tweets had more positive than negative sentiments. The <lb/>top links, photos and retweets were shared up to 100 times. <lb/>The Twitter activity of 10,806 tweets found for #KidneyStones in the study period is much <lb/>higher than 880 tweets found in 2012 for urinary tract infection, another urological disease <lb/>[14]. The majority of Twitter activity data in the literature are published on urological oncology <lb/>diseases, such as #testicularcancer (10,376 tweets in 2014) or #prostatecancer (79,242 tweets in <lb/>2014) [15]. Comparisons of tweet activity between #KidneyStones as a benign disease and <lb/>malignant diseases are compromised since the potentially life-threatening character of onco-<lb/>logical topics has been shown to provoke an over-representation on Twitter [14]. <lb/>The tweet metric analysis showed that contributors interacted using retweets (24%) and <lb/>mentions (30%) in their tweets. Relevant tweets inducing retweets are of high interest to the <lb/>Fig 3. Geolocation of users contributing to the #KidneyStones online discussion on Twitter. The colour tone reflects the number of users <lb/>per country: the colour shifts from light tones (countries with few or no users) to dark tones (countries with many users). <lb/>doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0160863.g003 <lb/></body>

			<body>Twitter community, which is underlined by the recently introduced concept of the Twitter <lb/>impact factor [16]. Moreover, almost half of the tweets were enhanced by a link. This is encour-<lb/>aging since the combination &apos;statement + proof&apos; is a basic principle in science which can be <lb/>translated to Twitter as the combination &apos;statement + link&apos;. A tweet analysis on the topic of <lb/>dementia showed that the top users applied links more frequently than average users [17]. Sim-<lb/>ilarly, successful tweets from public state health departments contained links in the majority of <lb/>tweets [18]. Thus, a high number of links used in tweets for #KidneyStones appears to enhance <lb/>the reach of tweets and enables followers to check the trustworthiness of the short information <lb/>presented in one tweet. Additionally, links enable more information to be conveyed in the <lb/>tweet than the 140 characters would otherwise allow. <lb/>The Twitter discussion on #KidneyStones is global, involving users from all continents. <lb/>Usage rates of social media were 74% among American urologists in 2013 [19] and 70% among <lb/>Australian urologists in 2014 [1]. As social media adoption rates continue to grow, so did the <lb/>number of cumulative contributors to the #KidneyStones discussion. This is in line with our <lb/>previous study on urologic oncology, with steadily increasing tweet activity over time [15]. <lb/>Twitter allows for rapid, informal, and thus low-threshold, participation in an online discus-<lb/>sion. These characteristics make it appealing for laypeople to join in the conversation. Notably, <lb/>Fig 4. Top 100 influencers in the #KidneyStones online discussion on Twitter according to tweet volume stratified by healthcare category. <lb/>Healthcare organisation consists of 8% provider, 1% government, 15% advocate/support and 13% other healthcare organisations (from darker blue to lighter <lb/>blue).

			<body>individuals such as patients, relatives and interested people who are not primarily involved in <lb/>healthcare accounted for a large number of the top influencers in the #KidneyStones discus-<lb/>sion. Similarly, individual and organisational healthcare professionals contributed as top influ-<lb/>encers, which demonstrates the potential of Twitter for disseminating valuable knowledge <lb/>from professionals on preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic options to the populace. <lb/>Particularly noteworthy is the finding of the content analysis, revealing that words symbolis-<lb/>ing disease awareness and prevention are most frequently used in tweets on #KidneyStones. <lb/>Primary prevention of kidney stones has been shown to be cost-effective for a national health-<lb/>care system [20]. This is crucial, particularly considering the rapidly increasing costs of urolith-<lb/>iasis treatment, predicted to be more than US$1 billion annually in the United States by 2030 <lb/>Fig 5.

			<body>[9]. Importantly, urolithiasis is associated with a 30-50% risk of recurrence within seven years <lb/>of initial treatment [21, 22]. Secondary nonmedical prevention with fluid intake, specific die-<lb/>tary therapy, adoption of a &apos;healthy&apos; lifestyle [23-25] as well as preventive pharmacological <lb/>treatment [26-28] were reported to effectively reduce recurrence rates. Unfortunately, due to <lb/>patient and provider scepticism about the evidence of secondary prevention effectiveness, it is <lb/>infrequently utilised in daily routines [29, 30]. An additional hurdle to the implementation of <lb/>preventive measures is low patient compliance; roughly half of stone formers were reported to <lb/>adhere to a prescribed preventive therapy in a contemporary series [30]. Considering the <lb/>under-utilised potential of primary and secondary prevention of urolithiasis, the Twitter plat-<lb/>form might make a beneficial contribution in these areas. The #KidneyStones Twitter discus-<lb/>sion can deliver currently valid guidelines and recommendations on urolithiasis prevention to <lb/>laypeople and thus lead to both a decrease of recurrence rates and increased cost-savings. In <lb/>this context, using links and photos to enhance a tweet&apos;s content and its reach can therefore be <lb/>a successful strategy. The most shared link in our analysis was distributed 587 times and the <lb/>most shared photos and retweets were spread up to nearly 100 times. <lb/>Although the #KidneyStones hashtag is proposed as standardised communication descrip-<lb/>tor [5], we acknowledge that this single hashtag cannot capture all the information that is <lb/>exchanged on urolithiasis on the Twitter platform. Particularly during congresses with high <lb/>tweet activity using multiple hashtags, discussions on stone disease might take place beside the <lb/>#KidneyStones channel. <lb/>We also used the Symplur Signals analytics platform for a systematic assessment of health-<lb/>care social media data. The automated data extraction and analysis algorithms allow for the <lb/>analysis of a vast amount of data, but cannot detect linguistic nuances, such as ambiguity or <lb/>irony when analysing content. Lastly, Twitter is a rapidly growing and changing social media <lb/>platform, implying that the results of our contemporary analysis might be out-dated in the <lb/>near future. <lb/>Notwithstanding the aforementioned limitations, several practice-oriented conclusions can <lb/>be drawn from the findings of the current study. The Twitter discussion on #KidneyStones is <lb/>maintained by users from all over the world and evokes a remarkable number of tweets, under-<lb/>scoring the global reach of this microblogging platform. Healthcare organisations, as one of the <lb/>top influencers in the discussion, have a unique opportunity to raise the awareness of patients <lb/>and providers for nonmedical and pharmacological prevention, eventually reducing recurrence <lb/>rates and care-related expenditure. Patients and other laypeople substantially contributing to <lb/>the discussion have the option of being discreetly and noncommittally counselled by experts, <lb/>optimising shared decision-making. Finally, given responsible Twitter usage, the dissemination <lb/>of novel diagnostic and therapeutic developments in the area of urolithiasis between stakehold-<lb/>ers and patients might be considerably accelerated. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>The Twitter discussion on #KidneyStones engaged multiple stakeholders in the healthcare sec-<lb/>tor on a global scale and involves both professionals and laypeople. Considering the rapidly <lb/>increasing prevalence and treatment-related costs of urolithiasis, Twitter might promote <lb/>shared decision-making and contribute to the optimisation of patient care. <lb/></body>
