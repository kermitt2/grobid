There have been only few case reports describing the complications with the use of this device. Here, we <lb/>present a case of a 77-year-old woman who was admitted due to massive hematochezia while on anticoagulation. She was found to <lb/>have a large rectal ulcer caused by the Flexi-Seal device, used during the last hospital stay for fecal incontinence. Flexi-Seal device <lb/>can be effective for the management of incontinence; however, caution should be exercised during handling and pressure from the <lb/>retention balloon should be relieved periodically. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Fecal incontinence is not uncommon in acutely ill hospital-<lb/>ized patients, occurring in up to 33% of critically ill patients <lb/>often in association with diarrhea [1]. The etiology of diar-<lb/>rhea or fecal incontinence, in critically ill patients, is often <lb/>unknown and can be multifactorial. Managing diarrhea in <lb/>such patients presents a challenging problem in patient man-<lb/>agement as it can lead to breakdown of skin, ulceration, and <lb/>infection [2]. Flexi-Seal Fecal Management system (FSFMS) <lb/>(ConvaTec Professional Services) was designed to provide <lb/>a safe and effective diversion of liquid stool away from the <lb/>skin and has been adopted by many intensive care units <lb/>(ICUs). These devices reduce the need for labor-intensive <lb/>nursing care, decrease the risk of perianal skin breakdown, <lb/>and decrease transmission of fecal microbiota. These devices <lb/>consist of a soft silicon catheter and a retention balloon that is <lb/>inflated with 45 ml of saline or water. This balloon is inflated <lb/>in the rectum to form a seal that prevents seepage of fecal <lb/>contents around it. These devices are often believed to be <lb/>safe and effective, and some studies have demonstrated their <lb/>successful use in patients with diarrhea [3]. However, there <lb/>have been few cases in the literature describing the adverse <lb/>effects from the pressure necrosis or traumatic removal of <lb/>such devices. Such complications include rectal ampullary <lb/>ulcers, rectal fissures, and fatal bleeding due to rectal trauma. <lb/>Although limited, such reports suggest that these devices may <lb/>have a higher morbidity risk than previously believed. Here, <lb/>we present a case of a 77-year-old woman who developed <lb/>hematochezia while on anticoagulation. Further investiga-<lb/>tion revealed bleeding rectal ulcer secondary to the recent use <lb/>of the Flexi-Seal system. <lb/>2. Case Report <lb/>A 77-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung <lb/>disease was admitted to ICU due to multiple episodes of <lb/>lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Vital signs revealed a blood <lb/>pressure of 98/68 mm Hg, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, <lb/>respiratory rate of 18/min, and temperature of 97.5 degrees <lb/>Fahrenheit. Rectal examination was unremarkable except <lb/>for bright red blood on the examining finger. Laboratory <lb/>workup revealed a WBC count of 8.6 × 109/L, hemoglobin <lb/>level of 8.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 250,000/ L. Seven <lb/>days before the current admission, she was discharged after <lb/>an extended stay in ICU for respiratory failure requiring <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 1: Flexible sigmoidoscopy showing a circumferential rectal <lb/>ulcer with erythematous mucosa. <lb/>intubation and mechanical ventilation. She was diagnosed <lb/>with bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis and was <lb/>discharged on apixaban. Hemoglobin level was 10.3 g/dL at <lb/>the time of discharge. During the current hospitalization, <lb/>apixaban was held, and the patient was given intravenous <lb/>fluids. Gastroenterology consultation was obtained, and an <lb/>esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed to rule <lb/>out rapid upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. EGD was <lb/>unremarkable with no evidence of fresh or old blood until <lb/>the second part of the duodenum. Flexible sigmoidoscopy <lb/>showed some retained stool in the rectum. However, there <lb/>was a large area of ulceration and erythema involving most <lb/>of the circumference of the rectal wall (Figures 1 and 2). This <lb/>ulcerated area extended up to 15 cm from the anal verge. The <lb/>scope was advanced up to 35 cm from the anal verge and rest <lb/>of the colonic mucosa was normal. Multiple biopsies taken <lb/>from the ulcer edge revealed necrotic epithelium with no <lb/>evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. Chart review revealed <lb/>that the patient had Flexi-Seal system placed for low-volume <lb/>diarrhea during the last hospital stay. Flexi-Seal was placed <lb/>for a total of 9 days and removed after stool output slowed <lb/>down. Otherwise, there was no history of rectal trauma or <lb/>rectal surgery in the past. <lb/>Bleeding ceased after anticoagulation was discontinued <lb/>and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed to prevent <lb/>pulmonary embolism. The patient was discharged without <lb/>anticoagulation. There was no subsequent episode of GI <lb/>bleeding. <lb/>3. Discussion <lb/>Diarrhea and fecal incontinence are a widespread problem in <lb/>critically ill patients [4-6]. Critical illness is by itself a risk <lb/>factor for diarrhea, while other factors include physiological <lb/>Figure 2: Flexible sigmoidoscopy showing a part of circumferential <lb/>ulcer in the rectum. <lb/>stress, medications (magnesium, laxatives), lack of fibers in <lb/>enteral feed, and alteration in intestinal flora due to antibiotic <lb/>use [4, 7]. Diarrhea can compromise the management of <lb/>the patient and cause considerable morbidity due to skin <lb/>breakdown and infection. Recently, the use of indwelling <lb/>intrarectal fecal collection systems has gained popularity <lb/>because of their effectiveness in diverting fecal material away <lb/>from the patient. The Flexi-Seal device (FMS; ConvaTec, <lb/>Division of E.R. Squibb &amp; Sons, LLC, Princeton, NJ) is the <lb/>most widely used device designed to be used continuously for <lb/>up to 30 days. <lb/>The first report describing the potential adverse effects of <lb/>the Flexi-Seal system was a prospective, multicenter, clinical <lb/>study involving 42 patients [3]. This study reported 2 cases of <lb/>generalized skin breakdown and one case of rectal bleeding <lb/>resulting from pressure ulceration. Subsequently, there have <lb/>been a handful of reports of adverse effects arising from the <lb/>use of such device. There are 9 case reports in the literature <lb/>reporting 13 patients who had lower GI bleeding secondary <lb/>to either an ulcer or laceration secondary to use of Flexi-Seal <lb/>device. <lb/>Page et al. (2008) reported the case of a 65-year-old man <lb/>who developed severe bleeding from the rectal mucosa due <lb/>to a laceration, 6 cm from the anal verge, which was sutured. <lb/>This laceration was attributed to the use of the Flexi-Seal <lb/>system for six days [8]. Bright et al. [9] reported lower GI <lb/>bleeding in a 79-year-old man 11 days after insertion of a <lb/>Flexi-Seal device. Colonoscopy findings at the time were <lb/>suggestive of pressure necrosis in the rectal area. Mesenteric <lb/>angiography showed extravasation of contrast material from <lb/>a branch of the superior rectal artery, and coil embolization <lb/></body>

			<body>was successfully performed. Sparks et al. (2010) reported 3 <lb/>cases of massive GI bleeding associated with the use of the <lb/>Flexi-Seal device [10]. The first patient, a 72-year-old woman, <lb/>presented with two episodes of lower GI bleeding due to <lb/>a rectal laceration 4 cm proximal to the dentate line. The <lb/>laceration was sutured after the second episode of bleeding. <lb/>The second patient was a 54-year-old woman on warfarin <lb/>who also presented with lower GI bleeding secondary to a <lb/>tear of the anterior rectal wall 3 cm from the anal verge. The <lb/>tear was treated with direct pressure, application of thrombin, <lb/>and suture ligation. The third patient was a 59-year-old man <lb/>on warfarin who was admitted due to a single episode of <lb/>GI bleeding secondary to a mucosal ulcer in the proximal <lb/>part of the anal canal. No treatment other than reversal of <lb/>anticoagulation was required. Monge et al. (2011) reported <lb/>two patients with rectal hemorrhage associated with the <lb/>Flexi-Seal device [11]. The first patient was a 71-year-old man <lb/>on prophylactic dose enoxaparin who presented with rectal <lb/>hemorrhage 25 days after insertion of the device. Endoscopy <lb/>revealed a mucosal ulcer in the distal part of the rectum. <lb/>The second patient was a 67-year-old woman who had two <lb/>episodes of rectal bleeding secondary to a mucosal ulcer in <lb/>the posterior distal part of the rectum. Walsh and Sanders <lb/>(2010) reported a case of fatal hemorrhage arising from a <lb/>rectal ulcer caused by rectal tube [12]. The patient died despite <lb/>clipping, banding, and injecting the lesion with epinephrine. <lb/>Reynolds and van Haren (2012) reported a case in which <lb/>a 50-year-old man on heparin developed lower GI bleeding <lb/>five days after insertion of a Flexi-Seal device [13]. Endoscopy <lb/>revealed a mucosal ulcer in the distal part of the rectum <lb/>10 cm from the anal verge. The lesion was cauterized, injected <lb/>with epinephrine, and suture-ligated. Mulhall and Jindal <lb/>(2013) reported a case of a 58-year-old man with lower GI <lb/>bleeding 13 days after insertion of the Flexi-Seal device [14]. <lb/>Angiography revealed bleeding from a medial branch of the <lb/>superior rectal artery which was then embolized. Eleven <lb/>days later, the patient developed another episode of massive <lb/>rectal bleeding and colonoscopy showed a posterior rectal <lb/>laceration that was not actively bleeding and an anterior <lb/>rectal ulcer with active hemorrhage. Hemostasis of the ulcer <lb/>was achieved by suture ligation and application of topical <lb/>thrombin. Popek and Senagore (2013) reported two cases <lb/>of Flexi-Seal device-related complication [15]. The first case <lb/>involved a 60-year-old woman who developed bright red <lb/>blood per rectum from a bleeding rectal ulcer for which a <lb/>clip was placed. Two weeks later, the patient again developed <lb/>rectal bleeding, and an angiogram identified a bleeding vessel <lb/>in the rectum, which was suture-ligated. The second patient <lb/>was a 39-year-old patient admitted for sepsis and multiple <lb/>organ failure. Three weeks after placement of the Flexi-Seal <lb/>device, he began having bright red blood per rectum. Flexible <lb/>sigmoidoscopy demonstrated a pulsatile vessel in the rectum, <lb/>and the patient was taken to the operating room for suture <lb/>ligation of the vessel. Shaker et al. (2014) reported a case <lb/>of a 75-year-old female with atrial fibrillation on warfarin <lb/>[16]. She developed lower GI bleeding 12 days after insertion <lb/>of the Flexi-Seal device. CT angiogram showed that the <lb/>bleeding was originating from the distal rectum. Flexible <lb/>sigmoidoscopy showed severe ulceration involving the whole <lb/>circumference of the rectum and evidence of active bleeding <lb/>from a small artery. Hemostasis was achieved via argon-beam <lb/>photocoagulation, a hemostatic stitch to the bleeding point, <lb/>and packing of the rectum with alginate ribbon. <lb/>Whiteley et al. published a retrospective study analyzing <lb/>the complications of Flexi-Seal in acute care setting [17]. <lb/>The records of 50 patients who had a total of 69 study FMS <lb/>inserted (mean: 1.4 FMS) were included in the study. Most <lb/>patients (37, 74%) experienced no complications; 7 (14%) had <lb/>their retention balloon overinflated but suffered no injury to <lb/>the rectal mucosa; 4 (8%) experienced temporary anal atony; <lb/>and 2 (4%) suffered excessive leak of stool around the device. <lb/>The pathophysiology of rectal ulceration or laceration due <lb/>to the Flexi-Seal device is due to the pressure exerted by the <lb/>retention balloon that, when inflated with saline, allows the <lb/>catheter to remain anchored in the rectal ampulla. Build-<lb/>up of semisolid fecal material above the level of the balloon <lb/>may also contribute towards pressure necrosis, a mechanism <lb/>similar to stercoral perforation caused by fecal impaction in <lb/>severely constipated patients [18]. Therefore, the retention <lb/>balloon should be periodically deflated to allow the fecal <lb/>build-up to flow around the tubing and to release pressure <lb/>on the mucosal wall. <lb/>This is the second case report in the literature of circum-<lb/>ferential rectal ulceration secondary to a Flexi-Seal device. <lb/>Our patient was on anticoagulation, which might have trig-<lb/>gered bleeding from the rectal ulcer. However, as described <lb/>above, there have been cases where the patient had substantial <lb/>lower GI bleeding without anticoagulation. <lb/>In conclusion, Flexi-Seal is a useful device for controlling <lb/>fecal incontinence. However, it is important to exercise <lb/>caution with prolonged use of this device. Patients on anti-<lb/>coagulation should be closely monitored for any signs of <lb/>lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The continued need for <lb/>the utilization of this device should be assessed daily, and a <lb/>low threshold for removal should be employed. <lb/></body>
