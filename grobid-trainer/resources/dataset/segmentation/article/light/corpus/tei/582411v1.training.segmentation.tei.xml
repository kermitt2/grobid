			<front>Abstract <lb/>All four subspecies of chimpanzees are endangered. Differing in their demographic histories <lb/>and geographical ranges within sub-Saharan Africa, they have likely adapted to different <lb/>environmental factors. We show that highly differentiated SNPs in eastern chimpanzees are <lb/>uniquely enriched in genic sites in a way that is expected under recent adaptation. These sites <lb/>are enriched for genes that differentiate the immune response to infection by simian <lb/>immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in natural vs. non-natural host species. Conversely, central <lb/>chimpanzees exhibit selective sweeps at the cytokine receptors CCR3, CCR9 and CXCR6 -<lb/>paralogs of CCR5 and CXCR4, the two major receptors utilized by HIV to enter human cells. <lb/>Thus, we infer that SIV may be eliciting distinctive adaptive responses in different chimpanzee <lb/>subspecies. Since central chimpanzee SIV is the source of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic, <lb/>understanding the mechanisms that limit pathogenicity of SIV in chimpanzees can broaden our <lb/>understanding of HIV infection in humans. <lb/></front>

			<body>Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are, alongside bonobos, human&apos;s closest living relatives -the <lb/>Pan and Homo lineages having diverged ~6Myr ago (Prado-Martinez et al. 2013). With a <lb/>genetic divergence of only ~1% (Consortium et al. 2005), Pan and Homo also share large <lb/>aspects of their physiology and behaviour, including susceptibility to some pathogens. <lb/>Studying chimpanzees can teach us about our species by putting recent human evolution in its <lb/>evolutionary context i.e. the mode and tempo of adaptation and the pressures driving it. <lb/>Selection imposed by pathogens has greatly shaped the long-term history of genetic adaptation <lb/>in the great apes, including chimpanzees and humans (Cagan et al. 2016, Enard et al. 2016). <lb/>The interest in recent human evolution (Sabeti et al. 2002, Voight et al. 2006, Sabeti et al. 2007, <lb/>Yi et al. 2010, Racimo 2016) means that we now also have good catalogues of the main targets <lb/>of local adaptation in many non-African human populations. Nevertheless, analyses of <lb/>genome-wide patterns of diversity suggest that adaptation via hard selective sweeps has had a <lb/>limited role in shaping human genomes. Complete selective sweeps involving non-<lb/>synonymous substitutions appear to have been rare (Hernandez et al. 2011) -but perhaps still <lb/>important (Enard, Messer, and Petrov 2014). Further, local adaptation has had little effect on <lb/>the patterns of population differentiation (Coop et al. 2009), unless inferences are boosted with <lb/>ancient DNA (Key et al. 2016). The focus on humans biases our view on the influence of <lb/>genetic adaptations in natural populations of primates, and we do not know whether positive <lb/>selection plays a similarly limited role in shaping other primate genomes. We aim to address <lb/>this limitation by exploring the recent adaptive history of chimpanzees. <lb/>There are four subspecies of chimpanzees, with common names reflecting their location in <lb/>western and central sub-Saharan Africa: eastern, central, Nigeria-Cameroon and western <lb/>(Figure 1). Each chimpanzee subspecies is currently endangered, with western chimpanzees <lb/></body>

			<body>critically so (Humle et al. 2016). Subspecies are clearly differentiated, with divergence times <lb/>ranging from 450 kya to 100 kya, and estimated long-term Ne from 8,000 to 30,000 reflected <lb/>in varying levels of genetic diversity (Figure 1). There is a wide range of ecological variation <lb/>across the chimpanzee range, which spans over 5,000 km in sub-Saharan Africa and includes <lb/>deep forest and savanna-woodland mosaics. Pathogen incidence can also vary between these <lb/>groups, as seen recently with the lethal outbreaks of Anthrax (Leendertz et al. 2004) and Ebola <lb/>(Formenty et al. 1999), or the Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). SIV, the precursor of the <lb/>human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virus that is responsible for the human AIDS <lb/>pandemic (Keele et al. 2006), is thought to be largely non-lethal to chimpanzees, although some <lb/>eastern chimpanzees can develop immunodeficiency, see (Rudicell et al. 2010, Keele et al. <lb/>2009)). Its prevalence is not uniform across the subspecies, and there is no evidence for <lb/>infections in western or Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees (Locatelli et al. 2016) but multiple <lb/>infections have been detected in communities of central and eastern chimpanzees (Locatelli et <lb/>al. 2016, Heuverswyn et al. 2007). Given the separate history and differential environment of <lb/>each subspecies, and the fact that each subspecies is an independent conservation unit, it is <lb/>crucial that we identify not only the genetic adaptations shared by all chimpanzees (Cagan et <lb/>al. 2016), but also the genetic differences conferring differential adaptation to each subspecies. <lb/>To do this, we investigated the signatures of recent genetic adaptation in the genomes of the <lb/>four subspecies. We show that only eastern chimpanzees have a clear genome-wide signal of <lb/>recent, local positive selection. This adaptation is potentially due to selection on immunity <lb/>related genes, with evidence consistent with selection imposed by viruses in general, and SIV <lb/>in particular. In contrast, putative adaptation to SIV in central chimpanzees seems mediated by <lb/>adaptation in a suite of cell-entry receptors, results which are suggestive of divergent paths of <lb/>adaptation to a common pathogen. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>Genic enrichment in the distribution of derived allele frequency differences <lb/>To investigate the influence of recent genetic adaptation in chimpanzee subspecies we <lb/>compared population differentiation at putatively functional sites (genic sites, defined as +-<lb/>2kb from protein-coding genes) to differentiation at non-functional sites (here non-genic). <lb/>Natural selection can only act on functional sites (or affect neutral sites tightly linked to <lb/>functional sites), so differences between functional and non-functional sites can be ascribed to <lb/>natural selection. After binning every SNP by its signed difference in derived allele frequency <lb/>between a pair of subspecies (), for each bin of  we calculated the genic enrichment, defined <lb/>as the ratio of genic SNPs vs. all SNPs for each bin of , normalized by the global genic SNP <lb/>ratio (Coop et al. 2009, Hernandez et al. 2011, Key et al. 2016). This strategy has been deployed <lb/>in the study of human local adaptation (Coop et al. 2009, Hernandez et al. 2011, Key et al. <lb/>2016), and by not relying on the patterns of linked variation it is not strongly restricted to <lb/>particular modes of selection. The genic enrichment is greatest for SNPs with the largest , <lb/>with the tail bins of  exhibiting significantly greater genic enrichments than any other bin <lb/>(Figure 2). While not every genic SNP is in this bin due to positive selection, we expect these <lb/>SNPs, which show the largest frequency differences between subspecies in the genome, to be <lb/>strongly enriched in targets of positive selection that rose fast in frequency in one of the two <lb/>subspecies (Coop et al. 2009, Hernandez et al. 2011, Key et al. 2016). <lb/>The genic enrichment in the tails of  is typically roughly symmetric (Figure 2a, symmetry <lb/>defined as overlapping  tail bin genic enrichment 95% CIs), although the number of tail SNPs <lb/>and the magnitude of genic enrichment across subspecies pairs varies in accordance with their <lb/>Ne and divergence times (Figure 2 and Supplementary file 1). Calculated against western <lb/>chimpanzees, the subspecies with the lowest long-term Ne (de Manuel et al. 2016, Prado-<lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>Martinez et al. 2013), the  tail genic enrichment is the least, ranging from 1.05 to 1.09 (Figure <lb/>2a). A greater tail genic enrichment, 1.21 to 1.27, is seen for  calculated using Nigeria-<lb/>Cameroon, the species with the second lowest long-term Ne (Figure 2a). This is comparable to <lb/>the magnitude of the genic enrichment in the tails of  between human populations (Appendix <lb/>1, Appendix 1-figure 1; see (Coop et al. 2009, Hernandez et al. 2011, Key et al. 2016); the <lb/>genic enrichment across each bin of  also resembles those observed in human populations <lb/>(Appendix 1, Appendix 1-figure 1; see (Coop et al. 2009, Hernandez et al. 2011, Key et al. <lb/>2016). <lb/>In marked contrast to these symmetric enrichments, we find a distinctive asymmetry between <lb/>the tail bin genic enrichments of central and eastern chimpanzees (Figure 2b). The central  <lb/>tail exhibits a typical genic enrichment (1.25) but surprisingly, the eastern  tail has a genic <lb/>enrichment (1.58) that is significantly greater than the central tail (0.01 &lt; P &lt; 0.005; weighted <lb/>200kb block jackknife, see Methods) and any other  tail (all P &lt; 0.0001; weighted 200kb block <lb/>jackknife). <lb/>The large confidence interval of the central chimpanzee  tail genic enrichment is largely due <lb/>to the low number but high linkage of SNPs. For example, we found a highly unusual 200kb <lb/>genomic block on chromosome 3 that contains 70 highly differentiated alleles between central <lb/>and eastern chimpanzees, similarly distributed among the two tails (37 SNPs in the Central tail <lb/>and 33 SNPs in the Eastern tail). Concerned that this block could bias our results, we repeated <lb/>the enrichment analysis after excluding all SNPs contained within it. Removing this block <lb/>reduces the genic enrichment slightly in the Eastern tail (1.55) but substantially in the Central <lb/>tail (1.10) resulting in an even stronger asymmetry among the tails. Results are also robust to <lb/>the removal of the next largest block (with 27 SNPs in the two tails). <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>To directly quantify asymmetry of the eastern and central chimpanzee  tail genic enrichments, <lb/>we tested if the log2 ratio of each pair of  tail bin genic enrichments departs from zero. <lb/>Typically, the genic enrichment is greater for the subspecies with the higher long-term Ne. <lb/>However, the log2 ratios are similar and small (ranging from 0 and 0.055), except for eastern <lb/>vs. central, where it is 0.337 (95% CI, 0.153-0.521, 200kb weighted block jackknife). This is <lb/>six times larger than the highest ratio between other subspecies pairs (Figure 3; Supplementary <lb/>file 2, p-value  western vs. central = 0.13 all other p-values &lt;= 0.002, z-test). The eastern vs. <lb/>central asymmetry in genic enrichment is thus a clear outlier (p-value &lt; 2.2e-16, two-sided <lb/>Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). <lb/>Background selection does not explain the  tail asymmetry <lb/>A certain level of  tail bin genic enrichment (Figure 2) is, in principle, compatible with both <lb/>recent positive selection and background selection (BGS) (Coop et al. 2009), the latter because <lb/>linkage to sites under purifying selection reduces Ne locally in genic regions and increases the <lb/>effects of random genetic drift on neutral sites (Charlesworth, Morgan, and Charlesworth <lb/>1993). BGS can, for example, explain the  tail bin genic enrichment in human populations, <lb/>suggesting that this pattern is not evidence for pervasive recent human adaptation (Coop et al. <lb/>2009, Hernandez et al. 2011, Key et al. 2016). To explore if BGS can explain our observations, <lb/>we used coalescent simulations (Methods) to estimate the expected reduction of neutral <lb/>diversity due to BGS, quantified as a genome-wide average B value (McVicker et al. 2009) <lb/>that best explains the genic enrichments across all bins of  (the B value that minimizes the <lb/>summed square differences between observed and simulated enrichments across all pairwise  <lb/>bins, Appendix 2). This B value is 0.888 -i.e. a reduction of diversity of ~ 11 per cent -<lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>decreasing to 0.925 (weaker BGS) when excluding the  tail bins, and increasing to 0.863 <lb/>(stronger BGS) when fitting solely the twelve  tail bins (Appendix 2, Supplementary file 4). <lb/>These values agree well with those inferred in humans using similar approaches (Hernandez et <lb/>al. 2011, Key et al. 2016). It is nonetheless clear that the B value of 0.863 that explains the  <lb/>tail bin genic enrichments results in an extremely poor fit to the genic enrichments in all other <lb/> bins (Figure 2). <lb/>Previously, it was shown that BGS alone does not produce  tail bin genic enrichment <lb/>asymmetries in comparisons of human populations (Key et al. 2016). We also find that BGS <lb/>does not result in significant eastern vs. central  tail bin genic enrichment asymmetry. <lb/>Simulations show a slight asymmetry in the tail genic enrichment (Figs. 2B, 3) due to <lb/>differences in their demographic histories (Appendix 2, Supplementary file 5). Nevertheless, <lb/>no simulated value of B in the reasonable range identified above (0.925 -0.863) results in a <lb/>tail genic enrichment log2 ratio that falls within the 95% CI of the observed ratio (Figure 3). In <lb/>contrast, the small (though statistically significant) asymmetries in other pairwise  tail bin <lb/>genic enrichments are observed in simulations and thus fully explicable by demography and <lb/>BGS (Figure 3). Further, while we find one B value, B = 0.850, that results in a genic <lb/>enrichment that lies within the 95% CIs for both eastern and central chimpanzees, this B value <lb/>is a very poor fit to the genic enrichment in all other  bins (Supplementary file 4) and cannot <lb/>explain the  tail bin genic enrichment asymmetry (observed = 0.337, simulated B of 0.850 = <lb/>0.104). <lb/>Previous work has shown that background selection varies little among the great apes (Nam et <lb/>al. 2017). Theory suggests that the diversity reducing effect of BGS is independent of Ne, being <lb/>determined by the distribution of fitness effects (s), except for the narrow range of Ne * s = 1 <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>(Nam et al., 2017), while previous work suggests that more than 80% of deleterious mutations <lb/>in chimpanzees have Nes » 1 (Bataillon et al. 2015) Thus, the expectation is that the diversity <lb/>reducing effect of BGS should be the same across all four chimpanzee sub-species. Indeed, we <lb/>find comparable effects of background selection across subspecies: the relative reduction in <lb/>neutral variation linked to genes is comparable amongst chimpanzee subspecies (Appendix 3-<lb/>figure 1a), and neutral diversity has similar dependency on recombination rate and density of <lb/>functional features across subspecies (with the exception of western chimpanzees, Appendix <lb/>3-figure 1b). Further, using a population genetic statistical model (Corbett-Detig, Hartl, and <lb/>Sackton 2015) we estimate the same reduction in neutral diversity due to background selection <lb/>in each chimpanzee subspecies, at 11%, in the highest likelihood model (Appendix 3, <lb/>Supplementary file 6). Thus, despite their differing demographic histories (Figure 1), the <lb/>effects of BGS are very similar across each chimpanzee subspecies. This justifies using the <lb/>same average strength of BGS across subspecies above. Nevertheless, to explore if our <lb/>conclusions are robust to this assumption, we also modelled a greater strength of BGS in <lb/>eastern chimpanzees (B = 0.825, the value which best matches the eastern  tail bin genic <lb/>enrichment) than in the other subspecies (B range 0.900-0.850). Stronger BGS in eastern <lb/>chimpanzees does not produce an eastern central  tail bin asymmetry as large as that observed <lb/>in the genomes (log2 ratio range 0.120 -0.146), further illustrating that BGS cannot explain <lb/>the greater tail genic enrichment in eastern chimpanzees (Figure 3-figure supplement 1). <lb/>Rather, this is most likely a signal of recent adaptation. <lb/>Population-specific branch lengths with PBSnj <lb/>Pairwise comparisons cannot determine which subspecies has changed. Direction, and <lb/>therefore biological meaning, to allele frequency difference can only be garnered by assuming <lb/>that derived alleles most often provide the basis for new adaptations. This approach is also <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>limited by the collapsing of the shared history of lineages. For example, in the Nigeria-<lb/>Cameroon vs. Eastern comparison, 22% of the SNPs in the Eastern  tail are also in the Central <lb/> tail (for Nigeria-Cameroon vs. Central comparison), whereas only 3.5% (616 of 17,793) are <lb/>highly differentiated to both Nigeria and Central chimpanzees. Thus,  summarises the allele <lb/>frequency change across several parts of the phylogeny, hampering the biological interpretation <lb/>of its tails. <lb/>To overcome this limitation, we developed a statistic that extends the widely used Population <lb/>Branch Statistic (PBS) (Yi et al. 2010). Briefly, large PBS values identify targets of positive <lb/>selection as SNPs with population-specific allele frequency differentiation, as these sites result <lb/>in unusually long branch lengths in pairwise FST-distance trees between three taxa. Small PBS <lb/>values are due to very short branches, for example due to purifying, shared balancing selection <lb/>or rare mutations. We extend this test to more than three taxa in the novel PBSnj statistic by <lb/>applying the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) algorithm on the matrix of the per-SNP pairwise FST <lb/>distances of the four subspecies (Methods, Appendix 4). This way, PBSnj allows us to jointly <lb/>compare the four subspecies and identify SNPs with very long branches (allele frequency <lb/>differentiation) in one subspecies only. Additional advantages of PBSnj are that it does not rely <lb/>on the specification of ancestral or derived states, and that the NJ algorithm does not require <lb/>specification of a phylogenetic tree describing the relationship amongst taxa (Appendix 4). <lb/>PBSnj allows us to determine within which lineage, eastern or central chimpanzees, allele <lb/>frequencies have changed to result in the asymmetric  genic enrichment. Analogous to the  <lb/>tail bins, we binned PBSnj scores and calculated the genic enrichment for each species PBSnj <lb/>tail (Figure 4A). The PBSnj eastern tail has significantly stronger genic enrichment than the <lb/>central tail (eastern: 1.36, central: 1.13, log2 ratio = 0.25, p &lt; 0.001 estimated from weighted <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>200kb block jackknife, Figure 4B). This shows that the central vs. eastern asymmetry in the  <lb/>tail bin genic enrichments (Figs. 2B, 3) is due to the drastic allele frequency rise of genic SNPs <lb/>in eastern chimpanzees since their divergence with central chimpanzees. Importantly, across <lb/>the range of B values (1.0 -0.80), simulations show that eastern and central chimpanzee PBSnj <lb/>tail genic enrichments are expected to be equal (Figure 4B). In fact, BGS would need to be <lb/>much stronger in eastern chimpanzees than in central chimpanzees to produce the observed <lb/>levels of PBSnj tail genic enrichments. BGS with B &lt; 0.888 would be required to produce the <lb/>genic enrichment exhibited in the eastern PBSnj tail, but B = 0.888 produces PBSnj tail genic <lb/>enrichments of equal or greater magnitude as those seen for central chimpanzees (and also <lb/>Nigeria-Cameroon and western, Appendix 5 and Appendix 6, and Supplementary file 9). Thus, <lb/>it is eastern chimpanzees that exhibit the greatest genic enrichment for highly differentiated <lb/>SNPs, an enrichment that (unlike in other subspecies) we cannot explain by background <lb/>selection alone. This suggests the greater enrichment in the PBSnj eastern tail is due to positive <lb/>selection, and by using the genomic blocks used to estimate the PBSnj tail Confidence Intervals <lb/>in Figure 4A, we estimate that an additional eight-19 population specific sweeps are sufficient <lb/>to explain this difference (Methods, Figure 4-figure supplement 1). Although this is a <lb/>conservative estimate, it shows that we do not require an unrealistically large number of <lb/>selective sweeps to explain the distinct pattern of eastern chimpanzees. <lb/>Long-range LD and regulatory functions in the PBSnj eastern tail SNPs <lb/>Further evidence that the PBSnj eastern tail genic enrichment is not due to background <lb/>selection would be provided by independent signatures such as the patterns of linkage <lb/>disequilibrium (LD) and the putative functional consequences of alleles. LD based tests of <lb/>positive selection are more robust to background selection than those based on population <lb/>differentiation (Enard, Messer, and Petrov 2014). We computed three haplotype-based <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>selection statistics that identify the signatures of positive selection within populations (iHS; <lb/>(Voight et al. 2006), nSl (Ferrer-Admetlla et al. 2014)) or between populations (XP-EHH <lb/>(Sabeti et al. 2007)). For each statistic, PBSnj eastern tail SNPs have a significantly higher <lb/>score than randomly sampled genic SNPs (mean iHS 0.69, mean nSl 0.94, and mean XP-EHH <lb/>mean 0.51, standardized for the genic background to have mean = 0 and sd = 1 for each statistic; <lb/>all p &lt; 0.0001; re-sampling test; Supplementary file 10). Thus, SNPs specifically differentiated <lb/>in the eastern PBSnj tail have on average higher LD-based signatures of recent positive <lb/>selection than random genic SNPs, and also to a greater degree than all other subspecies&apos; PBSnj <lb/>tails (Supplementary file 10) (two-sample t-tests, all p-values &lt;&lt; 0.0001). <lb/>PBSnj tail genic SNPs are significantly enriched in exonic variants, but not in non-synonymous <lb/>(as compared with synonymous) ones, so less than 1% of PBSnj eastern tail SNPs result in <lb/>amino acid changes (observed = 0.84%; genic background = 0.18 %, p &lt; 0.001, Supplementary <lb/>file 11 lists PBSnj eastern tail non-synonymous SNPs). Turning to regulatory changes, we used <lb/>regulomeDB (Boyle et al. 2012) to predict putative regulatory consequences of chimpanzee <lb/>SNPs from the sequence context and biochemical signatures of homologous human sites. The <lb/>PBSnj eastern tail genic SNPs are more likely to have strong evidence of regulatory function <lb/>(3.7% vs. 3.0%, permutation test p = 0.012) and less likely to have no ascribed regulatory <lb/>function (52.3% vs. 56.0%, permutation test p = 0.0001) than randomly sampled genic SNPs, <lb/>Supplementary file 12. In contrast, PBSnj central tail SNPs show no difference to the genic <lb/>background for either category (Supplementary file 12; Nigeria-Cameroon and western also <lb/>exhibit weaker but significant enrichments). Interestingly, PBSnj eastern tail SNPs do not differ <lb/>in functional constraint (as measured by phastCons scores (Siepel et al. 2005, see Methods) <lb/>from random genic SNPs (Supplementary file 13). This suggests that while likely enriched in <lb/>regulatory functions, these sites are not under particularly strong long-term constraint, perhaps <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>because they do not affect functions that have been tightly conserved over long evolutionary <lb/>times. <lb/>Biological functions of the PBSnj eastern tail SNPs <lb/>To understand the biological mechanisms and putative selective factors driving the recent <lb/>adaptations in eastern chimpanzees, we investigated the genes containing the genic SNPs in <lb/>the PBSnj eastern tail (hereafter PBSnj eastern genes). Two Gene Ontology (GO) categories <lb/>(Ashburner et al. 2000, The Gene Ontology 2017) are significantly enriched (p &lt; 0.05, False <lb/>Discovery Rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05; GOWINDA; Supplementary files 15-18). The top category is <lb/>&quot;cytoplasmic mRNA processing body assembly&quot;, and three of the five PBSnj eastern genes in <lb/>this category (DDX6 (Ayache et al. 2015), ATXN2 (Nonhoff et al. 2007) and DYNC1H1 <lb/>(Loschi et al. 2009)) are either key components of processing bodies (P-bodies) or regulate the <lb/>assembly or growth of P-bodies in response to stress. Selection on the immune system is <lb/>suggested by the second category, &quot;antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via <lb/>MHC class I&quot;. The signal in this category is due to six genes, of which only HLA-A is an MHC <lb/>gene, with the other genes being B2M, ERAP1, PDI3, SEC13, and SEC24B. With FDR &lt; 0.1, <lb/>there are three more significant categories related with immunity: &quot;T cell co-stimulation&quot;, <lb/>&quot;negative regulation of complement-dependent cytotoxicity&quot;, and &quot;type I interferon signalling <lb/>pathway&quot;. There is thus a preponderance of immunity-related GO categories and genes <lb/>involved in anti-viral activity (see Discussion). Even the &quot;cytoplasmic mRNA processing body <lb/>assembly&quot; category is potentially linked to virus infection as P-bodies are cytoplasmic RNA <lb/>granules manipulated by viruses to promote viral survival and achieve infection (Tsai and <lb/>Lloyd 2014, Lloyd 2013). Interestingly, the PBSnj eastern genes are also enriched in three sets <lb/>of Viral Interacting Proteins (VIPs) (see Supplementary files 19-22), which are genes with no <lb/>annotated immune functions but that interact with viruses (Enard et al. 2016). As VIP sets do <lb/>not in the main contain classic or known immunity genes, this provides an independent signal <lb/></body>

			<body>for the relevance of viruses in this gene set. Together, these results suggest that adaptation to <lb/>pathogens, and viruses in particular, may have had an important role in the recent adaptation <lb/>in eastern chimpanzees. <lb/>Amongst chimpanzee viruses, the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is intensively studied <lb/>as it is the progenitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that created the global <lb/>acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic. It is also of interest here because it <lb/>appears to only infect natural populations of eastern and central chimpanzees (Santiago et al. <lb/>2002, Santiago et al. 2003, Nerrienet et al. 2005, Boué et al. 2015), and because it has mediated <lb/>fast, recent adaptations in other natural hosts (Svardal et al. 2017). Svardal et. al. (2017) <lb/>investigated a set of genes that change expression in response to SIV infection in SIV natural <lb/>hosts (vervet monkeys) but not in non-natural hosts that develop immunodeficiency <lb/>(macaques) (Jacquelin et al. 2014, Jacquelin et al. 2009), hereafter referred to as &quot;natural host <lb/>SIV responsive genes&quot;. Natural host SIV responsive genes are likely involved in the specific, <lb/>early immune response of natural hosts to SIV infection, which limits the effects of the virus <lb/>and prevents subsequent immunodeficiency. These genes show signatures of positive selection <lb/>in vervet monkeys, suggesting that ongoing adaptation to the virus in natural hosts can occur <lb/>(Svardal et al. 2017). Strikingly, the PBSnj eastern tail SNPs are significantly enriched in these <lb/>same natural host SIV responsive genes (Jacquelin et al. 2014, Jacquelin et al. 2009) (observed <lb/>118 genes, expected 100, p-value = 0.0195, GOWINDA, FDR &lt; 0.1 see Methods, Table 1, <lb/>Supplementary file 23). In fact, the set of natural host SIV responsive genes can fully explain <lb/>the unique eastern signature: the asymmetry in the PBSnj tail is abolished when this set of <lb/>genes is removed from the analysis (genic enrichment in the eastern PBSnj tail decreases from <lb/>1.36 to 1.26, and the 95% confidence interval of this point estimate now overlaps those of <lb/>Nigeria-Cameroon and central chimpanzees (Methods). A reduction in the genic enrichment in <lb/></body>

			<body>the PBSnj tail is expected, as it is enriched in natural host SIV responsive genes; but this <lb/>exercise allows us to show that in the absence of selection in natural host SIV responsive genes, <lb/>the signature of recent positive selection in eastern chimpanzees would not be exceptional. The <lb/>natural host response in vervet monkeys is associated with changes in the expression of these <lb/>natural host SIV responsive genes. In agreement with potential adaptations in gene expression, <lb/>the set of PBSnjE SNPs in the natural host SIV responsive genes is further enriched in sites <lb/>with a high likelihood having an inferred gene regulatory function (p=0.0485 when compared <lb/>with other PBSnj eastern tail genic SNPs, p=0.0089 with all genic SNPs) and strongly depleted <lb/>of sites with no predicted regulatory function (p=0.0001 when compared with other PBSnj <lb/>eastern tail genic SNPs, p=0.0001 with all genic SNPs, Supplementary file 24). While these <lb/>genes were not identified in chimpanzees, this suggests a similar mechanism of adaptation to <lb/>SIV (or to an unknown virus with a similar effect in gene expression) in vervet monkeys and <lb/>chimpanzees. <lb/>Biological functions of the PBSnj central tail SNPs <lb/>Despite having a larger long-term Ne than eastern chimpanzees, central chimpanzees do not <lb/>show a clear genomic signature of recent adaptation. Despite being naturally infected by SIV <lb/>and being the source of pandemic HIV, they show no clear indication of selection in SIV <lb/>responsive genes: the PBSnj central tail has a greater number of SNPs in SIV responsive genes <lb/>than expected (36 vs. 29), but the enrichment is non-significant (p = 0.0756; resampling test, <lb/>Table 1). Power to identify a significant enrichment may be hampered by the low number of <lb/>SNPs. However, highly differentiated SNPs in the PBSnj long branches of central chimpanzees <lb/>are significantly enriched in one GO category, &quot;chemokine receptor activity&quot;, due to SNPs in <lb/>CCR3, CCR9 and CXCR6 (p = 0.00001, FDR = 0.0197, GOWINDA). Each of these genes is <lb/>located within the large cluster of cytokine receptor genes on chromosome 3, but they appear <lb/>to be associated with different sweep events (Figure 4-supplement 3). These genes are of <lb/></body>

			<body>interest because CCR3 and CXCR6 have paralogs (CCR5 and CXCR4) that in humans are the <lb/>two most common co-receptors for HIV-1 cell entry (Berger 1997, Moore et al. 2004). Both <lb/>CCR3 and CXCR6 can be used to enter the cell by some SIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 subtypes <lb/>(Nedellec et al. 2010, Gorry et al. 2007, Bron et al. 1997, Willey et al. 2003), and the SIV of <lb/>both Sooty mangabey (Elliott et al. 2015) and Vervet monkey (Wetzel et al. 2017) use CXCR6. <lb/>The breadth of co-receptors used by SIV in chimpanzees is unknown, but sequence changes in <lb/>the V3 section of the virus can modify the specificity of the co-receptors used by HIV (Gorry <lb/>et al. 2007). We note that one of the PBSnj tail SNPs in CCR3 results in an amino acid <lb/>substitution (246 S/A) in transmembrane domain 6, and this region has been implicated in the <lb/>modulation of CCR5 activity (Steen et al. 2013). Thus, changes in these co-receptors may have <lb/>the potential to affect the entry of SIV in chimpanzee cells. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Comparing whole genomes from the four subspecies of chimpanzees we find that the alleles <lb/>whose frequency rose quickly and substantially in particular chimpanzee subspecies, resulting <lb/>in strong genetic differentiation, are enriched in genic sites. Except for eastern chimpanzees, <lb/>these genic enrichments can be explained by the effects of BGS as is the case in human <lb/>populations (Coop et al. 2009, Hernandez et al. 2011, Key et al. 2016). Our PBSnj statistic <lb/>shows that this signature in eastern chimpanzees is due to SNPs whose frequency have changed <lb/>specifically in eastern chimpanzees since their divergence with central chimpanzees. These <lb/>sites tend to have high long-range LD, but few of them have significant LD signatures of <lb/>positive selection. Many of them are polymorphic in central chimpanzees, so it is likely that <lb/>many of these adaptations have occurred from standing genetic variation and consist of soft <lb/>sweeps (Hermisson and Pennings 2017). This would suggest that adaptation from standing <lb/>genetic variation is important throughout primate evolution, not just in recent human evolution <lb/>(Pritchard, Pickrell, and Coop 2010). Alternatively, some of these sites may be polymorphic in <lb/></body>

			<body>central chimpanzees due to gene flow from eastern chimpanzees. The inferred chimpanzee <lb/>demography includes recurrent migration between eastern and central chimpanzees, in both <lb/>directions (de Manuel et al. 2016), requiring selection in eastern chimpanzees to be strong <lb/>enough to overcome the homogenising effect of gene flow. <lb/>These strongly differentiated alleles in eastern chimpanzees are enriched in sites with inferred <lb/>regulatory function, but not in sites that have been strongly constrained during mammalian <lb/>evolution. This agrees well with a role in adaptation to pathogens, which is often characterized <lb/>by fast arms-race evolution. The PBSnj eastern genes are enriched in several immune-related <lb/>categories, with many of them having known or potential virus-related functions. OAS2 and <lb/>RNASEL, for example, are involved in foreign RNA degradation (Sadler and Williams 2008), <lb/>while ERAP1 is a gene under long term balancing selection in humans (Andrés et al. 2010) that <lb/>is involved in MHC class I epitope presentation (Hearn, York, and Rock 2009). These are <lb/>plausible adaptations to viral infections in eastern chimpanzees. In fact, these PBSnj eastern <lb/>sites are located disproportionately in genes that differentiate the CD4 transcriptional response <lb/>to SIV in a natural host species that tolerates the virus from a non-natural host species that <lb/>develops immunodeficiency. Selection acting on this set of genes is sufficient to produce the <lb/>greater eastern signal. Two aspects of this enrichment are notable. First, these genes are <lb/>identified based on gene expression responses in vervet monkeys and macaques to SIV <lb/>infection (Jacquelin et al. 2014, Jacquelin et al. 2009), and are thus completely independent of <lb/>chimpanzee genetics. Second, the SIV responsive genes also show diversifying selection in <lb/>vervet monkeys (Svardal et al. 2017). Of note, these SNPs are strongly enriched in putative <lb/>regulatory functions, in agreement with putative adaptations through gene expression. This <lb/>suggests that SIV may continue to exert an important selective force in natural primate species, <lb/></body>

			<body>which both vervet monkeys and eastern chimpanzees may respond to by shaping gene <lb/>expression. <lb/>How may this happen? The genes that are both SIV-responsive and contain PBSnj eastern tail <lb/>SNPs are significantly enriched in four GO categories (FDR &lt; 0.1, GOWINDA, <lb/>Supplementary file 25). The top category is &quot;type I interferon signalling pathway with four <lb/>genes (IRF2, RNASEL, HLA-A and SP100). This category is also significantly enriched in the <lb/>full set of PBSnj eastern tail SNPs. OAS2 is also in this category but it is inducible in both <lb/>vervet and macaque shortly after SIV infection. IRF2, RNASEL and SP100 are all upregulated <lb/>in the CD4 cells of vervet monkey but not of macaques one day post infection. This is relevant <lb/>as regulation of the interferon response is a key differentiator between natural and non-natural <lb/>SIV hosts (Harris et al. 2010) and the timing of interferon responses can be key in the <lb/>progression to AIDS in humans infected with HIV (Rotger et al. 2011, Utay and Douek 2016). <lb/>Another enriched category is &quot;polycomb group (PcG) protein complex&quot;. PcG complexes can <lb/>be involved in the epigenetic regulation of HIV-1 latency (Friedman et al. 2011, Khan et al. <lb/>2018), and three of the genes in this GO category, PHC2, CBX7 and KDM2B encode <lb/>components of the same PcG complex, PCR1 (Khan et al. 2018). While in vervet monkeys <lb/>CBX7 and PHC2 are both downregulated in CD4 cells six days post infection, KDM2B is <lb/>upregulated 115 days post infection, which might hint at increased epigenetic control of SIV <lb/>in the chronic phase of infection. <lb/>Of course, it is also possible that other viruses elicited a selection response in eastern <lb/>chimpanzees, and in particular the SIV signature that we observe could be due to selection by <lb/>other ssRNA viruses. Possibilities include the viruses involved in the three significant sets of <lb/>VIPs, which are Dengue virus and the closely related Bovine leukaemia virus and human <lb/></body>

			<body>T-lymphotropic virus. Nonetheless, SIV is a better candidate to explain our observations. The <lb/>set of genes that explains the PBSnj eastern signature, the natural host SIV responsive genes, <lb/>have a clear functional, direct involvement in response to SIV virus in African primates <lb/>(Svardal et al. 2017). These genes show signatures of recent positive selection also in vervet <lb/>monkeys (Svardal et al. 2017), suggesting that SIV is an important selective force even in <lb/>natural hosts. Chimpanzees have been classically described as natural SIV hosts, but some <lb/>reports suggest fitness consequences in populations of eastern chimpanzees infected with the <lb/>virus (Keele et al. 2009), with some infected individuals described as having an AIDS-like <lb/>pathology. It thus seems likely that the virus is a selective force in this subspecies. Thus, while <lb/>we cannot be completely certain that SIV is driving selection in eastern chimpanzees, this virus <lb/>is the best candidate considering all currently available evidence. <lb/>It is also probable that eastern chimpanzees have adapted to additional selective pressures <lb/>unrelated of viral pathogens or immunity. An obvious candidate would be life history traits. <lb/>For example, the gene SKOR2, which contains the fifth ranked eastern specific missense <lb/>polymorphism, has been associated with the timing of female puberty in human GWAS of age <lb/>of menarche (Pickrell et al. 2016). Unfortunately, the genetic basis of these traits is poorly <lb/>understood making it hard to contextualise this result. <lb/>Perhaps surprisingly, central chimpanzees have weaker signatures of natural selection despite <lb/>being the subspecies with the largest Ne (de Manuel et al. 2016, Prado-Martinez et al. 2013). A <lb/>few factors could blunt the evidence for positive selection in central chimpanzees, but none of <lb/>them are able to explain the observed difference in PBSnj tail genic enrichment between central <lb/>and eastern chimpanzees -including putative population substructure, gene flow from eastern <lb/>chimpanzees or introgression from bonobos (Appendix 7). Central chimpanzees also do not <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>have significant enrichment in SIV responsive genes despite, like eastern chimpanzees, being <lb/>naturally infected by SIV (Heuverswyn et al. 2007). However, central chimpanzees exhibit a <lb/>significant enrichment of highly differentiated SNPs in the chemokine genes CCR3, CCR9 and <lb/>CXCR6, paralogs of which are involved with HIV cell entry in humans. CCR3 and CXCR6 are <lb/>used by SIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2 subtypes (Nedellec et al. 2010, Gorry et al. 2007, Bron et al. <lb/>1997, Willey et al. 2003, Wetzel et al. 2017, Elliott et al. 2015) and a SNP in CCR3 may <lb/>modulate the activity of the channel. The signature of positive selection in CXCR6 is interesting <lb/>because the SIV of natural hosts Sooty Mangabey (Elliott et al. 2015) and Vervet monkeys <lb/>(Wetzel et al. 2017) predominantly use CXCR6 for host cell entry. This is in contrast with the <lb/>dominant CCR5 usage in hosts such as humans and macaques that progress to AIDS. While it <lb/>is unclear which particular channels are used by SIV in each chimpanzee subspecies, the <lb/>evidence of selection in central chimpanzees in these receptors raises the intriguing possibility <lb/>that the two chimpanzee hosts have used strikingly distinct evolutionary responses to the virus: <lb/>limiting cell entry in central chimpanzees; modulation of gene expression response in eastern <lb/>chimpanzees. With the estimated time of infection being ~100,000 years ago, this could be due <lb/>to differential adaptation to a common selective pressure, or potential subspecies-specific <lb/>coadaptation between chimpanzee hosts and SIV. This last is an intriguing possibility that <lb/>warrants further investigation. <lb/>While our attention has focussed on eastern, and to a lesser extent, central chimpanzees, this is <lb/>not to say that positive selection has not acted on western and Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees. <lb/>Rather, what we conclude is that, as in the case of central chimpanzees, BGS under the inferred <lb/>demography of chimpanzees is adequate to explain the patterns of genetic differentiation in <lb/>these subspecies. We note however that the divergence time of these lineages makes tests of <lb/>allele frequency differentiation less well suited to identify adaptive loci than in eastern and <lb/></body>

			<body>central chimpanzees. Alternative approaches, for example using intensive within subspecies <lb/>sampling, can help identify adaptive loci in these subspecies. Nevertheless, our results show <lb/>striking differences between the sister subspecies of eastern and central chimpanzees. Besides <lb/>helping us start to identify the genetic and phenotypic differences among subspecies, this <lb/>finding highlights the need for genetic studies and conservation efforts to account for functional <lb/>differentiation between subspecies and local populations across the entire chimpanzee range. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Genotypes, haplotypes and genic regions <lb/>We analysed the 58 chimpanzee genomes described in de Manuel et. al. (2016), with sample <lb/>sizes of: eastern 19, central 18, Nigeria-Cameroon 10, western 11 after excluding the hybrid <lb/>Donald. For most tests based on allele frequencies, we used the chimpanzee VCF file from de <lb/>Manuel et al., (2016) after removing every SNP with at least one missing genotype across all <lb/>chimpanzees. For haplotype phasing, we also included the 10 bonobo genomes from (de <lb/>Manuel et al. 2016). To statistically phase haplotypes we used Beagle (Browning and Browning <lb/>2007) v 4.1 (downloaded from https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/beagle/b4_1.html, <lb/>May 2016). We used default parameters without imputation, except that after the initial 10 burn <lb/>in iterations we performed 15 phasing iterations (default is five) using the following command <lb/>line: java -Xmx12000m -jar beagle.03May16.862.jar gt=vcf out=vcf.phased impute=false <lb/>nthreads=1 niterations=15 <lb/>For the analysis of  we chose to use the homologous human genome reference allele as the <lb/>ancestral state for chimpanzee SNPs. We used the human genome from the 1000 Genomes <lb/>project <lb/>phase <lb/>III <lb/>human_g1k_v37.fasta, <lb/>available <lb/>from: <lb/>http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/human_g1k_v37.fasta.gz <lb/></body>

			<body>We used the UCSC liftover utility to convert chimpanzee SNPs&apos; coordinates from pantro 2.1.4 <lb/>to human genome version 37 (hg19) coordinates, then used samtools faidx to retrieve the <lb/>human allele for that position. <lb/>We acknowledge that some AA inferences can be incorrect due to parallel mutations in the <lb/>human lineage or lineage sorting effects. To show that our result was robust to AA inference <lb/>method, we also used the homologous gorilla allele and parsimony of both the human and <lb/>gorilla allele extracted from 20 mammalian multiz alignment to the human genome hg38, <lb/>downloaded <lb/>from <lb/>UCSC <lb/>(http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/multiz20way/maf/), and the inferred <lb/>chimpanzee ancestral allele determined calculated using the EPO alignments and downloaded <lb/>from <lb/>ENSMBL, <lb/>available <lb/>at <lb/>ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-<lb/>90/fasta/ancestral_alleles/pan_troglodytes_ancestor_CHIMP2.1.4_e86.tar.gz. Each of these <lb/>inference methods recovered the same signal of a significantly greater  tail bin genic <lb/>enrichment for eastern vs. central chimpanzees, see Supplementary file 14. Again, we also note <lb/>that our new statistic PBSnj does not require inference of the ancestral allele. <lb/>We considered protein-coding genes on the autosomes (17,530 genes) and define &apos;genic sites&apos; <lb/>by extending the transcription start and end coordinates from ENSEMBL biobank for <lb/>pantro2.1.4 by 2kb on each side. <lb/>Genetic map <lb/>For statistics that required a genetic map, we used the pan diversity genetic map (Auton et al. <lb/>2012) <lb/>inferred <lb/>from <lb/>10 <lb/>western <lb/>chimpanzees. <lb/>We <lb/>downloaded <lb/>the <lb/>chimp_Dec8_Haplotypes_Mar1_chr-cleaned.txt <lb/>files <lb/>from <lb/></body>

			<body>birch.well.ox.ac.uk/panMap/haplotypes/genetic_map. These files consist of SNPs and their <lb/>inferred local recombination rate. These map data were inferred from sequences aligned to the <lb/>pantro2.1.2 genome, so we used two successive liftover steps to convert the coordinates of sites <lb/>used to infer the genetic map to pantro2.1.4 coordinates: pantro2.1.2 to pantro2.1.3, then <lb/>pantro2.1.3 to pantro2.1.4. Two steps are required as there are no liftover chains relating <lb/>pantro2.1.2 to pantro2.1.4. Of the 5,323,278 autosomal markers, 33,263 were not lifted from <lb/>pantro2.1.2 to pantro2.1.3. The remaining 5,290,015 were also successfully converted to <lb/>pantro2.1.4 coordinates. After liftover we filtered sites that after the two steps were mapped to <lb/>unassigned scaffolds or the X chromosome, which left 5,289,844 SNPs. Next, we sorted loci <lb/>by position to correct cases where their relative order was scrambled. This left a final number <lb/>of 5,289,460 autosomal SNPs. Recombination rates were then recalculated by linear <lb/>interpolation between consecutive markers (marker x, marker y) using the average of their <lb/>estimated recombination rates (rate x, rate y). These recombination maps have been deposited <lb/>on Dryad (see Data availability). <lb/>Signed difference in derived allele frequency () <lb/>Using the derived allele frequency of each SNP for each subspecies we calculated, for each <lb/>pair of chimpanzee subspecies, the signed difference in derived allele frequency (DAF) <lb/>between them:  = DAFpop1 -DAFpop2; DAFpop1 &gt; DAFpop2 :  &gt; 0; DAFpop1 &lt; DAFpop2:  &lt; 0; <lb/>-1 &lt;=  &lt;= 1. We bin  into 10 bins of 0.2. The choice of subspecies assigned to pop1 or pop2 <lb/>is arbitrary and has no bearing on the results. To ensure that both tail bins are identically wide, <lb/>we define them as Bin 1: -1 &lt;=  &lt;= 0.8 and Bin 10 as 0.79 &lt;  &lt;= 1. As a consequence, the <lb/>Bin 5 (0.00 &lt;  &lt; 0.2) is marginally narrower than the other bins (by 0.01), but it contains a <lb/>large number of sites and the slight size difference has negligible impact on the analyses. The <lb/>derived allele counts have been deposited on Dryad (see Data availability). <lb/></body>

			<body>We estimate confidence intervals and infer p-values for  genic enrichment using a weighted <lb/>block jackknife (Reich et al. 2009) utilising the method of Busing et. al. (Busing et al. 1999). <lb/>This has been used for analogous tests, as it accounts for linkage disequilibrium, which means <lb/>that SNPs in  bins are not full independent of each other. We divide the genome into non-<lb/>overlapping 200kb windows to capture the blocking effect of LD. We then recalculate, for each <lb/>bin, the genic enrichment using a delete-1 window jackknife. We also weight the windows by <lb/>the total number of SNPs in them, to downweigh, within each bin, blocks with large numbers <lb/>of linked SNPs. We determine that two tails are differentially enriched if their 95% CIs of <lb/>enrichment do not overlap. For directly testing asymmetry (or in the case of PBSnj, equality) <lb/>using the log2 ratio, we use the same weighted block jackknife, and use the 95% CI as a two-<lb/>tailed test with alpha = 0.05. Other enrichment and resampling tests are described in Methods <lb/>subsection &quot;Statistics&quot;. <lb/>Population Branch Statistic neighbour-joining. <lb/>The Population Branch Statistic (PBS, Yi et al. 2010) is a test of population specific natural <lb/>selection. In the framework of a three-taxon distance tree, SNPs under selection specific to one <lb/>population are detected as those that result in longer than expected branch lengths (large allele <lb/>frequency differentiation). To generate the tree, for each site, the full distance matrix of <lb/>pairwise FST is computed. A three taxa tree is unrooted and has only one possible topology, so <lb/>simple algebra allows the calculation of each branch length in the tree. Extreme outliers in the <lb/>distribution of PBS are considered candidates of positive selection. <lb/>We introduce Population Branch Statistic neighbour-joining (PBSnj) as a simple method to <lb/>calculate population specific branch lengths when more than three taxa are being analysed. We <lb/>note that related Methods have recently appeared in the literature (Cheng, Xu, and DeGiorgio <lb/>2017, Racimo, Berg, and Pickrell 2018). Full details are in Appendix 4, but in brief, using the <lb/></body>

			<body>full matrix of pairwise FST, FST values are transformed to units of drift time as ln (1-FST) (Yi et <lb/>al. 2010). For fixed differences this transformation is mathematically undefined i.e. ln (0), and <lb/>FST =1 is replaced with the next largest observed FST value for a given population pair. Then <lb/>the Neighbor-Joining algorithm (Saitou and Nei 1987) is used to infer the tree topology and <lb/>calculate branch lengths. This overcomes errors in the inferred length of external branches due <lb/>to misspecification of a fixed tree topology. To enable a binning scheme of PBSnj values that <lb/>is comparable between subspecies, these scores are further normalised to be on the 0-1 scale. <lb/>These data have been deposited on Dryad (see Data availability). FST for PBSnj was calculated <lb/>using the estimator described in (Bhatia et al. 2013) because there are unequal sample sizes for <lb/>the subspecies, and the classical Weir and Cockerham estimator can be biased with unequal <lb/>sample sizes (Bhatia et al. 2013). To calculate genic enrichments along the PBSnj distribution <lb/>we bin SNPs in PBSnj bins 0.2 units wide. As for  analyses, we use the 200 kb weighted block <lb/>jack-knife to estimate confidence and significance levels. We provide a source code file, <lb/>written in R, to calculate PBSnj (&quot;PBSnj_method.R&quot;). <lb/>Model of Chimpanzee demographic history <lb/>The most detailed exploration of chimpanzee demography comes from the work of de Manuel <lb/>et. al. (2016). This paper describes the 58 chimpanzee full genome sequences we use here, and <lb/>estimation of their inferred demographic model. As this paper took a primary interest in <lb/>investigating chimpanzee-bonobo post speciation gene flow, and to reduce the number of <lb/>parameters to be estimated, models were inferred using either Nigeria-Cameroon or western <lb/>chimpanzees, but not both. Thus, de Manuel et. al. (2016) provides &quot;bonobo, eastern, central, <lb/>Nigeria-Cameroon&quot; and &quot;bonobo, eastern, central, western&quot; models. These are referred to, <lb/>respectively, as &apos;becn&apos; and &apos;becw&apos; models below. <lb/></body>

			<page>26 <lb/></page>

			<body>For this investigation we use a merged demographic history. To begin the construction of this <lb/>model, we recognised that there is little gene flow involving western chimpanzees in the &apos;becw&apos; <lb/>model, but that gene flow events are a key determinant of patterns of chimpanzee genetic <lb/>diversity and differentiation in the &apos;becn&apos; model. We therefore used the &apos;becn&apos; model as a <lb/>scaffold to which parameters relating to western chimpanzees (bottlenecks, expansions and Ne <lb/>estimates) from the &apos;becw&apos; model are &quot;grafted&quot; in, to create a merged &apos;becnw&apos; model. To make <lb/>sure that the Ne of western chimpanzees was appropriately scaled, all Nes 1000 ya pastwards <lb/>for western chimpanzees specified in the &apos;becw&apos; model were normalized by multiplying by the <lb/>ratio of the inferred Nes of central chimpanzees specified from 1000 ya pastwards in the &apos;becn&apos; <lb/>and &apos;becw&apos; models: scaled western Ne = western Ne * 3.66914400056 / 4.3158739382. Present <lb/>western Ne was normalised by the ratio of the present central Ne: scaled western Ne = western <lb/>Ne * 0.3092 / 0.30865. <lb/>Initially, we used the split time of the western and Nigeria-Cameroon lineages of 250ky <lb/>reported by de Manuel et. al. which was estimated from sequence divergence data, but this <lb/>gave a bad fit to FST values, being substantially lower than observed (Supplementary file 3). <lb/>We addressed this by increasing the western/Nigeria-Cameroon divergence time in proportion <lb/>to the ratio of model:observed western/Nigeria-Cameroon FST. i.e. FSTObserved / FSTModel = <lb/>timeX / 250kya =&gt; timeX = FSTObserved / FSTModel x 250kya. We adjust the observed FST by <lb/>-0.008 -to capture the average difference between model versus observed FST values for <lb/>central/eastern/Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees. This simple calculation results in an adjusted <lb/>time of 267kya for the western/Nigeria-Cameroon split. FST values for this new model show a <lb/>much better fit to observed values (Supplementary file 3), and it is this model that we use for <lb/>all subsequent modelling of genic enrichments and the effects of background selection. <lb/></body>

In general, the model fit is good, <lb/>being poorest for singletons (too high) and high frequency derived sites (too low). This is likely <lb/>due to effects of selection on the genome, which is not incorporated into the neutral <lb/>demographic model. We note too, that this model was computed using only the allele counts <lb/></body>

			<body>from regions of the genome under weak/no selection as inferred from GERP scores, further <lb/>explaining the reduced fit at these two site classes. <lb/>Simulations of chimpanzee genetic data under neutrality and background selection. <lb/>We used msms to perform coalescent simulations of chimpanzee demography. To simulate the <lb/>effects of background selection (BGS) we modified the estimates of effective population size <lb/>(Ne) from the demographic model by multiplying them by a scaling factor, which represents <lb/>the B score or effective reduction in Ne due to BGS. 0.8, for example, reduces the Ne and hence <lb/>expected neutral diversity to 80% the level seen for neutral sites unlinked to regions under <lb/>purifying selection (Key et al. 2016). We simulated non-genic regions with B=1, and genic <lb/>regions with various strengths of BGS. We used B in the range 1-0.8, incremented by 0.025, <lb/>with additional 0.0125 increments between 0.9 -0.85. For neutral regions and for each B we <lb/>simulated 25 million 2.0 kb loci. After processing and calculating allele frequencies, we <lb/>performed  and PBSnj genic enrichments as described previously. To estimate a BGS strength <lb/>that best matched the observed  genic enrichments, we performed a simple sum of squared <lb/>differences, summed for each  genic enrichment bin for each pairwise comparison. <lb/>Estimating the number of extra eastern chimpanzee adaptive events. <lb/>We use the structure of the block jack-knife to estimate the number of adaptive events that are <lb/>needed to result in the PBSnj eastern tail genic enrichment being greater than that of central <lb/>chimpanzees or generated by BGS. Recall that to estimate the error variance on the genic <lb/>enrichment in each bin of PBSnj, we divided the genome into non-overlapping 200 kb blocks. <lb/>For each block we have the number of genic and non-genic SNPs per bin of the PBSnj <lb/>distribution. <lb/></body>

			<page>30 <lb/></page>

			<body>For eastern chimps, there are 3475 genic SNPs contained within 842 blocks (i.e. 168 MB) in <lb/>the PBSnj rhs tail i.e. with a PBSnj scaled length &gt;= 0.8. <lb/>Of these, there are 468 blocks containing only 1 SNP i.e. 56% of blocks, 82 blocks with 10 or <lb/>more outlier genic SNPs. i.e. 10% of blocks, with a maximum block count of 111 genic SNPs <lb/>(Figure 4-figure supplement 1a). <lb/>We rank blocks by the number of genic SNPs that are outliers. Iterating over this sorted list we <lb/>remove blocks and recalculate the enrichment for genic SNPs. We define matching as the <lb/>number of iterations required to reduce the tail bin genic enrichment to below a target value. <lb/>We chose to order by the number of eastern tail genic SNPs as this results in a monotonically <lb/>decreasing genic enrichment with each block being removed. <lb/>Haplotype/LD based tests of selection <lb/>iHS is the ratio of the extended haplotype homozygosities (EHH) of derived versus ancestral <lb/>alleles at polymorphic loci. As EHH is measuring linkage disequilibrium (LD), a larger value <lb/>indicates greater LD for the derived allele. Under neutrality, derived allele frequency is <lb/>correlated with allele age, so iHS scores are standardised in bins of derived frequency. <lb/>Standardised scores have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Outliers are typically defined <lb/>as standardised iHS &gt; 2. nSL is a related statistic, but it calculates haplotype homozygosity as <lb/>the number of matching SNPs rather than genetic distance. This approach is less biased towards <lb/>regions of low recombination and is reportedly more sensitive to the detection of soft sweeps <lb/>(Ferrer-Admetlla et al. 2014). XP-EHH compares the homozygosity of focal haplotypes <lb/>between populations and we only performed XP-EHH calculations for the sister taxa: <lb/>central/eastern and Nigeria-Cameroon/western. <lb/></body>

			<body>Measures of conservation and effects on gene regulation <lb/>We used phastCons (Siepel et al. 2005) to infer highly conserved sites. We used the 20 <lb/>mammalian multiz alignment to the human genome hg38, downloaded from UCSC <lb/>(http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/multiz20way/maf/). To reduce the chance <lb/>that polymorphism in chimpanzees affects inference of conservation, we removed both the <lb/>chimp and bonobo reference genomes form these alignments. We estimated the phylogenetic <lb/>models from fourfold degenerate (nonconserved model) and codon first position sites <lb/>(conserved model). We then predicted base conservation scores and conserved fragments using <lb/>the following options: --target-coverage 0.25 --expected-length 30. Resultant conserved <lb/>elements covered 69.24% of the human exome, or an enrichment of 17.27. We note that <lb/>although we attempted to remove the Pan branch from our estimates, it is impossible to <lb/>completely avoid the use of these genomes, for example, when converting predicted conserved <lb/>elements from hg38 to pantro2.1.4. These results have been deposited on Dryad (see Data <lb/>availability). <lb/>We used regulomeDB (Boyle et al. 2012) to identify putatively regulatory role of genomic <lb/>sites. Due to the close phylogenetical relationship between chimpanzees and humans, we argue <lb/>that in lieu of any functional data for chimpanzees, inferred function from homologous <lb/>positions in the human genome is a useful proxy for function in the chimpanzee genome. To <lb/>obtain regulomeDB information for variable chimpanzee positions we used liftover to map <lb/>SNP coordinates from pantro2.1.4 to hg19, keeping positions that reciprocally mapped to <lb/>homologous chromosomes. Alan Boyle then kindly provided regulomeDB annotations for <lb/>these positions. In regulomeDB, lower scores reflect higher confidence in regulatory function. <lb/>We modified scores on the basis that scores 1a-f are given for positions that are human eQTLs, <lb/>which we do not use as they refer to the specific allele change in humans rather than to the <lb/></body>

			<page>32 <lb/></page>

			<body>function of the site. Without eQTLS, scores 1a-c and 2a-c reflect the same biochemical <lb/>signatures and location within transcription factor motifs. Thus, we combine these scores in to <lb/>a new &quot;high confident&quot; regulatory function category. Our &quot;non-regulatory&quot; category includes <lb/>positions with regulomeDB scores of 6 or 7, which have no evidence of being regulatory. We <lb/>did not use sites with intermediate scores. <lb/>Gene set enrichment analyses <lb/>We used GOWINDA (Kofler and Schlötterer 2012) to test for enrichments in Gene Ontology <lb/>(GO) categories, which corrects for clustering and gene length biases. We used either GO <lb/>categories or custom gene lists as candidate gene sets. GO categories for humans were obtained <lb/>from the GO consortium (The Gene Ontology 2017, Ashburner et al. 2000) , while gene sets <lb/>were manually created from published sets of Viral Interaction Proteins (Enard et al. 2016) and <lb/>a set of genes that are differentially expressed in CD4 cells after SIV infection in the natural <lb/>SIV host vervet monkey but not in that non-natural host macaque (Svardal et al. 2017, Jacquelin <lb/>et al. 2014, Jacquelin et al. 2009). <lb/>GOWINDA has an input file format which enables flexible usage of nonstandard gene sets. <lb/>Genes are defined in a gtf file. We created a gtf from the ENSMBLE gene definitions, but <lb/>restricted these to genes with clear 1-1 orthologs with humans. Our gtf file contained 16,198 <lb/>of 17,530 protein coding genes. This gene set has been deposited on Dryad (see Data <lb/>availability). Additional inputs are the PBSnj tail SNP set, and the background SNP set (of <lb/>which the candidates are a subset). For all gene set enrichments, the background SNPs set was <lb/>the full genome-wide set of genic variants for which PBSnj could be calculated. <lb/></body>

			<page>33 <lb/></page>

			<body>GOWINDA was designed to reduce false positives that result from gene length bias (the <lb/>probability of randomly containing an outlier SNP increases with gene length) and clustering <lb/>of genes (such as paralogs) that share function. It achieves this by using resampling of <lb/>background SNPs, which is the genome wide set of SNPs considered in a test. We use the --<lb/>mode gene switch. In this case, background SNPs are randomly sampled until the number of <lb/>overlapping genes matches the total number of genes overlapping the PBSnj tail SNP set. <lb/>Empirical p-values are estimated for each GO category, as the proportion of resamples which <lb/>contain the same or greater number of genes than the PBSnj tail SNP set, per GO category (for <lb/>each random background sample a pseudo p-value per GO category is also likewise calculated). <lb/>FDR at each p-value, p, is then estimated as the number of observed p-values less than or equal <lb/>to p, Robs, divided by the total number of resamples with a p-value less than p Rexp i.e. FDR = <lb/>Robs / Rexp. <lb/>It is important to note that only genic background SNPs that are within the candidate set of <lb/>genes (e.g. genes with GO definitions) are used in the random sampling. For the GO <lb/>enrichment, after filtering for gene sets with at least 3 genes, the GO definition file contains <lb/>definitions for 15649 genes, and 95% of genic background SNPs are used for resampling. This <lb/>is important, as therefore GOWINDA cannot be used to directly test for enrichment in a single <lb/>or small set of candidate gene sets. Providing one category, for example, would reduce the <lb/>background SNP set to only those background SNPs in the genes in that category. Resampling <lb/>can only ever return the same number of genes in this case. Thus, for VIPs and for the SIV <lb/>gene set, we included an additional category, which is the full set of genes in the gtf file (&quot;all <lb/>gene set&quot;). This has no effect on empirical p-value estimation. Its effect on FDR correction is <lb/>limited as Robs is unchanged. For a candidate p-value, the all gene set will not be lower or equal <lb/></body>

			<page>34 <lb/></page>

			<body>to it unless the candidate p-value is itself 1. Thus Robs is unchanged. The effect on Rexp is hard <lb/>to determine, but for small empirical p-values should be proportionately small. <lb/>There are 98 VIP gene sets in (Enard et al. 2016), reduced to 53 when filtered for those <lb/>containing at least 3 genes. For these and for the GO categories we used an FDR &lt; 0.1 as a cut-<lb/>off when discussing significant categories. There is only one SIV response genes set, so we <lb/>only report the empirical p-value and treat p-value &lt; 0.05 as significant. Note that this <lb/>procedure does not allow the calculation of an FDR for the SIV set, nor over the family of tests <lb/>(SIV gene set enrichment in all four subspecies) but we tested a strong a priori expectation that <lb/>given the eastern PBSnj tail genes are enriched for viral immunity genes, this would be due to <lb/>ververt SIV response genes. However, to estimate such an FDR, we used a resampling scheme: <lb/>For each gene in the genome, we assign a weight, which is the proportion of SNPs in that gene <lb/>compared to the genome as a whole. This is to correct for gene length bias. We make the <lb/>intersect of all the SIV genes in each PBSnj tail. We then do weighted resampling from all <lb/>genes in the genome to create sets of genes as large as the intersect set, and calculate an <lb/>empirical p-value for each subspecies, as defined above. These empirical p-values are highly <lb/>similar to those provided by GOWINDA, suggesting that our weighting scheme effectively <lb/>controls for gene length bias. We then calculate the FDR for each empirical p-value, with Rexp <lb/>summed over all four subspecies. <lb/>Natural Host SIV responsive genes underpin the eastern PBSnj tail genic enrichment. <lb/>We wanted to test if selection on natural host SIV responsive genes could be the reason that <lb/>Eastern chimpanzees exhibit the strongest signal of genetic adaptation. Our simple test is to <lb/>hypothetically propose that if selection had not acted on the natural host SIV responsive genes <lb/>then those genes would not contribute a SNP to the PBSnj eastern genic tail. Thus, we removed <lb/>the genic tail SNPs from the 118 genes that are natural host SIV responsive and have SNPs in <lb/></body>

			<page>35 <lb/></page>

			<body>the outlier bin of the eastern PBS scores. However, we don&apos;t remove the genic SNPs within <lb/>these genes that are in any of the other subspecies. This means we will affect the eastern genic <lb/>enrichment, but not the enrichment of other subspecies. We argue that this answers the question <lb/>&quot;what would the eastern genic enrichment be if selection had not acted on these genes in eastern <lb/>chimpanzees&quot; <lb/>Statistics <lb/>To test enrichment in LD statistics, phastCons scores and regulomeDB scores we use random <lb/>resampling tests. For a candidate set of SNPs sized n, we randomly draw the same number of <lb/>genic SNPs. For LD statistics we calculated the mean score. For phastCons and regulomeDB <lb/>we calculate the proportion of SNPs in a category. For the LD tests, all SNP scores are <lb/>normalised so that genic SNPs have mean = 0 and sd = 1, within each bin of derived allele <lb/>frequency. Thus, tail SNPs with a high score have a higher score compared to other genic SNPs <lb/>with the same derived allele frequency. <lb/>For all resampling tests, p-values are estimated as 1 + n resamples &gt;= observed (or &lt;= observed <lb/>as appropriate) / 1 + n resamples. Adding 1 to both the numerator and denominator ensures <lb/>that resampling p-values do not equal 0, which is a downward biased estimate given finite <lb/>resampling. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Appendix 1 <lb/>Signed differences in derived allele frequency () amongst human populations. <lb/>We were interested in comparing the recent adaptive history of chimpanzees and humans. <lb/>Previously (Coop et al. 2009) found that that those SNPs with the greatest allele frequency <lb/>difference between populations of modern humans were enriched for genic variants. <lb/>Subsequent work presented by (Hernandez et al. 2011) and (Key et al. 2016) replicated these <lb/>findings. To present consistent analyses and make more specific comparisons with <lb/>chimpanzees, we replicated the analyses of signed differences in derived allele frequency () <lb/>in three human populations: Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT); <lb/>British in England and Scotland (GBR). We choose JPT and GBR because their pairwise FST <lb/>is 0.10 i.e. approximately the same as for eastern and central chimpanzees. The YRI-vs. non-<lb/>African pairwise comparisons have amongst the largest FST values of all comparisons among <lb/>1000 Genomes populations, ~0.15 (data not shown). By down sampling each population to n <lb/>=10 or n = 20 individuals, we can also assess the impact of sample size, considering that the <lb/>range of chimpanzee samples is 10 -19. We used genotype data from the 1000 genomes phase <lb/>III (Genomes Project et al. 2015), without any filtering of genotypes. We used the annotated <lb/>ancestral allele in this same dataset (which are derived themselves from EPO alignments) to <lb/>polarise derived allele frequencies. <lb/>We find that sample size has moderate effects on the determination of  tail bin genic <lb/>enrichment, except for GBR vs. JPT, which have few SNPs with a large frequency difference, <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">and for which the high resolution afforded with sample n=91 is required to ascertain a <lb/>significant tail bin enrichment (Figure S1a). <lb/>When comparing the 95% confidence intervals of tail bin genic enrichments we find, consistent <lb/>with previous results, that  tail bin genic enrichments are symmetrical for human populations <lb/>when ancient DNA information is not incorporated (Key et al. 2016). This finding is consistent <lb/>across all sample sizes (Figure S1a), suggesting that sample size is not a contributor to the <lb/>stronger genic enrichment in central vs. eastern chimpanzees. <lb/>To further explore asymmetry among the genic enrichment in the two tails of , we repeat the <lb/>calculation of tail bin genic enrichment log2 ratios as in Main Text Figure 2. In nearly all cases <lb/>the enrichment is symmetric (Figure S1b). The only significant asymmetry is for an increased <lb/>genic enrichment in Yoruba vs. Japanese when the sample size is 91. We note that despite <lb/>being significant, this asymmetry is only half that observed in the comparison between eastern <lb/>chimpanzees and central chimpanzees. No human comparison thus shows signatures that <lb/>compare to those between eastern and central chimpanzees. <lb/></div>

To find the strength of BGS (measured as a B score, a fraction of <lb/>the expected neutral diversity) that could explain genic enrichments observed in chimpanzees, <lb/>we simulated 25 million 2kb loci for non-genic (B = 1) and genic regions.

			<div type="annex">combined with the observation that the best fit is B=0.925 when  tail bins are excluded <lb/>suggests positive selection is contributing to the genic enrichments in the  tails. <lb/>We also checked if a greater genic enrichment in eastern vs. central chimpanzees is expected <lb/>given the demographic history of chimpanzees and/or the effects of BGS. For each value of B <lb/>we modelled above, we also calculated the log2 ratio of the eastern and central  tail bin. <lb/>No value of B in the range 1 -0.8 results in an asymmetry in genic enrichment between eastern <lb/>and central chimpanzees as great as that observed in the genomic data (max B = 0.850, 0.103; <lb/>observed 0.34).

			<div type="annex">Appendix 3 <lb/>Evidence for, and explanatory power of, differing strengths of BGS amongst <lb/>chimpanzees. <lb/>We note first the evidence suggesting that background selection varies little among the great <lb/>apes despite their large differences in Ne (Nam et al. 2017) and despite the stronger purifying <lb/>selection in larger Ne subspecies (Bataillon et al. 2015). Background selection is expected to <lb/>reduce diversity in genic regions more than in non-genic ones by removing variants linked to <lb/>deleterious alleles, but the action of this type of selection appears independent of Ne (Nam et <lb/>al. 2017). Background selection is instead determined by the distribution of fitness effects for <lb/>deleterious alleles, which is likely similar among the great apes owing to their generally <lb/>conserved gene location and function (Nam et al. 2017). Further, simulations show that the rate <lb/>of selective sweeps explains the larger reduction of diversity around genes in species with <lb/>larger Ne (Nam et al. 2017). Thus, the diversity reducing effect of background selection should <lb/>be the same across all four chimpanzee sub-species. We tested this comparing the levels of <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">scaled neutral diversity ( / divergence to macaque) between chimpanzee sub-species as a <lb/>function of the distance to the nearest gene (normalized to the lowest diversity seen for each of <lb/>the sub-species, Appendix 3-figure 1a). We confirmed that the relative reduction in neutral <lb/>variation linked to genes is the same across sub-species (both Appendix 3-figure 1a), and that <lb/>the nucleotide distance from genes at which neutral diversity reaches equilibrium is also <lb/>similar. In addition, we find that the average genomic diversity in central, eastern and Nigeria-<lb/>Cameroon chimpanzees has similar dependency on recombination rate and density of <lb/>functional features (gene coding and gene untranslated sequences and non-coding conserved <lb/>elements (Appendix 3-figure 1b) suggesting yet again that background selection is comparable <lb/>among them. Note however that functional categories appear to be worse predictors of diversity <lb/>levels in western chimpanzees than the other subspecies (95% CI of the bootstrap distributions <lb/>of rho, the partial spearmans correlation controlling from recombination rate, do not overlap). <lb/>We have not investigated this further, but it is possibly due to the fact that the genetic map is <lb/>based on a sample of western chimpanzees, is therefore most accurate for this subspecies with <lb/>the effect of smaller residuals in the regression of diversity on recombination rate. <lb/>Lastly, we turn to a population genetic statistical model able to estimate the reduction in neutral <lb/>diversity due to background selection(Corbett-Detig, Hartl, and Sackton 2015). Full details for <lb/>this model are given in Corbett-Detig et. al. (2015), but we briefly recapitulate the main points. <lb/>The effect of BGS is estimated as the population scaled mutation rate (4Ne, ) scaled by a <lb/>parameter G, that models BGS as a local reduction in Ne with G allowed to vary in windows <lb/>along the genome in proportion to the per window fraction of functional sites. The effect of <lb/>selective sweeps or Hitch Hiking (HH) is also estimated as  divided by the population scaled <lb/>rate of sweeps, 2Nv. Following the implementation of this model by Corbett-Detig et. al. (2015) <lb/>we calculated average neutral diversity in 500 kb windows and used the number of bp in exons <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">for functional density. We ran the compute_gk package on this data to estimate the effects of <lb/>linked selection, as described by Corbett-Detig et. al. (2015). Using this model, we estimated <lb/>the same reduction in neutral diversity in each chimpanzee subspecies (11% reduction in the <lb/>highest likelihood model; Supplementary file 6), indicating equivalent levels of background <lb/>selection among sub-species. <lb/>Despite there being no evidence to suggest that there are differences in the strength of BGS <lb/>between eastern and central chimpanzees, it is useful to determine if such a putative asymmetry <lb/>in BGS strength could lead to eastern chimpanzees having a greater tail bin genic enrichment <lb/>than central chimpanzees. To investigate this possibility, we performed simulations of BGS, <lb/>where the strength of BGS was stronger in eastern chimpanzees (B = 0.825) than in all other <lb/>chimpanzees (B range: 0.900 -0.850). We find that while a greater eastern B marginally <lb/>increases the relative magnitude of eastern chimpanzee  tail bin genic enrichment, none of the <lb/>simulated ratios are within the 95% of the eastern vs. central  tail bin log2 ratio. This further <lb/>reinforces stronger BGS in eastern than in other chimpanzees would result in differences in  <lb/>tail bin genic enrichment. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Appendix 4 <lb/>Population branch statistics <lb/>In the two-population case (Pop A, Pop B), a &quot;scan&quot; for targets of population selection can be <lb/>performed by identifying outliers -e.g. the top 5% of sites -in the genome wide distribution <lb/>of per site pairwise FST values, if one assumes that these outliers are likely enriched for true <lb/>targets of positive selection (the empirical distribution could also be compared to simulated <lb/>values). As pairwise FST is a summary of the joint site frequency spectrum (SFS) of two <lb/></div>

			<page>42 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">populations, these outliers are the sites with the greatest site (allele) frequency difference. If <lb/>one considers this as an unrooted two population tree (i.e. a straight line), outliers are simply <lb/>those sites with the longest branch lengths. The problem of course is that there is no <lb/>directionality to FST, but one assumes that the population with the highest derived allele <lb/>frequency is the one in which selection has acted. <lb/>The Population Branch Statistic (PBS), introduced by (Yi et al. 2010) in their study that <lb/>identified EPAS1 as under selection in Tibetans, extends the pairwise FST case by the addition <lb/>of a third population, Pop C. PBS is a function of the three possible pairwise FST values amongst <lb/>three populations (AB, AC, and BC). As in the two-population case, there is only one unrooted <lb/>tree relating three populations, with each population connected to the central node. Therefore, <lb/>each population can be assigned a unique branch length or PBS value (Appendix 4-figure 1a). <lb/>The branch length is indicative of the population specific change in allele frequency, and targets <lb/>of positive selection can be identified as outliers. Thus, PBS overcomes the issue of assigning <lb/>directionality to allele frequency differences between populations, although with the <lb/>assumption that selection occurs in one branch only. <lb/>We wanted to analyse the joint frequency spectrum of the four chimpanzee subspecies, and <lb/>used PBS as an inspiration to develop a new statistic, PBSnj. We analyse a simple four <lb/>population model, with two groups of sister taxa A,B and C,D sharing a common ancestor <lb/>AB,CD. Split times for AB,CD, A,B and C,D are 0.2, 0.1, 0.1 scaled time units respectively, <lb/>and population size is 10e 3 throughout. We performed 2 million simulations of a 2kb locus, <lb/>with mutation rate = 1.2e -8 and recombination rate = 0.96e -8 , and sampling 50 chromosomes <lb/>per population. The msms (Ewing and Hermisson 2010) command line used is: <lb/></div>

There are three possible combinations of FST values to <lb/>calculate the branch length leading to population A: ABC, ABD, and ACD, denoted PBSABC <lb/>etc. We note that in the Tibetan PBS example, populations were chosen so that one was clearly <lb/>ancestral: Danish is the outgroup to Tibetan and Han. This highlights that while the underlying <lb/>tree is unrooted and the Tibetan branch represents allele frequency change since their split with <lb/>Han Chinese, in reality the Danish branch is a compound branch length combining branches <lb/>leading from the basal Eurasian common ancestor to the Danish and the basal Eurasian <lb/>common ancestor to the common ancestor of Tibetans and Han Chinese. In this sense, the <lb/>Danish PBS branch would not represent population specific selection events per se, and its <lb/>length is not an indication of selection events in the Danish. This indicates that the ability of <lb/>PBS to truly distinguish population specific allele frequency changes is dependent on the <lb/>configuration of populations included in its computation. To show this is true, we plot the rank <lb/>correlations of the three different PBS statistics possible for PopA. PBSABC and PBSABD are <lb/>highly correlated (spearman&apos;s rho = 0.82, Appendix 4-figure 1b) but both are poorly correlated <lb/>with PBSACD, which is a compound branch length in our model (spearman&apos;s rho = 0.46 and <lb/>0.47; PBSACD vs. PBSABC and PBSABD, Appendix 4-figure 1b). <lb/>That PBSABC and PBSABD are not perfectly correlated indicates that each contains independent <lb/>information in delimiting the branch length of PopA, and illustrates the motivation in producing <lb/>a statistic that draws upon the full four population FST matrix. <lb/></div>

			<page>44 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">In deriving this statistic, we note that PBS is just a simple algebraic function of the matrix of <lb/>pairwise FST values. To find PBSABC, for example: PBSABC = (distanceAB + distanceAC -<lb/>distanceBC)/2. An alternative method for finding distances in a phylogeny is the Neighbor-<lb/>Joining algorithm (NJ) (Saitou and Nei 1987). Without giving the full details, NJ proceeds by <lb/>calculating a Q matrix from the input distance matrix, creating a node by grouping the two taxa <lb/>with the smallest Q, and re-calculating distances with respect to the new node. In this sense, <lb/>branch lengths are a by-product of the NJ procedure, but nonetheless, by recording these branch <lb/>lengths for each SNP NJ tree across the genome, we can generate a distribution of branch <lb/>lengths analogous to PBS. For this reason, we name this proposed statistic PBSnj. While the <lb/>details and actual distances calculated differ, PBS and PBSnj both define a distance for each <lb/>branch in a tree, and the correlation between three-population PBS and PBSnj branch lengths <lb/>suggests that these two methods are near identical in their results (spearman&apos;s rho = 0.995). <lb/>Extending PBS to more than three populations require fixing a topology. In the four population <lb/>case, branch length A could be calculated as: PBSABCD = (PBSABC + PBSABD) / 2, but this <lb/>assumes that the tree at each site follows the species tree ((A,B), (C,D)). It also &quot;hides&quot; the <lb/>presence of an internal branch implicit in a bifurcating four taxa tree. While more complicated <lb/>sets of algebraic functions could be combined to solve this or other conundrums, it is enough <lb/>to point out that nj does not assume a topology (it is after all a topology finder) and that its <lb/>algebraic rules are consistent no matter the number of taxa, the only change being the number <lb/>of repetitions of the algorithm. Thus, we conclude that PBSnj is the more natural method to <lb/>use. Lastly, while we have not considered it here, in theory PBSnj is extendable to any number <lb/>of taxa. <lb/>We also do not consider the internal branch as in this investigation we are only interested in <lb/>the selection pressures that differentiate extant populations of chimpanzees. Furthermore, <lb/></div>

			<page>45 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">interpretation of the direction of the internal branch in the four taxa case relies again on <lb/>assuming that the derived allele is the target of selection. <lb/>The schematic for calculating PBSnj is as follows: <lb/>1. for each site, calculate the full FST matrix. <lb/>2. apply the Neighbor-Joining algorithm on the FST matrix, i.e. generate a nj-tree. <lb/>3. for each site, record the branch length for each taxa in the nj-tree. <lb/>Following the original description of PBS (Yi et al. 2010), we transform the FST values into <lb/>units of drift time: -ln(1-FST). As this is undefined for FST == 1, we substitute FST == 1 for the <lb/>next lowest possible pairwise FST value. So that branch lengths exhibit the same range, <lb/>following (Malaspinas et al. 2016) we standardised branch lengths by the total length of the <lb/>tree, e.g. PBSnjA_scaled = PBSnjA / (1 + PBSnjA+ PBSnjB + PBSnjC + PBSnjD + PBSnjINTERNAL). <lb/>Lastly to perform genic enrichment tests analogous to derived allele frequency difference we <lb/>re-scale so that values are within the range 0-1. This implies values of PBSnj &gt;= 0.8 (which <lb/>we use as our cut-off or PBSnj genic tail bin) are those equal to 80% or more of the max <lb/>possible values of PBSnj, are not a quantile cut-off and can therefore contain a differing number <lb/>of sites per taxa. <lb/>As a simple illustration of the effectiveness of PBSnj to identify population specific changes <lb/>in allele frequency, we asked how well the statistics identify Pop A specific allele frequency <lb/>change. We plot the derived allele frequency in each of Pops A-D, for those sites for which <lb/>PBSnjA_scaled &gt;= 0.8 (Appendix 4-figure 1c). As a comparison, we do the same for PBSABC, <lb/>PBSABD and PBSACD. PBSnjA clearly delineates those sites specifically differentiated in Pop A. <lb/>PBSACD is the worst test statistic, as Pop B allele frequencies are nearly uniformly distributed <lb/>in the range of 0-1 despite these sites being identified as pop A outliers. PBSABC and PBSABD <lb/></div>

			<page>46 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">offer a substantial improvement, but note there is a tendency for a more uniform distribution <lb/>of allele frequencies in the population not included in the calculation of PBSABC and PBSABD <lb/>(D and C respectively). Note too, the point masses near 0 for Pop A, and near 1 for Pops B-D <lb/>in PBSnjA_scaled which represent those sites where PopA has a very low derived allele frequency <lb/>i.e. are ancestral allele outliers. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Appendix 5 <lb/>The relationship between divergence times and N e and the effects of BGS. <lb/>Demography varies greatly amongst the chimpanzee sub-species, with a wide range of pairwise <lb/>divergence times and effective population sizes Ne (see Main Figure 1). This means that the <lb/>total genetic drift between, for example, Western and Central chimpanzees is much greater <lb/>than that between Central and Eastern chimpanzees. It is unknown how these differences in <lb/>drift times effects genic enrichments in bins of either the signed differences in derived allele <lb/>frequency () or PBSnj. To explore this, we again used a simple four population model <lb/>(described Appendix 4). To model the effect of background selection (BGS) we can scale Ne <lb/>by a value B, such that B= 0.9, for example, represents BGS that reduces linked neutral <lb/>diversity by 10%. Genic regions were simulated using B = 0.9. We also allowed either the basal <lb/>split time, or the split time of pop1 and pop2 to increase, therefore widening the range of <lb/>divergence times. <lb/>For each scenario, we simulated 50 chromosomes per deme for a 2kb locus, for 2 million <lb/>replicates, using a mutation rate of 1.2 x 10 -8 and recombination rate of 0.96 x 10 -8 . <lb/>The effect of divergence time and N e on  tail bin SNP n. <lb/></div>

			<page>47 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">Increasing the divergence time increases the number of SNPs in both genic and non-genic tail <lb/>bins, as is expected due to a greater variance in allele frequency due to genetic drift. While <lb/>intuitive, it is important to demonstrate as it shows that the number of SNPs in tail bin is not <lb/>itself an indication of the statistical support for selection. Increasing divergence time also <lb/>reduces the genic:non-genic SNP n ratio: from ~1.5 at time = 0.1 down to ~1.08 at time = 0.4. <lb/>Changes in Ne also greatly affect the number of  tail bin SNPs. We varied the simulated <lb/>PopB:PopA ratio to be either 0.9, 0.5 or 0.1. On this time scale, an Ne ratio of 0.9 has a modest <lb/>impact on the number of Pop2 tail bin SNPs. However, ratios of 0.5 and 0.1 result in a dramatic <lb/>increase in both Pop2 genic and non-genic tail bin SNPs. Of course, this mirrors the result of <lb/>increasing divergence time -for the same evolutionary time, lower Ne results in greater drift. <lb/>What is also apparent is that that the lowered Pop2 Ne also results in an increase in the Pop1  <lb/>tail bin counts. When Pop2 Ne = 0.1, the ratio of genic to non-genic  tail SNPs is ~ 1 for both <lb/>populations. We posit that these two factors -increased divergence and lower effective <lb/>population size -explain the lower genic enrichments seen for  calculated with western <lb/>chimpanzees. A secondary point is the implication that the genic enrichment produced by a <lb/>given strength of BGS decreases with drift time. <lb/>The effect of divergence time and N e on PBSnj tail bin genic enrichment <lb/>Divergence time and Ne impact  tail genic enrichment of both populations. This is because it <lb/>conflates allele frequency change occurring in two populations. In contrast, PBSnj is able to <lb/>determine the allele frequency change that occurs specifically in one branch of a phylogeny. <lb/>To show the effect of Ne on the PBSnj tail genic enrichment, we plot the genic enrichment <lb/>assuming BGS of B =0.9 but varying the Ne of Pop2 (Appendix 5-figure 1). Given a relative <lb/>Ne = 1, the genic enrichment in the PBSnj tail bin = 1.20, and there is no effect in reducing the <lb/></div>

			<page>48 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">Ne to 0.9 (Appendix 5-figure 1). Below Ne = 0.9, the genic enrichment drops precipitously to <lb/>1.16 for Ne = 0.5 and 1.06 for Ne = 0.1. We suggest that this shows that BGS has a greater <lb/>impact when divergence times are shorter and Ne relatively large, that is when most of the <lb/>variation between lineages is still segregating. Longer divergence times and lower Ne results <lb/>in a greater number of fixed differences between lineages, and BGS does not impact the <lb/>divergence in genic regions to the extent that it reduces diversity and distorts the SFS of <lb/>segregating variation. <lb/>This result is the motivation for comparing only central and eastern chimpanzee PBSnj tail <lb/>genic enrichments. Not only is their pairwise divergence time the lowest amongst the <lb/>chimpanzees, but given their relative Ne, we would not expect Ne to be the reason that eastern <lb/>chimpanzees exhibit a greater PBSnj tail genic enrichment. Indeed, simulations recapitulating <lb/>the demographic history of chimpanzees suggest that BGS produces equal genic enrichments <lb/>for eastern and central chimpanzees. As well as expecting a similar level of drift in each of <lb/>their branches, given a constant rate of adaptive evolution, we would also expect a similar <lb/>number of adaptive events to contribute to the genic enrichment. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Appendix 6 <lb/>Estimating the strength of background selection required to explain PBSnj tail genic <lb/>enrichments in chimpanzees. <lb/>We also determined how background selection can affect the PBSnj statistic amongst <lb/>chimpanzees and found that they each have a unique value of B which best explains their PBSnj <lb/>tail bin genic enrichment. We explain this by positive selection differentially influencing the <lb/>tail of each species, as we do not expect (Nam et al. 2017) or observe differences in the effects <lb/></div>

			<page>49 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">of background selection across species. However, only eastern chimpanzees require a B <lb/>stronger than 0.888 to achieve the observed PBSnj tail genic enrichment. <lb/>Of critical importance for interpreting the greater PBSnj tail genic enrichment for eastern <lb/>compared to that for central chimpanzees is the observation that across all values of B tested, <lb/>simulated genic enrichments are approximately identical for these two subspecies (Figure 4-<lb/>supplement 2b). Thus, demography and BGS should not produce the observed pattern. Results <lb/>from our generalised four population model also indicate that the relatively small difference <lb/>between eastern and central Ne are also not a likely explanation. In fact, such differences should <lb/>result in a higher enrichment for central chimpanzees who have the larger Ne. We again posit <lb/>that this is evidence for a greater rate of adaptive events along the eastern branch than that for <lb/>the central branch. <lb/>In contrast, for any given strength of BGS, the simulated eastern and central genic enrichments <lb/>are always greater than those of western and Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees. Our explanation <lb/>for this is as follows: most tail SNPs for Nigeria-Cameroon, and especially for western <lb/>chimpanzees, are actually fixed differences to all other chimpanzees. On the other hand, most <lb/>eastern and central PBSnj tail SNPs are polymorphisms shared between these two sub-species. <lb/>In addition, results from our general four population model, indicate that by increasing the <lb/>lineage specific drift by increasing divergence time and/or decreasing Ne, the genic enrichment <lb/>caused by BGS decreases. Again, we suggest that this indicates that BGS is more important for <lb/>polymorphism than divergence. Finally, we conclude that only the eastern vs. central PBSnj <lb/>tail bin comparison is informative in judging the significance of the eastern PBSnj tail genic <lb/>enrichment or the likelihood that this can be explained by BGS. <lb/></div>

			<div type="annex">Appendix 7 <lb/>Demography and the evidence of positive selection in central chimpanzees <lb/>We use this section to also discuss the factors that could blunt the evidence for positive <lb/>selection in central chimpanzees. Population structure within the sampled central chimpanzees <lb/>could reduce the apparent number of highly differentiated alleles. Fixed beneficial alleles in <lb/>two divergent central chimpanzee populations would, for example, look to be segregating at <lb/>intermediate frequencies if these were both sampled equally. Population structure within <lb/>chimpanzee subspecies has been extensively analysed by both (Prado-Martinez et al. 2013) <lb/>and (de Manuel et al. 2016). de Manuel et. al. (2016) present the results of numerous analyses <lb/>within their supplementary material, including results from sNMF (Frichot et al. 2014), <lb/>fineSTRUCTURE (Lawson et al. 2012), and ADMIXTURE (Alexander, Novembre, and <lb/>Lange 2009) (respectively figures S11, S13 and S14 in de Manuel et. al. (2016)). For each of <lb/>these analyses, there is less structuring of the sampled central chimpanzees compared to the <lb/>sampled eastern chimpanzees, which in contrast often appear as a cline of variation from <lb/>Tanzania and the south of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) through to Uganda <lb/>and northern DRC. This suggests that unaccounted-for population structure is not a reason for <lb/>weaker genic enrichment of differentiated alleles in central chimpanzees. <lb/>Another possible blunting mechanism is gene flow. When simulating neutral evolution and <lb/>BGS, we used coalescent simulations using demographic parameters previously described in <lb/>de Manuel et. al. (2016). This model includes inferred gene flow amongst Pan lineages, <lb/>including that of the bonobo -central chimpanzee introgression. However, what these <lb/>simulations do not address is the possibility that alleles selected in central chimpanzees were <lb/>constantly stopped from reaching fixation due to the introduction of bonobo alleles until <lb/>cessation of this gene flow ~40 kya. We note first, that gene flow is a general barrier to local <lb/></div>

			<page>51 <lb/></page>

			<div type="annex">adaptation, and that the rate of migration and strength of selection are the two key parameters <lb/>determining the likelihood of reaching fixation. If gene flow into central chimpanzees was too <lb/>great or selection too weak, then this could reduce the genic enrichment in population specific, <lb/>highly differentiated alleles -but this would reflect the biological reality of reduced local <lb/>adaptation in this subspecies. Secondly, we highlight that while bonobo introgression into <lb/>central chimpanzees did occur, the scale of this gene flow is dwarfed by the ongoing, and near <lb/>symmetrical, gene flow between central and eastern chimpanzees (migration into central <lb/>chimpanzees from bonobo was ~ 1.6% of the ongoing rate from eastern chimpanzees, and ~ <lb/>1.9% of the ongoing rate of migration from central into eastern chimpanzees). These rates of <lb/>migration would pose a greater barrier to adaptive population differentiation, and the signal in <lb/>eastern chimpanzees is identified despite this. <lb/></div>

This results in a monotonically decreasing genic enrichment, and <lb/>the removal of eight blocks is required to reduce the genic enrichment of the PBSnj eastern tail <lb/>to overlap the 95% CI of the PBSnj central tail, and 19 blocks to reduce it below the level of <lb/>the point estimate of the central PBSnj tail.

			<body>estimated range of sweeps to 15-26. But we note that the genic enrichment does monotonically <lb/>decrease with block removal (c). This is partly due to the arbitrary nature of the definition of <lb/>genic, as it implies that there are some 200 kb blocks that have more non-genic than genic <lb/>outlier SNPs contained within them, and this may very well change if the definition of genic <lb/>was changed from transcription start and end sites +-2kb. (d) Lastly, we randomly shuffled <lb/>the removal order of the 200-kb blocks. We did so for 1000 random shuffles of the block order <lb/>(A single random shuffle is shown). We find that the median number of blocks (i.e. sweeps) <lb/>across random shuffles is 165 to match the upper 95% CI of the central chimpanzee estimate <lb/>(middle 90% quantile range 114-221; min = 78, max = 278) increased to 273 to match the <lb/>central chimpanzee point estimate of genic enrichment (middle 90% quantile range 214-329; <lb/>min = 162, max = 381). Such a procedure is likely an overestimate, as most of the removal <lb/>steps are those removing 1 to 9 genic outlier SNPs (panel a), resulting in minimal reduction of <lb/>the genic enrichment. <lb/>Figure 4-figure supplement 2: Scaled PBSnj bin genic enrichment for all chimpanzee <lb/>subspecies. <lb/>a, X-axes: PBS scaled to take values in the range 0 -1, per subspecies.
