			<front>Expression of segment polarity genes in brachiopods <lb/>supports a nonsegmental ancestral role of engrailed for <lb/>bilaterians <lb/>Bruno C. Vellutini 1 and Andreas Hejnol 2* <lb/>1,2 Sars International Centre for Marine Molecular Biology, University of Bergen, <lb/>Thorm√∏hlensgate 55, 5008 Bergen, Norway. <lb/>1 Email: bruno.vellutini@uib.no <lb/>2 Email: andreas.hejnol@uib.no <lb/>* Corresponding author. <lb/>Keywords: Brachiopoda, larvae, segmentation, boundary, engrailed, wnt1, hedgehog, <lb/>pax6, pax2/5/8 <lb/> Abstract <lb/>Brachiopods are benthic marine invertebrates that live enclosed in a bivalved shell. <lb/>Despite having a reduced and unsegmented trunk in the adult stage, brachiopod larvae <lb/>show putative segmented structures such as transverse ectodermal boundaries and <lb/>iterated coelomic sacs. Several molecular mechanisms of segmentation have been <lb/>described in animals considered to be segmented (i.e., the distantly related annelids, <lb/>arthropods and vertebrates), but far less is known about the role of these &quot;segmenta-<lb/>tion genes&quot; in other organisms. Here we investigate the expression of the arthropod <lb/>segment polarity genes engrailed, wnt1 and hedgehog in the development of bra-<lb/>chiopods-a group more closely related to the segmented annelids. Expression of <lb/>engrailed correlates with the development of an anterior nonsegmental ectodermal <lb/>boundary in the embryos of Terebratalia transversa and Novocrania anomala. Sur-<lb/>prisingly, wnt1 is expressed as a stripe adjacent to engrailed in T. transversa in the <lb/>same manner as in the parasegment boundaries of insects. Expression of hedgehog, <lb/>however, is restricted to the endoderm and is not compatible with a segment polarity <lb/>role. In addition, the putative engrailed regulators pax6 and pax2/5/8 encircle the <lb/>whole embryo and demarcate this anterior ectodermal boundary before engrailed. We <lb/>conclude brachiopod larvae might have a common anterior patterning involving the <lb/>expression of pax6, pax2/5/8 and engrailed. Despite key differences to other segment <lb/>boundaries (e.g., hedgehog expression), we show the characteristic adjacent stripes of <lb/>engrailed and wnt1 can occur in a nonsegmental ectodermal boundary. A comparison <lb/>among bilaterians suggests the ancestral expression of engrailed during early develop-<lb/>ment was nonsegmental and conceivably related to the embryonic head/trunk bound-<lb/>ary. Our data implies that engrailed was independently recruited to the segment <lb/>boundaries of annelids and arthropods and to other different developmental bound-<lb/>aries during evolution. <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>Animals with bilateral symmetry show a great diversity of serially repeated structures <lb/>along the body. Neural ganglia, excretory organs, coeloms, and a variety of other tis-<lb/>sues can be individually arranged in a serial manner or combined into repetitive body <lb/>segments. The repetition of parts with anteroposterior polarity along the body axis is a <lb/>defining characteristic of animal segmentation (Budd 2001; Hannibal &amp; Patel 2013; <lb/>Minelli &amp; Fusco 2004). Groups like annelids (e.g., earthworms), arthropods (e.g., <lb/>insects) and vertebrates (e.g., humans) segment their embryonic tissues from anterior <lb/>to posterior and have a major part of their adult body organized into repeated units. <lb/>Therefore, these groups have been the main focus of studies on the evolution of seg-<lb/>mentation. <lb/>Comparative developmental data revealed a number of similarities in the molecular <lb/>mechanisms of segmentation between arthropods and vertebrates (Damen 2007; <lb/>Davis &amp; Patel 1999; Kimmel 1996; Patel 2003; Seaver 2003; Tautz 2004), that were <lb/>taken as evidence to support the homology of bilaterian segmentation (De Robertis <lb/>1997, 2008; Dray et al. 2010; Kimmel 1996). However, annelids, arthropods and ver-<lb/>tebrates belong to distinct branches of bilaterally symmetrical animals, spiralians, <lb/>ecdysozoans and deuterostomes, respectively (Figure 1A), suggesting alternatively <lb/>that these molecular similarities are evolutionary convergences (Abouheif et al. 1997; <lb/>Chipman 2010; Minelli &amp; Fusco 2004). The sole comparison between such distantly <lb/>related groups can be misleading for tracing the evolution of a character (e.g., trunk <lb/>segmentation) because the ancestral conditions of related taxa are unknown. Since <lb/>developmental mechanisms can be coopted to nonhomologous structures (Shubin et <lb/>al. 2009), knowing the phylogenetic context of a character is essential to distinguish <lb/>homology from convergence. Furthermore, segmentation is not restricted to annelids, <lb/>arthropods and vertebrates. It also occurs in other bilaterians usually considered as <lb/>pseudosegmented or unsegmented (Budd 2001; Minelli &amp; Fusco 2004; Scholtz 2002). <lb/>To fully understand the conservation of gene networks in the evolution of segmenta-<lb/>tion, it is important to uncover the expression and role of genes guiding body segmen-<lb/>tation of annelids, arthropods and vertebrates in the development of other animals, as <lb/>well as to understand their relationship to other serially repeated structures. <lb/>A crucial mechanism of segmentation is the ability to establish tissue boundaries dur-<lb/>ing animal development (Dahmann et al. 2011). One of the best studied developmen-<lb/>tal boundaries are the parasegmental boundaries of the fruit fly Drosophila <lb/>melanogaster. Fly segmentation occurs by the simultaneous division of the trunk into <lb/>fourteen parasegments, developmental regions that lie out of register with the larval <lb/>segments (Martinez-Arias &amp; Lawrence 1985). At the molecular level, the parasegment <lb/>boundary is established by the abutting domains of engrailed (en) and wingless (wnt1) <lb/>(Ingham et al. 1988) and maintained by a positive feedback loop mediated by hedge-<lb/>hog (hh) (Ingham &amp; Martinez Arias 1992). Therefore, en, wnt1 and hh are commonly <lb/>referred to as segment polarity genes (Ingham 1991; Martinez Arias et al. 1988; <lb/>Tabata &amp; Kornberg 1994), and their expression and function seems to be conserved <lb/>among the body segments of other arthropods (Damen 2007; Hughes &amp; Kaufman <lb/>2002; Mellenthin et al. 2006; Nagy 1994). Similarity in the expression of segment <lb/>polarity genes was used to claim homology of arthropod and annelid segmentation <lb/>(Dray et al. 2010; Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003), however their role in annelids is unclear. <lb/>In Platynereis dumerilii, the expression of en, wnt1 and hh supports a role in estab-<lb/></body>

			<body>lishing the segment boundaries of this animal (Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003), whereas <lb/>other annelid species do not show a spatial correlation of these genes with the seg-<lb/>mental boundaries (Seaver &amp; Kaneshige 2006). Thus, it is of utmost importance to <lb/>investigate the segment polarity genes in groups closely related to annelids and arthro-<lb/>pods to infer their ancestral developmental functions, and verify if similar expression <lb/>patterns are deployed in different morphological structures. <lb/>Brachiopods are bivalved marine invertebrates closely related to annelids (Laumer et <lb/>al. 2015) (Figure 1A). Even though adult brachiopods do not have a segmented trunk, <lb/>the larval stages of different groups show putative repeated structures in different <lb/>parts of their body. Externally, brachiopod larvae exhibit two to four lobes along the <lb/>anteroposterior axis divided by transverse ectodermal boundaries. In the past, brachio-<lb/>pod larval lobes were homologized to annelid segments (Balfour 1880), but the obser-<lb/>vation that the ectodermal boundaries do not involve the underlying mesoderm weak-<lb/>ened this hypothesis (Conklin 1902). Mesoderm morphology, however, is variable <lb/>between brachiopod species, and can be unsegmented or indeed partitioned into two <lb/>or four pairs of coelomic sacs (Hyman 1959; Nielsen 1991). The existence of brachio-<lb/>pod larvae with serially arranged mesodermal coelomic sacs has revived the idea that <lb/>brachiopods had a segmented ancestor (Balavoine &amp; Adoutte 2003; Temereva &amp; <lb/>Malakhov 2011). Therefore, the putative segmentation of brachiopod larvae is key to <lb/>comprehend the evolution of segmentation mechanisms because it provides a closer <lb/>phylogenetic comparison for the role of the segment polarity genes in the annelids. <lb/>To investigate the developmental and molecular background of the repeated structures <lb/>of brachiopod larvae, we studied the trilobed larva with unsegmented mesoderm of <lb/>Terebratalia transversa (John A. Long and Stephen A. Stricker 1991) (Figure 1B), <lb/>and the bilobed larva with four pairs of coelomic sacs of Novocrania anomala (Free-<lb/>man 2000; Nielsen 1991) (Figure 1B). In these two species of brachiopods, we ana-<lb/>lyzed the expression of the segment polarity genes en, wnt1, and the core components <lb/>of the Hedgehog signaling pathway to test whether their expression correlate with the <lb/>development of the ectodermal and mesodermal boundaries of T. transversa and N. <lb/>anomala larvae. Furthermore, we examined upstream control genes of en and discov-<lb/>ered unexpected similarities in the molecular profile of a brachiopod larval lobe <lb/>boundary and a vertebrate brain boundary. <lb/>Results <lb/>Ectodermal and mesodermal boundaries of larval brachiopods <lb/>In T. transversa, gastrulation occurs by invagination and results in a radially symmet-<lb/>ric gastrula (Figure 2A). After anteroposterior axis elongation (Figure 2B), the <lb/>embryos adopt the definitive bilateral morphology (Figure 2C). At this stage, a trans-<lb/>verse ectodermal furrow (indentation of the epidermis) appears around the circumfer-<lb/>ence of the bilateral gastrula extending from the blastopore lips above the midline to <lb/>most of the dorsal side (Figure 2C; Figure 3A). Epidermal cells abutting the posterior <lb/>border of the furrow are more elongated along the furrow outline when compared to <lb/>the isodiametric shape of anterior and posterior cells (Figure 3B). The ectodermal fur-<lb/>row at the bilateral gastrula is the first morphological manifestation of the boundary <lb/>between the apical and mantle lobes in T. transversa (apical/mantle boundary). At <lb/>subsequent developmental stages, this furrow deepens and clearly divides the apical <lb/>lobe from the remainder of the embryo (Figure 2D; Figure 3C,D). T. transversa <lb/>exhibits a third lobe at the posterior end, the pedicle lobe (Figure 2E). The boundary <lb/></body>

			<body>between the mantle and pedicle lobes (mantle/pedicle boundary) is identified by the <lb/>narrowing of the posterior portion of the embryo (Figure 2D) and by the subsequent <lb/>outgrowth of the mantle lobe (Figure 2E). The morphology of the mantle/pedicle <lb/>boundary differs from the apical/mantle boundary because it is demarcated by an <lb/>ectodermal fold, rather than an indentation furrow. Thus, despite the superficial <lb/>impression of ectodermal segmentation in the brachiopod trilobed larva, these bound-<lb/>aries are not repeated, but unique structures of the larval body. N. anomala also gas-<lb/>trulates by invagination and elongates along the anteroposterior axis (Figure 2F-H). <lb/>Its apical and mantle lobes are demarcated by an ectodermal furrow, as seen in T. <lb/>transversa (Figure 2H-J; Figure 3E-G), but the larva of N. anomala does not form a <lb/>pedicle lobe (Figure 2J; Figure 3H). Thus, the morphology of the apical/mantle <lb/>boundary is conserved between both species suggesting it is an ancestral feature of <lb/>larval brachiopods. <lb/>In the trilobed larva of T. transversa, the mesoderm is unsegmented and has a distinct <lb/>anterior portion in the apical lobe, an umbrella-like mesoderm in the mantle lobe con-<lb/>nected to the chaetae sacs and, finally, an arrowhead-shaped pedicle portion (Figure <lb/>3I-L). Unlike T. transversa, the mesoderm of N. anomala has lateral constrictions <lb/>individualizing each of the four pairs of coelomic sacs (Figure 3M) while remaining <lb/>interconnected more medially in the ventral side (Figure 3N). From the second, third <lb/>and fourth coelomic pouches we observe dorsal projections of the mesoderm associ-<lb/>ated to the three pairs of chaetae sac primordia (Figure 3N,O). In the bilobed larva, <lb/>this arrangement is compacted and an extensive musculature develops; coelomic spa-<lb/>ces are reduced (Figure 3O,P). Thus, the segmented appearance of N. anomala meso-<lb/>derm is related to its partitioning into coelomic sacs with tight association to the seri-<lb/>ated chaetae sacs on the dorsal side. <lb/>Expression of the segment polarity genes hh, en and wnt1 <lb/>In order to understand the developmental and phylogenetic relationship of the ecto-<lb/>dermal and mesodermal boundaries of brachiopods with those of the body segments <lb/>of arthropods and annelids, we analyzed the expression of the segment polarity genes <lb/>en, wnt1 and hh during the embryonic development of T. transversa and N. anomala. <lb/>Expression of hh localizes to the blastoporal lip and invaginating endomesoderm dur-<lb/>ing the early gastrulation of T. transversa (Figure 4A1); in later stages it is restricted <lb/>to the endoderm (Figure 4A2-A4). In N. anomala, we detected a transverse ventral <lb/>stripe of hh near the animal pole and (additionally) along the blastoporal lip at the <lb/>asymmetric gastrula (Figure 4B1). Endodermal transcripts only became visible at the <lb/>bilateral gastrula (Figure 4B2). The anterior ventral stripe of hh expression in N. <lb/>anomala is reduced and disappears in the bilobed larva while endodermal transcripts <lb/>continue to be expressed (Figure 4B3-B4). Therefore, the expression of hh orthologs <lb/>in T. transversa and N. anomala does not correlate spatially or temporally with the <lb/>development of the ectodermal larval lobe boundaries. <lb/>Since the Hedgehog ligand can signal across embryonic layers, we further analyzed <lb/>the expression of the Hedgehog receptors ptc and smo and the transcription factor gli. <lb/>Transcripts are expressed in the mesoderm of T. transversa and N. anomala, as well as <lb/>in the ectodermal apical and mantle territories (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Alto-<lb/>gether, the expression of hh and downstream pathway components does not support a <lb/>connection of this signaling pathway with the ectodermal boundaries of both brachio-<lb/>pod species. <lb/></body>

			<body>Transcripts of T. transversa en were first detected in the radial gastrula as an almost <lb/>complete ring in the midregion of the embryo (Additional file 2: Figure S2A). Expres-<lb/>sion fades at the anterior end and subsequently clears from the posterior end leaving a <lb/>pair of lateral domains of en in the late radial gastrula (Additional file 2: Figure S2A-<lb/>H) and asymmetric gastrula (Figure 4C1). These domains extend ventrally and dor-<lb/>sally without reaching the blastopore on the ventral side (Figure 4C2). Transcripts of <lb/>en border the apical/mantle furrow in the subsequent stage (Figure 4C3) and fade in <lb/>the developed larvae (Figure 4C4). In N. anomala a single dorsal ectodermal stripe of <lb/>en expression occurs in the radial gastrula (Additional file 2: Figure S2I) and a second <lb/>stripe emerges at the posterior end of the asymmetric gastrula (Figure 4D1; Additional <lb/>file 2: Figure S2J). Similar to T. transversa, en stripes extend ventrally without reach-<lb/>ing the embryo midline (Figure 4D1-D3) and fade in the developed larva (Figure D4). <lb/>Therefore, expression of en is consistent between the two species, with the <lb/>apical/mantle furrow forming immediately anterior to a pair of en stripes. <lb/>In addition to the striped domains demarcating the apical/mantle furrow, we identified <lb/>two more posterior en territories on the ventral and dorsal regions of larval bra-<lb/>chiopods, localized in the anterior-most region of the pedicle lobe. A pair of en ecto-<lb/>dermal bands initiate on the ventral side of T. transversa associated with the blasto-<lb/>pore (Figure 4C2). On the opposite side, at the center of the dorsal surface, we <lb/>detected a triangular-shaped domain of en expression (Figure 4C2; Additional file 2: <lb/>Figure S2N-O). Expression is still present in the trilobed larva of T. transversa (Fig-<lb/>ure 4C4). A reciprocal dorsal domain also occurs in N. anomala bilateral gastrula <lb/>(Additional file 2: Figure S2K) and localizes to the shell rudiment in the bilobed larva <lb/>(Additional file 2: Figure S2L,M). <lb/>Until the asymmetric gastrula, transcripts of en in T. transversa are restricted to the <lb/>ectoderm (Figure 4C1,G). Mesodermal expression of en only initiates at the bilateral <lb/>gastrula (Figure 4C2,H). A thin line of en-expressing cells suggests contiguous <lb/>expression between ectoderm and mesoderm (Figure 4C2,J). Transcripts of en form a <lb/>pair of mesodermal bands posterior to the ventral projections of the mantle mesoderm <lb/>(Figure 4I,K,L). In the asymmetric gastrula of N. anomala we only detected weak en <lb/>expression in the mesoderm (Figure 4M). Expression of en becomes stronger localiz-<lb/>ing directly inner to the lateral ectodermal domains (Figure 4N). This region corre-<lb/>sponds to the posterior portion of the second pair of coelomic pouches. Transcripts of <lb/>en are also detected in the posterior region of the third pair of coeloms in the bilobed <lb/>larva, but not in the first or fourth coelomic sacs (Figure 4O-R). Expression in the <lb/>second coelomic sac localizes to the medial portion of the mesoderm (Figure 4P,Qi) <lb/>while the expression in the third coelomic sac is more lateral and ventral (Figure 4P <lb/>inset, Qii). Overall, the mesodermal expression of en occurs in contiguity with the <lb/>preceding ectodermal domains in both species. <lb/>Expression of wnt1 in the asymmetric gastrula of T. transversa is associated with the <lb/>posterior portion of the blastopore (Figure 4E1) and shows no spatial correlation to <lb/>the lateral en domains (Figure 5A). At the bilateral gastrula, a transverse pair of <lb/>stripes of wnt1 expression appears in the apical lobe of T. transversa bordering the <lb/>apical/mantle furrow anteriorly (Figure 4E2). The expression abuts en at the <lb/>apical/mantle furrow without overlap (Figure 5B). In the pedicle lobe, en partially <lb/>overlaps with the posterior domain of wnt1 (Figure 4E2; Figure 5B). Transcripts of <lb/>wnt1 are not present on the dorsal surface at this stage (Figure 4E2; Additional file 2: <lb/>Figure S2P). As the apical/mantle furrow deepens in the bilobed larva, wnt1 and en <lb/>transcripts resolve into well-defined non-overlapping stripes in T. transversa (Figure <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>5C). Stripes demarcate precisely the morphological furrow at the apical/mantle <lb/>boundary of T. transversa with wnt1 positioned anterior and en positioned posterior to <lb/>the furrow (Figure 5C). At the bilobed larva, wnt1 expression initiates on the dorsal <lb/>side (Figure 4E3; Additional file 2: Figure S2Q) and we observe tight coexpression of <lb/>en and wnt1 at the dorsal and ventral domains (Figure 5C). Expression of wnt1 in the <lb/>apical lobe fades in the trilobed larva (Figure 4E4) while an additional stripe of wnt1 <lb/>encircles a subdivision of the pedicle lobe (Figure 4E4). <lb/>Differently, N. anomala does not have wnt1 domains in the apical lobe and transcripts <lb/>are exclusively localized at the posterior end associated with the blastopore (Figure <lb/>4F1-F4). While en and wnt1 are coexpressed on the ventral and dorsal territories of T. <lb/>transversa, we did not detect any coexpression sites for these genes in N. anomala. <lb/>Thus, the expression of wnt1 at the apical/mantle furrow is not consistent between <lb/>brachiopods, and only T. transversa has wnt1 stripes demarcating the morphology of <lb/>the furrow. <lb/>Expression of the putative engrailed regulators pax6, pax2/5/8 and <lb/>fgf8/17/18 <lb/>The only gene consistently related to the apical/mantle furrow in both brachiopod lar-<lb/>vae is en. Early expression of en, however, does not encircle the circumference of the <lb/>embryo (Figure 4C1) suggesting that there must be factors upstream positioning the <lb/>apical/mantle boundary. Regulators of en are mostly known from the body segmenta-<lb/>tion of fruit flies and the brain development of vertebrates. In D. melanogaster, activ-<lb/>ity of even-skipped (eve or evx) position en stripes by repressing sloppy paired (slp or <lb/>foxg), which in turn limits en expression anterior to the parasegment boundary (Cadi-<lb/>gan et al. 1994; Fujioka et al. 2002). However, expression of eve and slp does not cor-<lb/>relate to the en domains at the apical/mantle boundary of T. transversa; eve is <lb/>expressed at the posterior end of the pedicle lobe, while slp is expressed at the anterior <lb/>portion of the apical lobe (Santagata et al. 2012). In the vertebrate brain, en and wnt1 <lb/>play a crucial role in the establishment of the mid/hindbrain boundary (Rhinn &amp; <lb/>Brand 2001). In the midbrain, pax2 regulates the expression of en in a positive feed-<lb/>back loop, while it represses pax6 (Okafuji et al. 1999). Expression of pax6 in the <lb/>forebrain downregulates the expression of en1 and pax2 in the midbrain, while en was <lb/>shown to directly repress the expression of pax6 (Araki &amp; Nakamura 1999; Mat-<lb/>sunaga et al. 2000; Scholpp et al. 2003). The regulation between pax6, en and <lb/>pax2/5/8 results in complementary expression patterns that define the boundary <lb/>between the diencephalon and mesencephalon (Araki &amp; Nakamura 1999; Matsunaga <lb/>et al. 2000) dependent on fgf8 signaling from the mid/hindbrain boundary (Scholpp et <lb/>al. 2003). Thus, we analyzed the expression of the brachiopod orthologs of pax6, <lb/>pax2/5/8 and fgf8/17/18 in relation to the en expression and the development of the <lb/>apical/mantle furrow. <lb/>Expression of pax6 in the larva of T. transversa localizes to the apical lobe and is <lb/>related to eye development (Passamaneck et al. 2011). During earlier stages in T. <lb/>transversa, however, we detected pax6 transcripts in a broad pair of anterior domains <lb/>(Figure 6A1). The expression of pax6 occupies the entire anterior half of the radial <lb/>gastrula and localizes to the apical lobe in subsequent stages (Figure 6A2-A4). <lb/>Expression of pax6 in N. anomala initiates as an apical ring in the radial gastrula (Fig-<lb/>ure 6B1) and localizes to the apical lobe during later stages (Figure 6B2-B4). In both <lb/>species the posterior limit of pax6 expression borders the apical/mantle furrow. <lb/></body>

			<body>T. transversa pax2/5/8 expression begins as a posterior half-ring in the radial gastrula <lb/>(Figure 6C1) and shows a narrow overlap with the pax6 territory at the future <lb/>apical/mantle furrow (Figure 7A,B). In the asymmetric gastrula pax2/5/8 transcripts <lb/>cover the whole extension of the mantle ectoderm except chaetae sac primordia and <lb/>blastoporal lips (Figure 6C2). The lateral domains of en expression are contained <lb/>within the mantle lobe domain of pax2/5/8 (Figure 7G). The anterior limit of pax2/5/8 <lb/>expression extends across the apical/mantle furrow (Figure 6C3,C4) and overlaps <lb/>with pax6 expression at the posteriormost region of the apical lobe (Figure 7C,D). <lb/>The fact that the pax2/5/8 domain transpasses the ectodermal furrow was corroborated <lb/>by the combined expression with en (Figure 7H-J). The arrangement between pax6, <lb/>pax2/5/8 and en domains is maintained in the bilobed larva (Figure 7D,J) but dissoci-<lb/>ates at the onset of mantle outgrowth. Expression of pax6 becomes restricted dorsally, <lb/>and pax2/5/8 expression localizes to the edge of the growing mantle lobe (Figure <lb/>7E,F). Similar to T. transversa, N. anomala pax2/5/8 expression occurs in a pos-<lb/>terodorsal territory in the mantle lobe (Figure 6D1) limited by the apical lobe (Figure <lb/>6D2,D3). Differently than T. transversa, we observe mesodermal expression of <lb/>pax2/5/8 in N. anomala, which correlates with coelom formation (Figure 6D4). Tran-<lb/>scripts of pax2/5/8 are localized to two pairs of domains between the chaetae sacs of <lb/>N. anomala larval mesoderm (Figure 6D4). In summary, pax6 and pax2/5/8 are <lb/>expressed in early complementary domains encircling the whole embryo with a nar-<lb/>row overlap. The posterior limit of pax6 matches the apical/mantle furrow and abuts <lb/>the lateral patches of en contained within the mantle lobe domain of pax2/5/8. <lb/>In the vertebrate brain, fgf8 expression borders the mid/hindbrain boundary with the <lb/>adjacent expression of wnt1 (Danielian &amp; McMahon 1996). We detected transcripts of <lb/>fgf8/17/18 in an anterior half-ring of T. transversa radial gastrula (Figure 6E1). In the <lb/>asymmetric gastrula, fgf8/17/18 is expressed in transverse ventral bands reaching the <lb/>blastopore lips and two pairs of circular spots positioned laterally and dorsally (Figure <lb/>6E2). A new domain at the anterior tip and an additional pair of lateral spots are acti-<lb/>vated in the bilateral gastrula (Figure 6E3). The circular spots of fgf8/17/18 positive <lb/>cells correspond to the developing chaetae sacs (Figure 7K,N) and are cleared from <lb/>en and pax2/5/8 expression (Figure 7I,K). Ventral bands of fgf8/17/18 do not border <lb/>the stripes of en posterior to the furrow (Figure 7L,M). In the bilobed larva of T. <lb/>transversa the expression in the chaetae sacs becomes interconnected, the ventral <lb/>domains in the apical lobe faded and a new domain appeared at the posterior tip (Fig-<lb/>ure 6E4). In N. anomala, fgf8/17/18 is not expressed in the radial gastrula (Figure <lb/>6F1). Expression initiates in the asymmetric gastrula with an anterior ventral band and <lb/>a more posterior domain encircling the vegetal portion near the blastopore (Figure <lb/>6F2). The anterior band extends dorsally while the posterior domain forms a band that <lb/>demarcates the anterior-most region of the mantle lobe (Figure 6F3). Similarly to T. <lb/>transversa, chaetae primordia also express fgf8/17/18 (Figure 6F3,F4). Thus, the <lb/>expression of fgf8/17/18 is mainly associated with the chaetae sacs in both species and <lb/>does not show clear correlation with ectodermal boundaries. <lb/>Over-activation of the Wnt pathway in T. transversa <lb/>Because Wnt signaling has an essential role in the axial patterning of metazoans <lb/>(Petersen &amp; Reddien 2009), we investigated if perturbing the canonical Wnt pathway <lb/>affects the development of larval boundaries in T. transversa. Over-activation of the <lb/>Wnt pathway with 1-azakenpaullone (Kunick et al. 2004) at the mid-blastula and <lb/>radial gastrula stage leads to the posteriorization of the embryonic axis (e.g. expansion <lb/>of the pedicle lobe) and a correspondent anterior shift in the expression domains of <lb/></body>

			<body>en, wnt1 and pax6 in T. transversa (Figure 8). Embryos treated at the mid-blastula <lb/>stage show no morphological or molecular traces of a mantle lobe (Figure 8B,R,S), <lb/>but form a distinct anterior portion which folds over the over-developed pedicle lobe <lb/>(Figure 8R). Interestingly, embryos treated at a later stage (radial gastrula) develop <lb/>bilateral stubs, which we interpret as incipient mantle tissue due to their mid-body <lb/>position (Figure 8J). Finally, the ectodermal furrow does not form at the expected api-<lb/>cal/mantle boundary in embryos treated at the radial gastrula (Figure 8J; Additional <lb/>file 3: Figure S3). While all treated embryos show an anterior shift in the expression <lb/>of en, wnt1 and pax6, early treatments at the mid-blastula stage entirely abolish the <lb/>anterior domains of en and wnt1 (Figure 8D,F), but do not suppress the expression of <lb/>pax6 (Figure 8H). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Segmentation is an unequivocal feature of annelids, arthropods and vertebrates, and <lb/>widespread to different degrees in other animals with bilateral symmetry, yet we have <lb/>little idea on how segmentation mechanisms have evolved and how the segmented <lb/>structures between these lineages are related. One approach to better understand the <lb/>evolution of segmentation is to expand the taxonomic sampling. Studying common <lb/>segmentation genes in other animals can help distinguish which molecular pathways <lb/>are unique to segmentation and reveal additional-and possibly ancestral-roles of <lb/>these genes. In this sense, brachiopods are well suited because their larval bodies have <lb/>putative segmented structures divided by ectodermal and mesodermal boundaries. <lb/>But, do larval brachiopods have any kind of body segmentation? <lb/>Larval brachiopods do not have body wall segmentation <lb/>The body wall of T. transversa larva is divided into three lobes by two transverse <lb/>ectodermal boundaries. If these lobes were repeated units, we would expect to find <lb/>similar morphological characters and molecular topologies at these boundaries. <lb/>Instead, the apical/mantle boundary is demarcated by an indentation furrow while the <lb/>mantle/pedicle boundary is demarcated by an ectodermal fold. These morphological <lb/>differences indicate the lobe boundaries of a trilobed brachiopod larva are not <lb/>repeated, but unique structures of the larval body. In addition, the molecular profiles <lb/>at the apical/mantle and mantle/pedicle boundaries differ, further supporting the idea <lb/>that the body wall of brachiopod larvae has no segmentation. <lb/>We found a mosaic of similarities and differences in the patterns of gene expression of <lb/>T. transversa and N. anomala. By checking the consistency of a particular domain <lb/>between the two brachiopod species, we determined which expression patterns are <lb/>likely to reflect the ground pattern of brachiopod development. Therefore, the <lb/>apical/mantle boundary is characterized by the early overlapping expression of pax6 <lb/>and pax2/5/8 in the apical and mantle lobes, respectively, with the latter containing a <lb/>pair of lateral en domains (Figure 9A). Expression of en expands lining the posterior <lb/>border of the furrow with the abutting domain of pax6 anteriorly (Figure 9A). Surpris-<lb/>ingly, the pedicle lobe domain of en in the trilobed larva of T. transversa has a recip-<lb/>rocal domain in the bilobed larva of N. anomala, even though there is no morphologi-<lb/>cal evidence of a pedicle lobe or mantle/pedicle boundary in the latter. This observa-<lb/>tion suggests that two pairs of lateral en domains is the ancestral condition for bra-<lb/>chiopods independent of the trilobed or bilobed larval morphology. <lb/></body>

			<body>Over-activation of the Wnt pathway abolishes en and wnt1 but not pax6 <lb/>expression at the apical/mantle boundary <lb/>Over-activation of the Wnt pathway caused an expansion of the pedicle lobe and of <lb/>the domains of gene expression therein, suppressed the formation of the mantle lobe <lb/>and of the apical/mantle furrow, and shifted other expression domains anteriorly. <lb/>Because embryos treated at the mid-blastula stage show no morphological or molecu-<lb/>lar traces of a mantle lobe, we suggest the boundary between the anterior and poste-<lb/>rior portions of treated larvae does not correspond to any of the wild type boundaries, <lb/>but to a unique apical/pedicle boundary defined by an ectodermal fold. However, <lb/>embryos treated at later stages (radial gastrula) show bilateral stubs of mantle tissue, <lb/>suggesting the specification of the mantle lobe of T. transversa might initiate between <lb/>mid-blastula and radial gastrula stage. The period between mid-blastula and early gas-<lb/>trulation can also play a role in the positioning of the anterior domains of en and wnt1 <lb/>-but not in the establishment of pax6 expression. Disturbance of en and wnt1 expres-<lb/>sion in the mid-blastula treatments suggests these anterior domains are not yet estab-<lb/>lished in the embryo, and their positioning is affected by the over-activation of the <lb/>Wnt pathway. Differently, the consistent expression of pax6 between mid-blastula and <lb/>radial gastrula treatments indicates the anterior domain of pax6 was not affected by <lb/>the azakenpaullone, suggesting its specification must occur before the mid-blastula <lb/>stage or be independent of the Wnt pathway. Thus, our experimental data suggests <lb/>that disturbing T. transversa Wnt signaling affects the development of the mantle lobe <lb/>and the morphology of the apical/mantle boundary, and that pax6 might have an ear-<lb/>lier upstream role in the embryonic body patterning of brachiopods. <lb/>Candidate genes are not iterated through all four partitions of N. <lb/>anomala mesoderm <lb/>While there is little evidence for body wall segmentation in larval brachiopods, the <lb/>mesoderm of N. anomala is clearly divided into four pairs of coelomic sacs. Do any <lb/>of the genes correlate with its mesoderm segmentation? Expression of en borders the <lb/>posterior boundary of coelomic sacs in the mesoderm of N. anomala. However, these <lb/>mesodermal domains are only detected in the second and third coelomic sacs. Inter-<lb/>estingly, the mesodermal domains initiate adjacent to the preceding ectodermal <lb/>domains of en suggesting the ectoderm might signal to the mesoderm during brachio-<lb/>pod development. Thus, en expression is compatible with a segmentation role only in <lb/>two out of four coeloms of the mesoderm of N. anomala. In fact, none of the other <lb/>genes expressed in the mesoderm of N. anomala (pax2/5/8, ptc, smo and gli) show <lb/>iterated patterns throughout the four coelomic sacs. In addition, en, ptc, smo and gli, <lb/>but not pax2/5/8, are also expressed in the unsegmented mesoderm of T. transversa <lb/>indicating that it is premature to assume a segmentation role for these genes in the <lb/>mesoderm of N. anomala. How does the gene expression in the mesoderm of N. <lb/>anomala compare to the segmented mesoderm of other animals? <lb/>Expression of en in annelids is restricted to mesodermal patches and does not resem-<lb/>ble the patterns in brachiopods (Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003; Seaver &amp; Kaneshige 2006). <lb/>Even though, in both brachiopods and annelids, en expression in the mesoderm seems <lb/>to be connected to the en expression in the ectoderm (Seaver &amp; Kaneshige 2006). <lb/>Expression of en in N. anomala mesoderm, despite not being repeated, is similar to <lb/>the more distantly related amphioxus (Holland et al. 1997) and onychophorans (Eriks-<lb/>son et al. 2009; Wedeen et al. 1997) with en expression localized to the posterior por-<lb/>tion of mesodermal somites. However, the actual role of a posterior en domain in the <lb/></body>

			<body>mesoderm is unknown and requires further investigation in these animals. In contrast, <lb/>the role of en in the body wall segmentation has been thoroughly studied. <lb/>Gene expression does not support a typical segment polarity role in <lb/>brachiopods <lb/>Segment polarity genes are the hallmark of arthropod segmentation. We investigated <lb/>whether the expression of en, wnt1 and hh orthologs in brachiopods is compatible <lb/>with a putative segment polarity role. The parasegment of arthropods is characterized <lb/>by a cell population expressing en and hh adjacent to an anterior cell population <lb/>expressing wnt1, ptc, smo and gli (Figure 9C). This stands in contrast to brachiopods <lb/>where transcripts of hh are not detected in en-expressing cells, and ptc, smo, and gli <lb/>are not coexpressed with wnt1 at any developmental stage (Figure 9C). Thus, these <lb/>differences in the gene expression do not support the presence of a typical segment <lb/>polarity role in larval brachiopods. <lb/>On the other hand, we made the striking observation that en and wnt1 are expressed as <lb/>adjacent stripes demarcating the apical/mantle furrow of the brachiopod T. transversa. <lb/>Such spatial arrangement is not only a characteristic feature of D. melanogaster <lb/>parasegments, but a well conserved pattern in the segmentation of other arthropods <lb/>(Damen 2007; Hughes &amp; Kaufman 2002; Mellenthin et al. 2006; Nagy 1994). <lb/>Remarkably, the adjacent expression of en and wnt1 also demarcates the segment <lb/>boundaries of one annelid, P. dumerilii (Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003). It was suggested <lb/>that this similarity reflects an evolutionary conservation of segmentation supporting <lb/>the homology between annelid segments and arthropod parasegments (Prud&apos;homme <lb/>et al. 2003). However, distinguishing homology from convergence requires the recov-<lb/>ery of the ancestral character state for each group, which in turn requires the compara-<lb/>tive analysis of ingroup variability. While en and wnt1 have a conserved role in <lb/>arthropod segmentation, the expression of segment polarity genes in annelids is more <lb/>variable and does not support a role in segment formation (Seaver 2003). <lb/>First, the spatial relationship of en expression and segment boundaries differs between <lb/>species. It occurs at the posterior portion of segments in the leech Helobdella triseri-<lb/>alis (Lans et al. 1993; Wedeen &amp; Weisblat 1991) and Capitella teleta (Seaver &amp; <lb/>Kaneshige 2006), at the anterior portion in P. dumerilii (Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003) and <lb/>Chaetopterus sp. (Seaver et al. 2001), and not associated with segments in Hydroides <lb/>elegans (Seaver &amp; Kaneshige 2006) and Pristina leidyi (Bely &amp; Wray 2001). Second, <lb/>en expression can be restricted to individual cells (Bely &amp; Wray 2001; Lans et al. <lb/>1993; Wedeen &amp; Weisblat 1991), discontinuous patches (Seaver &amp; Kaneshige 2006) <lb/>or fuller stripes lining the segment boundary (Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003); only the latter <lb/>supporting a role in segment formation. Third, the temporal relationship of en expres-<lb/>sion and the morphological segmentation varies, and only in P. dumerilii and C. teleta <lb/>is en expressed in stripes before the morphology is visible (Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003; <lb/>Seaver &amp; Kaneshige 2006). In fact, with the exception of P. dumerilii (Dray et al. <lb/>2010; Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003), the expression of en is not compatible with a segmen-<lb/>tation role in most annelids investigated so far, i.e., the leech H. triserialis (Lans et al. <lb/>1993; Seaver &amp; Shankland 2001; Wedeen &amp; Weisblat 1991), P. leidyi (Bely &amp; Wray <lb/>2001), Chaetopterus sp. (Seaver et al. 2001), C. teleta and H. elegans (Seaver &amp; <lb/>Kaneshige 2006). <lb/>Expression of other segment polarity genes in annelids is much less known but still <lb/>inconsistent between species. In P. dumerilii, expression of both wnt1 and hh supports <lb/>a role in segment formation (Dray et al. 2010; Prud&apos;homme et al. 2003). In contrast, <lb/></body>

			<body>data from the only other annelid where wnt1 has been investigated does not support a <lb/>role in segmentation (Seaver &amp; Kaneshige 2006). Expression of hh is also not com-<lb/>patible with a segmentation role in Helobdella robusta (Kang et al. 2003) or C. teleta <lb/>(Seaver &amp; Kaneshige 2006). Therefore, expression of segment polarity genes is vari-<lb/>able even within the homologous segments of annelids. For this reason, the ancestral <lb/>character state regarding the expression of en, wnt1 and hh in annelids and their rela-<lb/>tion to segmentation remains unresolved. <lb/>In summary, the expression of segment polarity genes is greatly conserved in arthro-<lb/>pods, but variable in annelids and brachiopods (inconsistent wnt1 expression between <lb/>T. transversa and N. anomala). This variation weakens the idea that segment polarity <lb/>genes had an ancestral segmentation role in annelids and renders uncertain if wnt1 <lb/>was expressed at the apical/mantle boundary of a brachiopod ancestor. It suggests the <lb/>adjacent expression of en and wnt1 might be a convergent pattern between one <lb/>annelid (P. dumerilii) and one brachiopod (T. transversa). However, additional data in <lb/>annelids are needed to recover the ancestral state for the expression of wnt1 and hh <lb/>and maybe expose the developmental basis for the recurrent evolution of segment <lb/>polarity like patterns. In any case, we show that abutting stripes of en and wnt1 are not <lb/>exclusive for the body segmentation of annelids and arthropods-it also occurs in a <lb/>nonsegmental boundary of a larval brachiopod. The similarities can reflect the homol-<lb/>ogy of developmental mechanisms of boundary formation, not linked to segmentation, <lb/>or simply the cooption of an ancestral molecular network to various developmental <lb/>boundaries. <lb/>Ancestral expression of engrailed was nonsegmental <lb/>As discussed above, wnt1 expression is variable in the studied brachiopod species. If <lb/>we strictly consider the genes with consistent expression (i.e., pax6, pax2/5/8 and en), <lb/>the apical/mantle boundary of brachiopods is more similar to a vertebrate brain <lb/>boundary than to an annelid segment boundary. In the vertebrate brain an anterior <lb/>domain of pax6 initially overlaps with the more posterior expression of pax2/5/8 and <lb/>en and defines the position of the di/mesencephalon boundary by mutual repression <lb/>(Araki &amp; Nakamura 1999; Matsunaga et al. 2000). The spatial correlation of these <lb/>genes regarding the apical/mantle furrow of brachiopods is similar to the patterns <lb/>defining the di/mesencephalon boundary (Figure 9B). Since there is no morphological <lb/>evidence that a vertebrate brain is homologous to brachiopod larval lobes, this simi-<lb/>larity in gene expression is likely the result of convergent evolution. In protostomes, <lb/>even though pax6 is recurrently associated to anterior structures, the expression of <lb/>pax2/5/8 is variable and not complementary to pax6 (Additional file 4: Table S1). <lb/>However, data on the expression of pax6 and pax2/5/8 are still scarce outside arthro-<lb/>pods and it is unclear if the brachiopod pattern is ancestral to protostomes. In contrast, <lb/>the complementary patterns of pax6 and pax2/5/8 expression occur in the ectoderm of <lb/>hemichordates (Pani et al. 2012) and cephalochordates (Glardon et al. 1998; Kozmik <lb/>et al. 1999) suggesting this is a conserved feature of deuterostomes. In fact, deuteros-<lb/>tomes share a similar arrangement of gene products along the anteroposterior axis, a <lb/>feature likely conserved in their last common ancestor (Lowe et al. 2015). Thus, if <lb/>bilaterians had a conserved molecular cassette related to the patterning of the antero-<lb/>posterior axis, such genes could have become associated to the various morphological <lb/>structures evolved within each lineage and been independently recruited to similar <lb/>developmental roles. <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>We consider the idea above by reviewing the expression of en, a gene more widely <lb/>studied across bilaterians. The comparison reveals the majority of groups have bilat-<lb/>eral or dorsal domains of en in the ectoderm as its earliest instance of embryonic <lb/>expression (Figure 10). Interestingly, many domains correlate to some kind of epithe-<lb/>lial boundary such as the apical/mantle boundary of larval brachiopods, head/trunk <lb/>and segment boundaries of annelids, shell borders in molluscs, arthropod head/trunk <lb/>and segment boundaries, seam cells in nematodes, collar/trunk boundary in hemichor-<lb/>dates, brain boundaries in vertebrates and somite boundaries in cephalochordates <lb/>(Additional file 4: Table S1). Such data indicates that the last common bilaterian <lb/>ancestor had en expressed during early embryogenesis and that these homologous <lb/>domains became associated to a variety of developmental boundaries. Can we identify <lb/>the ancestral character state for the expression of en in bilaterians? <lb/>Annelids and brachiopods share a pair of lateral en domains that localize to the <lb/>head/trunk and apical/mantle boundary, respectively. In D. melanogaster the first <lb/>stripe of en occurs at the cephalic furrow (Fjose et al. 1985) and in hemichordates en <lb/>is expressed at the collar/trunk boundary (Pani et al. 2012). Thus, comparative data <lb/>suggests that en might have been associated to the interface between an anterior (e.g., <lb/>head) and a posterior region of the embryo (e.g., trunk), a division shared by most <lb/>bilaterians. From this ancestral embryonic domain(s), en was coopted independently <lb/>to trunk segmentation in the arthropod parasegments, annelid segments, brachiopod <lb/>larval boundaries and other developmental boundaries. This phenomenon can explain <lb/>the mosaic of similarities and differences between gene expression and morphological <lb/>characters in the Bilateria. Nevertheless, testing this idea requires the resolution of the <lb/>basal bilaterian relationships to clarify the ancestral morphological characters as well <lb/>as comparative gene expression studies in a number of other protostomes like gas-<lb/>trotrichs, rotifers, chaetognaths, nemerteans and priapulids. Only then will we have <lb/>better support to establish the ancestral character states for each lineage and under-<lb/>stand the interplay between molecular pathways and morphological characters during <lb/>animal evolution. It is important to note that the homology of en domains during the <lb/>early embryogenesis of bilaterians suggested by comparative data, does not imply the <lb/>conservation of en function in boundary development. Thus, ancestral homologous <lb/>domains might have functionally diverged within the different morphological contexts <lb/>of Bilateria. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>In conclusion, we show that a fine-grained comparative approach is crucial to distin-<lb/>guish ancestral and derived traits. Brachiopods have a conserved expression of pax6, <lb/>pax2/5/8 and en, which correlates to the morphology at the apical/mantle boundary. <lb/>We found that a nonsegmental ectodermal boundary can express en and wnt1 simi-<lb/>larly to arthropod parasegments and that this might be a convergent pattern. In addi-<lb/>tion, a comparative analysis suggests the ancestral bilaterian had a pair of en domains <lb/>that were coopted to different developmental boundaries during evolution. Therefore, <lb/>arthropods and annelids might have independently recruited pre-existing boundary <lb/>formation mechanisms for body segmentation (Martindale &amp; Hejnol 2009). This argu-<lb/>mentation is supported by recent phylogenies with improved resolution in the Proto-<lb/>stomia, which challenge the homology between annelid and arthropod segments, and <lb/>suggest an spiralian ancestor without trunk segmentation (Laumer et al. 2015; Struck <lb/>et al. 2014). Overall, gene expression data in a comparative phylogenetic context is a <lb/>promising approach to deconstruct segmentation into more fundamental developmen-<lb/></body>

			<body>do not have a well defined apical/mantle furrow and show bilateral stubs correspon-<lb/>dent to incipient mantle lobe tissue. Treated embryos show no sign of chaetae forma-<lb/>tion. (C-L) Expression of en in control and treated embryos. Control embryos have an <lb/>apical/mantle stripe, a ventral and a dorsal domain of en. Early (mid-blastula) and late <lb/>(radial gastrula) treatments show a posterior laterodorsal en domain, but only in the <lb/>latter we detected an anterior en domain consisting of scattered ectodermal cells and a <lb/>broad mesodermal domain in the anterior end (arrowhead). (E-N) Expression of wnt1 <lb/>in control and treated embryos. Control embryos have wnt1 expressed around the pos-<lb/>terior lip of the blastopore. In the treated samples there is an expansion of this poste-<lb/>rior domain, occupying half of the blastopore length. Only embryos treated at the <lb/>radial gastrula stage show an anterior expression domain of wnt1 at the apical plate <lb/>(arrowhead), separated from the posterior domain by a subterminal band clear of <lb/>expression. (G-P) Expression of pax6 in control and treated embryos. Control <lb/>embryos have pax6 transcripts contained in the apical lobe. In all treated embryos the <lb/>expression of pax6 shifts anteriorly localizing to the apical plate (arrowheads). (Q-S) <lb/>Control and treated samples from mid-blastula to larva. (Q) Morphology of control <lb/>larvae incubated with DMSO is consistent with a wild type trilobed larva of T. <lb/>transversa. The apical lobe has a row of corpuscular bodies at its posterior portion <lb/>just above the apical/mantle furrow. The mantle lobe has outgrown with the extensive <lb/>underlying mesoderm and musculature, and the pedicle lobe shows dorsal putative <lb/>gland cells (gc). (R-S) Morphology of treated embryos developed into larvae reveals <lb/>an expansion of posterior structures. Larval body has a distinct anterior portion cov-<lb/>ered by corpuscular bodies and an unclosed blastoporal opening at its center (R). <lb/>Higher concentrations of 1-azakenpaullone (10 ¬µM) resulted in a diminished anterior <lb/>portion (S). Morphology of the posterior portion resembles an over-developed pedicle <lb/>lobe with putative gland cells on the dorsal side. The anterior and posterior regions of <lb/>treated embryos are demarcated by an ectodermal fold. We neither detected signs of <lb/>chaetae sacs nor evidence for the presence of a mantle lobe. (T-X) Expression of en <lb/>in wild type, control and treated embryos. Wild type expression of en consists of a <lb/>ventral and a dorsal domain in the pedicle lobe (T, arrowheads; same specimen as Fig-<lb/>ure 4C4). Control embryos have a similar pattern, although regions of unspecific <lb/>staining in the pedicle lobe (*) obfuscate the signal (U, arrowhead). Treated embryos <lb/>show a broader expression domain of en encircling the embryo at the anterior portion <lb/>of the pedicle lobe, similar to wild type and controls (W, X). At 10 ¬µM, en is also <lb/>expressed in the mesoderm at the anterior end (X, arrowhead). (Y-B&apos;) Expression of <lb/>wnt1 in wild type, control and treated embryos. Wild type expression of wnt1 colocal-<lb/>izes with en expression (T), except for an additional posterior domain at the pedicle <lb/>lobe (Y, same specimen as Figure 4E4). Control embryos also display shell back-<lb/>ground (*), but signal at the dorsal side is visible (Z, arrowhead). Transcripts of wnt1 <lb/>in treated embryos occupy the same territories as en (W, X), except for the absence of <lb/>wnt1 in the anterior mesoderm (B&apos;). (C&apos;-F&apos;) Expression of pax6 in wild type, control <lb/>and treated embryos. Wild type expression of pax6 occurs in the dorsal portion of the <lb/>apical lobe (arrowhead).
