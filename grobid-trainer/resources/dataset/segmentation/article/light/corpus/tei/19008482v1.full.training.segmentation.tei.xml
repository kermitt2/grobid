			<front>Abstract: <lb/>Introduction: <lb/>Cases of injection drug use-related infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) requiring surgery are <lb/>rising in the setting of the current U.S. opioid epidemic. We thus aimed to determine the nature <lb/>of addiction interventions in the perioperative period. <lb/>Methods: <lb/>This is a retrospective review of surgical IDU-IE from 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary care <lb/>center in New Haven, Connecticut. The data collected included substances consumed <lb/>recreationally, consultations by social work (SW), psychiatry, pharmacotherapy for addiction, <lb/>and evidence of enrollment in a drug rehabilitation program upon discharge. <lb/>Among patients with active drug use (ADU), we compared the 24-month survival of <lb/>those who received at least one form of addiction intervention to that of those who did not. <lb/>Results: <lb/>Forty-two patients (75%) had active drug use. Among them, 22 used heroin. Forty-one <lb/>patients (73.2%) saw SW, 17 (30.4%) saw psychiatry; 14 (25%) saw neither SW nor psychiatry. <lb/>Twenty-one patients (37.5%) received methadone, 6 (10.7%) received buprenorphine, 1 <lb/>(0.02%) received naltrexone; 26 (46.4%) did not receive any pharmacotherapy. Fifteen patients <lb/>(26.8%) attended a drug rehabilitation program, 13 (86.7%) of whom had seen SW and 8 (53%) <lb/>psychiatry. Among patients with ADU, there was no statistically significant difference in <lb/>survival between those who received at least one intervention and those who did not (p=0.1 by <lb/>log rank). <lb/>Conclusion: <lb/></front>

			<front>Addiction interventions are deployed inconsistently for patients with surgical IDU-IE. <lb/>Untreated substance use disorder and recurrent endocarditis are the leading cause of death in this <lb/>population. Studying best-practices for perioperative interventions in IDU-IE and establishing <lb/>protocols are of the upmost importance. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction: <lb/>Heroin use has sharply increased in the United States. 1 With the current opioid epidemic, <lb/>data shows that individuals with prescription opioid use are 40 times more likely to inject <lb/>heroin. 2,3 Concurrently, the proportion of injection drug use-related infective endocarditis (IDU-<lb/>IE) cases requiring valve surgery has increased significantly. 4,5,6 . Although surgical interventions <lb/>play a major role in addressing IE refractory to pharmacotherapy, 7 studies suggest that patients <lb/>who use injection drugs (PUID) and undergo surgery for IDU-IE die mostly of causes related to <lb/>untreated substance use disorder (recurrent endocarditis or drug overdose). 8,9 In this study, we <lb/>sought to describe the patterns of addiction treatment in PUID with IDU-IE requiring surgery. <lb/>Methods: <lb/>Patient Population: <lb/>We conducted a retrospective review of 56 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac <lb/>surgery for IDU-IE from 2011 to 2016 at Yale New Haven Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in <lb/>the United States. The patients were defined as having IE based on presentation with valvular <lb/>disease of infectious etiology, as defined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention <lb/>(CDC), and adopted by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Duke Criteria for infective <lb/>endocarditis. 10 Intravenous drug use was defined as a patient having a history of illicit drug use. <lb/></body>

			<body>Further chart review was performed to characterize the drug use as either ongoing or remote, as <lb/>well as determining the types of drugs, based on patient reporting and collateral information <lb/>from family members available in the medical record. The study was approved by the Yale <lb/>Institutional Review Board and individual patient consent was waived. <lb/>Data Sources: <lb/>Data were collected through the local database extracted from the EMR and additional <lb/>review of individual patients&apos; electronic medical record. Addiction treatment was defined as the <lb/>aggregate of psychiatry and social work consults during inpatient stay and inpatient medication <lb/>(buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone, naloxone). Rehabilitation attendance upon discharge <lb/>was confirmed via electronic health record review, specifically by searching discharge <lb/>summaries, nursing notes and follow-up visit notes for mentions of rehabilitation attendance. <lb/>Survival: <lb/>24-month survival data was through linkage with the Connecticut state vital statistics <lb/>data. Kaplan Meier curve characterized mid-term survival. A p value &lt;0.05 was used to define <lb/>statistically significant difference. <lb/>Results: <lb/>Patient Characteristics: <lb/>This study included 56 PUID who underwent surgical intervention for IDU-IE. The <lb/>majority of patients were male (49, 87.5%) with average age of 44 Â± 13 years. Prevalence of <lb/>liver disease (23, 41.1%) was high, 22 patients (39.3%) had a history of prior stroke, and 15 <lb/>(26.8%) had prior cardiac surgery, the majority of which had prior valve surgery (13/15, 86.7%). <lb/></body>

			<body>Seventeen patients (30.4%) received double-valve surgery, and 3 (5.4%) received triple-valve <lb/>surgery (table 1). <lb/>History of Drug Use: <lb/>In this population, 42 patients had active drug use at the time of their surgery, while the <lb/>rest were noted to have a remote history of drug use. Among the 42, more than half of patients <lb/>used heroin (22, 52.4%). Among the 22 patients who used heroin, over a third used heroin and <lb/>cocaine only (8, 36.4%), and nearly a quarter (5, 22.7%) used heroin along with 2 or more other <lb/>drugs (benzodiazepine, PCP, street suboxone, cocaine, Percocet, marijuana). Additionally, more <lb/>than half of patients in the entire group of 56 had a concurrent history of tobacco use (29, <lb/>51.8%). <lb/>Addiction Treatment Pattern: <lb/>Specialty Consults: <lb/>Among the 56 patients, 40 (71.4%) patients were seen by a social worker, and 17 (30.4%) <lb/>were seen by a psychiatrist during their hospitalization. Fourteen patients were not seen by either <lb/>a social worker or a psychiatrist; therefore, 25% of patients had no psychosocial consultation <lb/>before being discharged (table 2). <lb/>Among the 42 patients who had active drug use, 33 (79%) were seen by a social worker, <lb/>15 (36%) were seen by a psychiatrist, and 8 were not seen by either a social worker or a <lb/>psychiatrist; therefore, 19% of patients with active drug use had no psychosocial consultation <lb/>before being discharged (table 2). <lb/></body>

			<body>Pharmacotherapy: <lb/>Pharmacotherapy was defined as the administration of methadone, buprenorphine, <lb/>naltrexone or naloxone during the patient&apos;s hospitalization. 21 patients (37.5%) were prescribed <lb/>methadone, 6 patients (10.7%) were prescribed buprenorphine, 14 (25%) were prescribed <lb/>naloxone, and 1 (0.02%) was prescribed naltrexone. 26 patients (46.4%) were not prescribed any <lb/>of the aforementioned medications. <lb/>Among the 42 patients with active drug use, 14 (33%) patients received methadone, 5 <lb/>(11.9%) received buprenorphine (including 2 who received both buprenorphine and methadone) <lb/>and 1 (2.4%) received naltrexone. 18 (42.9%) patients total received at least 1 form of <lb/>pharmacotherapy. <lb/>A total of 6 (14.3%) patients out of the 42 patients with active drug use received both <lb/>pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions (table 2). <lb/>Drug Rehabilitation Program Attendance <lb/>Fifteen patients were discharged to a drug rehabilitation facility. Thirteen (86.7%) <lb/>patients discharged to a rehabilitation facility were seen by a social worker, and 8/15 (53.3%) <lb/>patients discharged to a rehabilitation facility had been seen by a psychiatrist. <lb/>Among patients with active drug use, 10 patients were discharged to a drug rehabilitation <lb/>facility. 9 (90%) were seen by a social worker and 7 (70%) were seen by a psychiatrist. <lb/>Conversely, among patients who did not go to a rehabilitation facility, 27 (65.9%) were <lb/>seen by a social worker, and 9 (22%) were seen by a psychiatrist. The rehabilitation programs <lb/>included 12-step group rehabilitation, narcotics anonymous, and adherence to daily methadone <lb/>programs (table 2). <lb/></body>

			<body>Survival: <lb/>Unadjusted mid-term survival showed no statistically significant (p=0.1 by log rank) difference <lb/>between patients who received no treatment and those who received at least 1 form of <lb/>intervention, including pharmacotherapy, psychiatry and social work consultations (Figure 1). <lb/>Discussion: <lb/>The aim of this study was to characterize patterns of addiction treatment at a tertiary <lb/>center for PUID with IDU-IE requiring surgical intervention and their participation in drug <lb/>rehabilitation programs upon discharge. We observed that there was a heterogeneous pattern of <lb/>care provided given the lack of standardized protocols for addiction care. Currently, there are no <lb/>guidelines for pharmacotherapy or usage of specialty consultations for addiction and <lb/>psychosocial concerns surrounding the surgical management of IDU-IE. <lb/>We observed that psychiatrists were consulted as a post-operative care pathway. <lb/>Methadone was most frequently prescribed as pharmacotherapy for addiction treatment <lb/>postoperatively; however, harm reduction interventions through naloxone prescription were not <lb/>deployed for all patients. As previously elaborated in a case-series for IDU-IE among PUID, <lb/>their hospitalization is an important but often missed window of opportunity for medication-<lb/>assisted therapy initiation. 11 These findings are in line with prior studies suggesting that PUID <lb/>hospitalized for IDU-IE receive suboptimal addiction treatment. 12 <lb/>An important finding in our study is the underutilization of transition to drug <lb/>rehabilitation facilities. Notably, among 42 patients who had been actively using drugs, only 10 <lb/>patients were discharged to a rehabilitation program. Most patients who were discharged to a <lb/>rehabilitation program/facility were seen by a social worker and by a psychiatrist during their <lb/></body>

			<body>hospitalization, suggesting the importance of the role played by social workers and psychiatrists <lb/>in the care of these patients. <lb/>As rates of IDU-IE requiring surgical intervention have been increasing throughout the <lb/>opioid epidemic nationally, 5,13 cardiac surgeons have been deliberating on the best way to care <lb/>for these patients. Due to the risk of recurrence/reinfection associated with drug use 14 and the <lb/>limited nature of resources, different strategies have been proposed. A recent study highlighting <lb/>right-sided endocarditis cases requiring surgery recommends staging operations, starting with a <lb/>total tricuspid valvectomy, and a subsequent prosthetic valve implantation provided that patients <lb/>are able to demonstrate abstinence from using drugs during a latency period of 6 months in <lb/>between the two surgeries. 5 This period of abstinence, however, is a state of vulnerability for <lb/>patients, putting them at high risk of overdose should they relapse. 15 <lb/>Given that surgery for prosthetic valve endocarditis has been shown to have comparable <lb/>outcomes to surgery for native valve endocarditis, 16 some surgeons are inclined to opt for a <lb/>comprehensive approach with immediate valve replacement. 17 Bioethicists, however, raise the <lb/>concern of resource limitation. 18 In that vein, some suggest that contracts between patients and <lb/>surgeons, akin to contracts between pain specialists and patients, may contribute to curbing <lb/>return to drug use, and thus reinfection rates. 19 <lb/>However, this is a controversial position, and many oppose the notion of contracts <lb/>dictating future access to life saving measures such as cardiac surgery, especially for such a <lb/>marginalized population, given that addiction is the root problem. 20 As our study demonstrates, <lb/>peri-operative addiction management is not consistently employed in a large proportion of PUID. <lb/>Several studies have shown presumed continued drug use to be the leading cause of death among <lb/>PUID who underwent cardiac surgery for IDU-IE. 8 <lb/></body>

			<body>Continued drug use is a consequence of addiction, and inherently increases the risk of <lb/>reinfection. Addiction is a chronic neurobiological disorder, characterized in part by craving and <lb/>withdrawal symptoms. Studies show that initiation of pharmacotherapy for treatment of opioid <lb/>dependence in emergency room settings yields reduced self-reported illicit opioid use and <lb/>decreased use of inpatient addiction treatment services. 21-23 Additionally, studies suggest that for <lb/>comprehensive addiction care for patients with opioid use disorder during hospitalization <lb/>improves not only patient outcomes, but also provider outcomes. 24 Other interventions such as <lb/>long term residential addiction treatment and patient navigator programs have been shown to <lb/>improve outcomes and reduce readmission rates for at risk patients, hence the importance of <lb/>post-operative discharge to drug rehabilitation facilities or enrollment in rehabilitation <lb/>programs. 25 In cases where such resources may not be deployed, adequate outpatient follow-up <lb/>after initiation of pharmacotherapy could contribute to sustaining improvement in outcomes. <lb/>Limitations: <lb/>This retrospective study was conducted at a single-center by observational electronic <lb/>medical record chart review. Data on reoperation and recurrent endocarditis was not completely <lb/>captured. For patients with a history of remote drug use but no indication of active use, the type <lb/>of drugs consumed was not ascertained. Given that this is an observational study with a relatively <lb/>small sample, the direct impact of medication initiation for addiction treatment and psychosocial <lb/>consultations on rehabilitation attendance after discharge were not determined with statistical <lb/>significance. <lb/>Conclusion: <lb/></body>

			<body>Perioperative intervention for opioid use disorder in patients undergoing cardiac surgery <lb/>for IDU-IE does not happen in a standardized fashion. Some patients receive pharmacotherapy <lb/>and are seen by specialists equipped to address psychosocial factors, but not all. Given that <lb/>mortality in this patient population is predominantly due to untreated substance use disorder, the <lb/>concomitance of addiction treatment and surgical intervention through multidisciplinary care is <lb/>of extreme importance. In the context of an opioid epidemic in the U.S., our findings argue for <lb/>the development of a standard peri-operative addiction care pathway for this patient population. <lb/></body>
