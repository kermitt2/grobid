This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com <lb/>Abstract Twenty-two new N-phenyl-2-(4-phenylpiper-<lb/>azin-1-yl)acetamide derivatives have been synthesized and <lb/>evaluated for their anticonvulsant activity in animal models <lb/>of epilepsy. These molecules have been designed as analogs <lb/>of previously obtained anticonvulsant active pyrrolidine-<lb/>2,5-diones in which heterocyclic imide ring has been chan-<lb/>ged into chain amide bound. The final compounds were <lb/>synthesized in the alkylation reaction of the corresponding <lb/>amines with the previously obtained alkylating reagents <lb/>2-chloro-1-(3-chlorophenyl)ethanone (1) or 2-chloro-1-[3-<lb/>(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]ethanone (2). Initial anticonvulsant <lb/>screening was performed using standard maximal elec-<lb/>troshock (MES) and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole <lb/>screens in mice and/or rats. Several compounds were tested <lb/>additionally in the psychomotor seizures (6-Hz model). The <lb/>acute neurological toxicity was determined applying the <lb/>rotarod test. The results of pharmacological studies showed <lb/>activity exclusively in the MES seizures especially for <lb/>3-(trifluoromethyl)anilide derivatives, whereas majority of <lb/>3-chloroanilide analogs were inactive. It should be empha-<lb/>size that several molecules showed also activity in the 6-Hz <lb/>screen which is an animal model of human partial and ther-<lb/>apy-resistant epilepsy. In the in vitro studies, the most potent <lb/>derivative 20 was observed as moderate binder to the neu-<lb/>ronal voltage-sensitive sodium channels (site 2). The SAR <lb/>studies for anticonvulsant activity confirmed the crucial role <lb/>of pyrrolidine-2,5-dione core fragment for anticonvulsant <lb/>activity. <lb/>Keywords Phenylacetamides Á Anticonvulsant activity Á <lb/>SAR studies Á In vivo studies Á In vitro studies Á <lb/>Epilepsy <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disor-<lb/>ders, affecting approximately 0.5-1 % people worldwide. <lb/>It has a chronic and progressive nature, characterized by <lb/>recurring seizures of various manifestations. The basic <lb/>method of the treatment of epilepsy is pharmacotherapy. It <lb/>is a symptomatic treatment which allows abolishing or <lb/>reducing the number of seizure episodes, however, does not <lb/>inhibit the pathophysiological processes of epileptogenesis <lb/>and does not eliminate organic changes in the central <lb/>nervous system (CNS), which are the underlying causes of <lb/>the disease. In about 25 % of patients, the desired results <lb/>cannot be achieved with the use of pharmacotherapy, this <lb/>form of disease is known as refractory epilepsy, the treat-<lb/>ment of which is based on surgical vagus nerve stimulation <lb/>(WHO, 2010; Bell and Sander, 2002; Chang and Lowen-<lb/>stein, 2003). The variety of molecular targets, not always <lb/>precisely definite, makes it difficult to establish an <lb/>unequivocal mechanism of action of anti-epileptic drugs <lb/>(AEDs). This fact is also reflected in the limited possi-<lb/>bilities of designing new drugs on the base of the structure <lb/>of a given biological target. Therefore, currently, there are <lb/>two different methods of search for new anticonvulsants: <lb/>modifications of clinically effective AEDs or synthesis of <lb/>entirely new structures (Khan et al., 2012). Taking into <lb/>consideration the above limitations, many authors con-<lb/>ducted attempts to identify the structural features crucial <lb/>for anticonvulsant activity. On the basis of these <lb/></body>

			<body>researches, several pharmacophoric models, enabling a <lb/>more rational design of new anticonvulsants, have been <lb/>described. Thus, one of the important core fragments of <lb/>anticonvulsants is defined by nitrogen heterocyclic system, <lb/>usually imide or lactam and phenyl or alkyl groups at-<lb/>tached to the heterocyclic system (Wong et al., 1986; <lb/>Bruno-Blanch et al., 2003; Malawska, 2005). This common <lb/>template is present in the structures of old, however well-<lb/>established AEDs, such as ethosuximide and phenytoin as <lb/>well as among the newest drugs, e.g., levetiracetam, bri-<lb/>varacetam or seletracetam (Rogawski and Porter, 1990; <lb/>Bialer et al., 2007) (Fig. 1). <lb/>Bearing in mind the aforementioned, in our laboratory, <lb/>since many years we have been conducting studies in the <lb/>group of pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives differently sub-<lb/>stituted at the imide nitrogen atom as well as at the 3-po-<lb/>sition of the heterocyclic ring as candidates on new AEDs. <lb/>Many of these compounds were highly effective in the <lb/>animal models of epilepsy (Kamin ´ski et al., 2014, 2013, <lb/>2011a, b; Obniska et al., 2013, 2010; Obniska and <lb/>Zago ´rska, 2003). Structures and designated median effec-<lb/>tive doses (ED 50 ) in the maximal electroshock (MES) sei-<lb/>zure test for the model pyrrolidine-2,5-diones obtained in <lb/>former research (Obniska et al., 2013) are shown in Fig. 2. <lb/>Another important structural fragment of many anti-<lb/>convulsants as well as compounds being currently in <lb/>clinical trials is an amide moiety presented in a chain form <lb/>(Bruno-Blanch et al., 2003; Hadjipavlou-Litina, 1998; <lb/>Luszczki, 2009; Hen et al., 2010; Morieux et al., 2008; <lb/>Ghidini et al., 2006; Beguin et al., 2003; Masereel et al., <lb/>2002). It should be stressed that this chemical structure <lb/>possessed several the newest AEDs such as lacosamide <lb/>(chemically the functionalized amino acid) or valrocemide <lb/>and valnoctamide which are the unteratogenic derivatives <lb/>of valproic acid (Fig. 3). <lb/>Taking into consideration the above findings in the <lb/>current studies, we have focused on synthesis of new <lb/>N-phenylacetamide derivatives as targets for new AEDs. <lb/>These compounds were designed as analogs of corre-<lb/>sponding pyrrolidine-2,5-dine derivatives, which showed <lb/>high anticonvulsant activity in the animal models of <lb/>epilepsy (Obniska et al., 2010). The main modification <lb/>relied on the change of imide ring into chain amide bound <lb/>(Fig. 4). Therefore, the aim of the current studies was to <lb/>elucidate how the structure of imide/amide fragment <lb/>affects anticonvulsant activity. <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>Chemistry <lb/>The synthesis of compounds 3-24 was accomplished as <lb/>shown in Scheme 1. The starting materials 2-chloro-1-(3-<lb/>chlorophenyl)ethanone <lb/>(1) <lb/>and <lb/>2-chloro-1-[3-(tri-<lb/>fluoromethyl)phenyl]ethanone (2) were prepared by acy-<lb/>lation of 3-chloroaniline or 3-trifluoromethylaniline with <lb/>2-chloroacetyl chloride. The reaction was carried out at <lb/>0 °C for 3 h in the mixture consisted of dichloromethane <lb/>(DCM) and 2 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The <lb/>final compounds 3-24 were synthesized in the alkylation <lb/>reaction of the corresponding amines with the previously <lb/>obtained alkylating reagents 1 and 2. The reaction was <lb/>carried out at a temperature of 60 °C in a biphasic liquid-<lb/>solid system consisting of dry acetone, potassium carbon-<lb/>ate and catalytic amount of potassium iodide. The progress <lb/>of the reaction was monitored using HPLC chromatogra-<lb/>phy. Compounds 3-24 were obtained in yields ranging <lb/>from 44 to 78 %. Their purities were assessed by HPLC <lb/>chromatography (the HPLC chromatogram of 22 is shown <lb/>in Fig. 5). The final compounds were fully characterized by <lb/>elemental analyses (C, H, N) and 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, 19 F <lb/>NMR, LC/MS spectra. The detailed physicochemical and <lb/>analytical data are listed in the experimental section. <lb/>The 1 H NMR spectrum of compound 3 displayed several <lb/>proton chemical shifts consistent with the proposed struc-<lb/>ture. The eight protons of piperazine moiety were observed <lb/>as broad multiplet (d 3.06-3.93 ppm). The methylene <lb/>linker at the acetamide fragment occurred as singlet at d <lb/>4.33 ppm. The aromatic protons were observed at the ex-<lb/>pected chemical shifts as six multiplets within the range of <lb/>d 6.81-7.86 ppm. The amide (NH) proton appeared as <lb/>Fig. 1 Structures of known AEDs containing nitrogen heterocyclic ring <lb/></body>

The 13 C NMR spectrum of 3 showed four <lb/>peaks at d 51.3, 51.9, 52.5 and 53.3 ppm which correspond <lb/>to carbon atoms of piperazine ring. The carbon atom of the <lb/>methylene linker at the acetamide fragment occurred as <lb/>peak at d 54.1 ppm. The peaks of carbon atoms of the <lb/>aromatic rings were detected at the expected chemical <lb/>shifts within the range d 111.7-146.3 ppm. The peak at <lb/>172.1 ppm was ascribed to a carbon in a carbonyl group. <lb/>The 1 H NMR spectrum of 13 revealed two multiplets <lb/>within the range of d 1.59-1.88 and 2.96-3.56 ppm which <lb/>were ascribed to eight protons of the morpholine ring. The <lb/>methylene linker at the acetamide fragment occurred as <lb/>singlet at d 4.15 ppm. Four aromatic protons gave three <lb/>multiplets and on triplet within the range of d <lb/>7.13-7.86 ppm. The amide (NH) proton appeared as broad <lb/>singlet at d 10.05 ppm. The proton of protonated mor-<lb/>pholine fragment (?NH) was observed as broad singlet at d <lb/>11.41 ppm. The 13 C NMR spectrum of 13 showed five <lb/>peaks at d 51.8, 52.6, 53.2, 67.8 and 68.6 ppm which <lb/>correspond to carbon atoms of morpholine ring and the <lb/>methylene linker at the acetamide fragment. The aromatic <lb/>carbons in the benzene ring were observed as six peaks <lb/>within the range d 117.8-138.1 ppm.

			<body>could potentially be used to screen for anticonvulsant ac-<lb/>tivity, the MES model and the subcutaneous pentylenete-<lb/>trazole (scPTZ) model remain the &apos;&apos;gold standards&apos;&apos; in the <lb/>early stages of testing. The MES test is the mechanism-<lb/>independent animal seizure model which enables identifi-<lb/>cation of compounds preventing seizure spread. This test <lb/>uses an electrical stimulus to produce generalized tonic-<lb/>clonic seizures and thus is thought to be an experimental <lb/>model of tonic-clonic epilepsy and of partial convulsions <lb/>with or without secondary generalization in humans. The <lb/>scPTZ test employs chemically induced myoclonic sei-<lb/>zures and is proposed to identify the agents raising the <lb/>seizure threshold. This test is related to human generalized <lb/>absence seizures (Rogawski, 2006). <lb/>Considering the aforementioned facts, the profile of <lb/>anticonvulsant activity of final compounds 3-24 was <lb/>Scheme 1 Synthetic pathways of intermediates 1, 2 and target compounds 3-24 <lb/></body>

			<body>established in the MES and scPTZ tests, after intraperi-<lb/>toneal (i.p.) injection in mice at doses of 30, 100 and <lb/>300 mg/kg. An observation was carried out at two different <lb/>time intervals-0.5 and 4 h. Furthermore, in addition to the <lb/>primary anticonvulsant screening, the acute neurological <lb/>toxicity (NT) was determined in mice by the rotarod test. <lb/>The results of the preliminary pharmacological studies are <lb/>summarized in Table 1. <lb/>The compounds tested showed protection exclusively in <lb/>the MES seizures. Furthermore, in vivo data revealed that <lb/>anticonvulsant activity was closely connected with the type <lb/>of substituent at the 3-position of the anilide moiety. Ex-<lb/>cept for N-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)ac-<lb/>etamide (12)-effective in the MES test at 0.5 h (dose of <lb/>100 mg/kg) and N-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-morpholino-ac-<lb/>etamide (13) which showed protection in both time points <lb/>(100 mg/kg at 0.5 h, and 300 mg/kg at 4 h), all other <lb/>3-chloroanilides (3-11) were devoid of anticonvulsant ac-<lb/>tivity. As it can be seen, considerably higher anticonvulsant <lb/>protection was observed for 3-(trifluoromethyl)anilides <lb/>(14-24). Among these derivatives, all compounds, except <lb/>for those containing 4-(2-chlorophenyl)piperazine (15), <lb/>4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazine (17) and 4-pyrimidin-2-<lb/>yl-piperazine (21), revealed protection in the MES test at <lb/>dose of 100 mg/kg and/or 300 mg/kg in different pre-<lb/>treatment times. The highest anticonvulsant activity was <lb/>observed for 19 which protected animals in both time in-<lb/>tervals (300 mg/kg at 0.5 h, and 100 mg/kg at 4 h). Other <lb/>active compounds with phenylpiperazine fragment as <lb/>amine function (14, 16, 18, 20) revealed protection in the <lb/>MES seizures only 4 h after i.p. administration that means <lb/>delayed onset, however, long in duration anticonvulsant <lb/>action. The anti-MES activity at dose of 100 mg/kg <lb/>showed also morpholine derivative 24 (0.5 h). The differ-<lb/>ences in times points in which the anticonvulsant protec-<lb/>tion was observed for compounds containing morpholine <lb/>(24) or phenylpiperazine moieties (14, 16, 18, 20) may <lb/>result from the lipophilic properties of these molecules. As <lb/>it is presented in Table 1, the more lipophilic molecules <lb/>(higher clog P values)-14, 16, 18, 20 showed activity <lb/>mainly at 4 h, whereas less lipophilic compound 24 was <lb/>effective only at time point of 0.5 h. These observations <lb/>may be connected with higher affinity of more lipophilic <lb/>compounds to the peripheral tissues that causes slower <lb/>distribution to the CNS. The further SAR analysis indicated <lb/>that exchange of phenylpiperazine moiety into ben-<lb/>zylpiperazine (22) or hydroxyethylpiperazine (23) de-<lb/>creased anticonvulsant activity. The screening data <lb/>revealed that all active compounds showed weaker anti-<lb/>MES protection than phenytoin that is still recognized as <lb/>model AED active in MES test. Furthermore, the anti-<lb/>convulsant protection was distinctly lower in comparison <lb/>with respective succinimide analogs described in advance <lb/>(Obniska et al., 2013). This observation confirms the role <lb/>of pyrrolidine-2,5-dione ring as a pharmacophore crucial <lb/>for anticonvulsant activity. <lb/>The pharmacological results obtained in the current <lb/>studies proved that introduction of the fluorine atom or <lb/>trifluoromethyl group was essential for anticonvulsant ac-<lb/>tivity in this series of compounds. Furthermore, it is widely <lb/>accepted that incorporation of fluorine into biologically <lb/>active molecules provides analogs with increased <lb/>metabolic stability due to strength of C-F bond and further <lb/>reduction of cytochrome P450 oxidative metabolism. <lb/>Fig. 5 The HPLC chromatogram of compound 22 <lb/></body>

			<body>Moreover, the unique features of fluorine, such as <lb/>relatively small size, combined with a very high elec-<lb/>tronegativity can specifically modulate the steric and <lb/>electronic properties of the fluorinated derivatives and <lb/>significantly affect biological activity. In addition, incor-<lb/>poration of fluorine residues into aromatic system leads to <lb/>increased lipophilicity and better distribution to CNS (Kirk, <lb/>2006; Song et al., 2005; Ismail, 2002; Smart, 2001). It <lb/>should be stressed here that beneficial influence of fluorine <lb/>substitution on anticonvulsant activity was observed in a <lb/>group of 2-azaspiro[4.4]nonane-and 2-azaspro[4.5]decane-<lb/>1,3-diones described in advance (Obniska et al., 2006). <lb/>In the rotarod test (NT) for acute neurological toxicity, <lb/>most of 3-chloro-as well as 3-(trifluoromethyl)anilides with <lb/>electron-withdrawing substituents (Cl, F, CF 3 ) at the <lb/>phenylpiperazine fragment did not show neurotoxicity in the <lb/>Table 1 Anticonvulsant and neurotoxicity screening after i.p. administration in mice (3-24) <lb/>No. <lb/>R 1 <lb/>R 2 <lb/>X <lb/>R 3 <lb/>Intraperitoneal administration in mice a <lb/>clog P e <lb/>MES b <lb/>scPTZ c <lb/>NT d <lb/>0.5 h <lb/>4 h <lb/>0.5 h <lb/>4 h <lb/>0.5 h <lb/>4 h <lb/>3 <lb/>Cl <lb/>H <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>3.15 <lb/>4 <lb/>Cl <lb/>2-Cl <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>3.71 <lb/>5 <lb/>Cl <lb/>4-Cl <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>3.71 <lb/>6 <lb/>Cl <lb/>2,3-Cl <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>4.26 <lb/>7 <lb/>Cl <lb/>2-F <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>3.31 <lb/>8 <lb/>Cl <lb/>4-F <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>3.31 <lb/>9 <lb/>Cl <lb/>3-CF 3 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>4.07 <lb/>10 <lb/>Cl <lb/>-<lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>1.72 <lb/>11 <lb/>Cl <lb/>-<lb/>N <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>300 <lb/>-<lb/>2.80 <lb/>12 <lb/>Cl <lb/>-<lb/>N <lb/>-CH 3 <lb/>100 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>1.07 <lb/>13 <lb/>Cl <lb/>-<lb/>O <lb/>-<lb/>100 <lb/>300 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>300 <lb/>-<lb/>0.92 <lb/>14 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>H <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>100 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>300 Z <lb/>300 <lb/>3.51 <lb/>15 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>2-Cl <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>4.07 <lb/>16 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>4-Cl <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>100 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>4.07 <lb/>17 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>2,3-Cl <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>4.63 <lb/>18 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>2-F <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>100 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>3.67 <lb/>19 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>4-F <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>300 <lb/>100 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>300 <lb/>-<lb/>3.67 <lb/>20 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>3-CF 3 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>100 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>4.43 <lb/>21 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>-<lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>300 <lb/>-<lb/>2.09 <lb/>22 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>-<lb/>N <lb/>300 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>300 33 <lb/>-<lb/>3.17 <lb/>23 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>-<lb/>N <lb/>-(CH 2 ) 2 -OH <lb/>300 <lb/>300 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>300 <lb/>-<lb/>0.92 <lb/>24 <lb/>CF 3 <lb/>-<lb/>O <lb/>-<lb/>100 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>100 <lb/>-<lb/>1.28 <lb/>Phenytoin f <lb/>30 <lb/>30 <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>100 <lb/>100 <lb/>Response comments: Z respiratory depression, 33 tremors <lb/>a Doses of 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg were administered intraperitoneally.

			<body>maximum dose administered (300 mg/kg). The other <lb/>derivatives, namely 11, 13, 14, 19, 21-23 showed neuro-<lb/>toxicity at a dose of 300 mg/kg. At the same dose, mice <lb/>showed respiratory depression after administration of 14 and <lb/>revealed tremors after administration of 22. Only one <lb/>compound 24 revealed neurotoxicity at a dose of 100 mg/kg. <lb/>According to the Anticonvulsant Screening Project dis-<lb/>positions, three compounds 13, 20 and 22 which showed <lb/>protection in mice were selected and examined for their <lb/>anticonvulsant activity (MES screen) and neurotoxicity <lb/>after oral (p.o.) administration in rats at fixed dose 30 mg/ <lb/>kg. This screen discloses the time of onset, the approximate <lb/>time of peak effect (TPE) and the duration of anticonvul-<lb/>sant activity or neurotoxicity. The results are shown in <lb/>Table 2. <lb/>Among derivatives tested, only 20 was active in 50 % of <lb/>animals at time point 2 h. This compound was also active <lb/>in 25 % of animals at 0.5 h. The other molecules revealed <lb/>25 % protection at 0.5 h (13) and in all five time intervals <lb/>(25). All compounds given orally did not cause motor <lb/>impairment in the rotarod screen (data not indicated in <lb/>Table 2). The compounds tested showed lower activity <lb/>than phenytoin which protected from 25 to 100 % of mice <lb/>in different time intervals. <lb/>On the basis of the preliminary data in rats, compound <lb/>20 was chosen for quantification of the pharmacological <lb/>parameters (ED 50 and TD 50 ) after p.o. application. The <lb/>quantitative evaluation of the MES median effective dose <lb/>(ED 50 ) and toxic dose (TD 50 ) was performed at previously <lb/>estimated TPE-2 h. The results of the quantitative tests <lb/>along with data for the standard AEDs-valproic acid, <lb/>ethosuximide and phenytoin-are listed in Table 3. <lb/>The quantitative data showed that 20 had higher ED 50 <lb/>than phenytoin (MES test), however, was distinctly more <lb/>potent than valproic acid in this seizure model. It should be <lb/>emphasized that in both cases 20 revealed more favorable <lb/>protective indexes in comparison with mentioned model <lb/>AEDs. Furthermore, substance 20 was almost twice weaker <lb/>in the MES test than model succinimides presented in <lb/>Fig. 2. These results support strongly crucial role of suc-<lb/>cinimide ring for anticonvulsant activity. <lb/>In the next step of pharmacological investigations, four <lb/>compounds 12, 19, 20 and 24 were chosen for the <lb/>evaluation of anticonvulsant activity in the psychomotor <lb/>6-Hz test (Table 4). The selection was made randomly as a <lb/>part of the search of molecules providing anti-6-Hz pro-<lb/>tection among chemically diversified compounds pursued <lb/>in the NIH/NINDS.

			<body>of anticonvulsant action. One example supporting this <lb/>hypothesis is provided by levetiracetam, which has <lb/>demonstrated efficacy in refractory human partial epilep-<lb/>sies. It was found to be inactive against classical MES and <lb/>PTZ seizures even at high doses, whereas showed high <lb/>effectiveness in the 6-Hz psychomotor seizure model of <lb/>partial epilepsy (Rogawski, 2006). Thus, it is suggested <lb/>that the 6-Hz model might be capable for identifying anti-<lb/>seizure agents with a novel spectrum of activity and un-<lb/>known mechanism of anticonvulsant action. <lb/>The results obtained showed the most potent activity for <lb/>morpholine derivative 24 which protected 100 % of mice <lb/>at 0.25 h, 75 % of animals at 1 h and 50 % of animals at <lb/>0.5 h at a dose of 100 mg/kg after (i.p.). Compound 12 <lb/>protected 75 % of animals at 0.25 and 0.5 h. The other <lb/>compounds 19 and 20 were less active and protected 25 % <lb/>of animals at 4 h (19) as well as at 0.25, 2 and 4 h (20). <lb/>None of these compounds caused motor impairment during <lb/>mentioned studies. <lb/>In vitro sodium channels radioligand binding studies <lb/>Intensive studies into the physiological and biochemical <lb/>events taking place during epileptic seizures have provided <lb/>insight into the molecular mechanisms by which these <lb/>might be controlled. The fundamental role in establishing <lb/>and regulating excitability of CNS neurons as well as <lb/>suppression of seizures is ascribed to voltage-gated sodium <lb/>channels (VGSCs) (Meldrum and Rogawski, 2007). Thus, <lb/>the brain sodium channels are the molecular targets of <lb/>numerous chemically diverse AEDs from which phenytoin <lb/>and carbamazepine are the most representative (Rogawski <lb/>and Lo ¨scher, 2004; Liu et al., 2003; Bialer et al., 2009). <lb/>Using radioligand binding techniques, Catterall and asso-<lb/>ciates have found an allosteric interaction between these <lb/>drugs and the batrachotoxin (BTX) binding site of sodium <lb/>channels from rat brain (Willow and Catterall, 1982; Cat-<lb/>terall et al., 1981). Phenytoin and carbamazepine block the <lb/>influx of sodium into rat brain synaptosomes elicited by <lb/>BTX, which activates sodium channels (Willow et al., <lb/>1984). Electrophysiological studies of neuroblastoma cells <lb/>demonstrate a frequency-and voltage-dependent blockade <lb/>of sodium currents by both of these anticonvulsants (Wil-<lb/>low et al., 1985; Matsuki et al., 1984). These findings <lb/>suggest that blockade of sodium channel activity by these <lb/>agents underlies their anticonvulsant actions. It should be <lb/>stressed here that such mode of action is characteristic for <lb/>compounds active in the MES seizure test in animals. Due <lb/>to activity of reported compounds in the MES seizures, <lb/>for the most active molecule 20, the binding assays <lb/>for Na? channel (site 2) were performed using the [ 3 H] <lb/>batrachotoxin as radioligand (Brown, 1986). Compound <lb/>binding was calculated as a percent inhibition of the <lb/>binding of a radioactively labeled ligand. The inhibition <lb/>values for 20 were obtained in four concentrations, 1, 10, <lb/>100, and 500 lM. All experiments were performed in du-<lb/>plicate. The results are given in Table 5. <lb/>As it can be seen, compound 20 was observed as a <lb/>moderate binder to the neuronal voltage-sensitive sodium <lb/>channel at the highest concentration-500 lM. This result <lb/>may suggest different mechanism of anticonvulsant action <lb/>than only influence on VGSCs. <lb/>Experimental <lb/>Chemistry <lb/>All the chemicals and solvents were purchased from Sig-<lb/>ma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA) and were used without further <lb/>purification. Melting points (mp.) were determined in open <lb/>capillaries on a Bu ¨chi 353 melting point apparatus (Bu ¨chi <lb/>Labortechnik, Flawil, Switzerland) and are uncorrected. <lb/>HPLC analyses were run on a HPLC Waters Ò 2695 <lb/>Separation Module equipped with photodiode array de-<lb/>tector (Waters Ò 2998). A Chromolith RP-18 SpeedROD <lb/>column (4.6 9 50 mm) was used. Conditions applied were <lb/>as follows: eluent A (water/0.1 % TFA), eluent B (ace-<lb/>tonitrile/0.1 % TFA), flow rate 5 ml/min, gradient of <lb/>0-100 % B over 3 min were used, and injection volume <lb/>was 10 ll.

Male albino mice (CF#1 strain, <lb/>weighing 18-25 g) and male albino rats (Sprague-Dawley) <lb/>were used as experimental animals. The animals were housed <lb/>in metabolic cages and allowed free access to food and water. <lb/>The compounds were injected intraperitoneally to mice as a <lb/>suspension in 0.5 % methylcellulose/water mixture at a dose <lb/>level 30, 100 or 300 mg/kg with anticonvulsant activity and <lb/>neurotoxicity assessment at 0.5 and 4 h after administration. <lb/>Promising derivatives from phase I underwent phase VIa in <lb/>which they were administrated orally into rats at a fixed dose <lb/>of 30 mg/kg for both MES and the rotarod toxicity determi-<lb/>nation at five pretreatment times: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 h. Groups of <lb/>eight mice or four rats are employed. <lb/>Maximal electroshock seizure test (MES) <lb/>In the MES screen, an electrical stimulus of 0.2 s in du-<lb/>ration (50 mA in mice and 150 mA in rats) is delivered via <lb/>corneal electrodes primed with an electrolyte solution <lb/>containing an anesthetic agent. The endpoint is the tonic <lb/>extension of the hind limbs. In the control groups, the <lb/>procedures cause immediate hind limb tonic extension. <lb/>Mice not displaying hind limb tonic extension are consid-<lb/>ered to be protected from seizures. <lb/>Subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole seizure test (scPTZ) <lb/>The scPTZ test utilizes a dose of pentylenetetrazole <lb/>(85 mg/kg in mice) that produces clonic seizures lasting for <lb/>a period of at least 5 s in 97 % (CD 97 ) of animals tested. <lb/>PTZ is administered 0.5 and 4 h after injections of tested <lb/>compounds, and observation is carried out for 30 min. In <lb/>the control groups, the first episode of clonic convulsions is <lb/>observed between 6 and 15 min of observation. The ab-<lb/>sence of clonic convulsions in the observed time period of <lb/>0.5 and 4 h is interpreted as the compound&apos;s ability to <lb/>protect against PTZ-induced seizures. <lb/>Neurotoxicity screening <lb/>The neurological toxicity test (NT) induced by a compound <lb/>was detected in mice or rats using standardized rotarod test <lb/>(Dunham and Miya, 1957). Untreated control mice or rats, <lb/>when placed on the rod, can maintained their equilibrium for <lb/>a prolonged time period. The acute motor impairment can be <lb/>demonstrated by the inability of the animal to maintain <lb/>equilibrium for 1 min in each of three successive trials. <lb/>The psychomotor 6-Hz model <lb/>The 6-Hz model is an alternative electroshock paradigm <lb/>that uses low-frequency (6 Hz), long-duration (3 s) elec-<lb/>trical stimulation. Corneal stimulation (0.2 ms duration <lb/>monopolar rectangular pulses at 6-Hz for 3 s) was deliv-<lb/>ered by a constant-current device. During the stimulation, <lb/>mice were manually restrained and released into the ob-<lb/>servation cage immediately after the current application. <lb/>The seizures manifest in &apos;&apos;stunned&apos;&apos; posture associated with <lb/>rearing, forelimb, automatic movements and clonus, <lb/>twitching the vibrissae and Straub-tail. The duration of the <lb/>seizure activity ranges from 60 to 120 s in untreated ani-<lb/>mals. At the end of the seizure, animals resume their nor-<lb/>mal exploratory behavior. The experimental end point is <lb/>protection against the seizure. The animal is considered to <lb/>be protected if it resumes its normal exploratory behavior <lb/>within 10 s from the stimulation (Brown et al., 1953). <lb/>In vitro studies-sodium channel binding assay <lb/>The radioligand binding studies were performed commer-<lb/>cially in Cerep Laboratories (Poitiers, France) using testing <lb/></body>

The results of in vivo pharmacological studies <lb/>showed activity exclusively in the MES seizures especially <lb/>for 3-(trifluoromethyl)anilide derivatives, whereas majority <lb/>of 3-chloroanilide analogs were inactive. Several mole-<lb/>cules showed activity in the 6-Hz screen that may indicate <lb/>their potential usefulness in partial and therapy-resistant <lb/>epilepsy. The pharmacophoric role of the pyrrolidine-2,5-<lb/>dione ring for anticonvulsant properties was proved. <lb/></body>
