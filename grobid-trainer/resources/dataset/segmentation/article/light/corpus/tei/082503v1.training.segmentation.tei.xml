Here, we investigate the evolution of social behavior <lb/>in structured populations under arbitrary mutation probabilities. We consider <lb/>populations of fixed size N , structured such that in the absence of selection, all <lb/>individuals have the same probability of reproducing or dying (neutral repro-<lb/>ductive values are the all same). Two types of individuals, A and B , correspond-<lb/>ing to two types of social behavior, are competiting; the fidelity of strategy trans-<lb/>mission from parent to offspring is tuned by a parameter µ. Social interactions <lb/>have a direct effect on individual fecundities. Under the assumption of small <lb/>phenotypic differences (weak selection), we provide a formula for the expected <lb/>frequency of type A individuals in the population, and deduce conditions for <lb/>the long-term success of one strategy against another. We then illustrate this <lb/>result with three common life-cycles (Wright-Fisher, Moran Birth-Death and <lb/>Moran Death-Birth), and specific population structures (graph-structured pop-<lb/>ulations). Qualitatively, we find that some life-cycles (Moran Birth-Death, Wright-<lb/>Fisher) prevent the evolution of altruistic behavior, confirming previous results <lb/>obtained with perfect strategy transmission. We also show that computing the <lb/>expected frequency of altruists on a regular graph may require knowing more <lb/>than just the graph&apos;s size and degree. <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Most models on the evolution of social behavior in structured populations study <lb/>the outcome of competition between individuals having different strategies and <lb/>assume that strategy transmission from parents to their offspring is almost per-<lb/>fect (i.e., when considering genetic transmission, that mutation is either vanish-<lb/>ingly small or absent). This is for instance illustrated by the use of fixation prob-<lb/>abilities to assess evolutionary success (e.g., Nowak et al., 2004; Nowak, 2006; <lb/>Ohtsuki et al., 2006). Yet, mutation has been shown to affect the evolutionary <lb/>fate of social behavior (Frank, 1997; Tarnita et al., 2009) and is, more generally, <lb/>a potentially important evolutionary force. Here, we explore the role of imper-<lb/>fect strategy transmission-genetic or cultural-from parents to offspring on the <lb/>evolution of social behavior, when two types of individuals, with different social <lb/>strategies, are competing. We are interested in evaluating the long-term success <lb/>of one strategy over another. <lb/>A population in which mutation is not close (or equal) to zero will spend a <lb/>non-negligible time in mixed states (i.e., in states where both types of individ-<lb/>uals are present), so instead of fixation probabilities, we need to consider long-<lb/>term frequencies to assess evolutionary success (Tarnita et al., 2009; Wakano &amp; <lb/>Lehmann, 2014; Tarnita &amp; Taylor, 2014). We will say that a strategy is favored <lb/>by selection when its expected frequency is larger than what it would be in the <lb/>absence of selection. <lb/>In this study, we consider populations such that, in the absence of selection <lb/>(when social interactions have no effect on fitness), all individuals have equal <lb/>chances of reproducing, and equal chances of dying. In other words, in such a <lb/></body>

			<body>population of size N , the neutral reproductive value of each site is 1/N (Taylor, <lb/>1990; Maciejewski, 2014; Tarnita &amp; Taylor, 2014). We provide a formula that gives <lb/>the long-term frequency of a social strategy in any such population, for arbitrary <lb/>mutation rates, and for any life-cycle (provided population size remains equal <lb/>to N ). This formula is a function of the probabilities that pairs of individuals <lb/>are identical by descent. These probabilities are obtained by solving a linear <lb/>system of equations, and we present explicit solutions for population structures <lb/>with a high level of symmetry (structures that we call &quot;n-dimensional graphs&quot;). <lb/>We finally illustrate our results with widely used updating rules (Moran models, <lb/>Wright-Fisher model) and specific population structures. <lb/>2 Models and Methods <lb/>Population structures <lb/>We consider a population of fixed size N , where each individual inhabits a site <lb/>corresponding to the node of a graph D; each site hosts exactly one individual. <lb/>The edges of the graph, {d i j } 1≤i , j ≤N , define where individuals can send their <lb/>offspring to; we consider graphs D that are connected, i.e., such that following <lb/>the edges of the graph, we can go from any node to any other node. Another <lb/>graph, E, with the same nodes as graph D but with edges {e i j } 1≤i , j ≤N , defines <lb/>the social interactions between the individuals; E can be the same graph as D, <lb/>but does not have to be (Taylor et al., 2007a; Ohtsuki et al., 2007; Débarre et al., <lb/>2014). The edges of the two graphs can be weighted (i.e., d i j and e i j can take <lb/>any non-negative value) and directed (i.e., we can have d i j = d j i or e i j = e j i for <lb/>some sites i and j ). Finally, we denote by D and E the adjacency matrices of the <lb/></body>

			<body>dispersal and interaction graphs, respectively. <lb/>Regular dispersal graphs In this study, we focus on dispersal graphs that are <lb/>regular, i.e., such that for all sites i , the sum of the edges to i and the sum of the <lb/>edges from i are both equal to ν: <lb/>N <lb/>j =1 <lb/>d i j = <lb/>N <lb/>j =1 <lb/>d j i = ν, <lb/>(1) <lb/>where ν is called degree of the graph when the graph is unweighted. All the <lb/>graphs depicted in the article satisfy eq. (1). Note that there is no specific con-<lb/>straint on the interaction graph E. <lb/>More detailed results are then obtained for regular graphs that display some <lb/>level of symmetry, that we now describe: <lb/>Transitive dispersal graphs A transitive graph is such that for any two nodes <lb/>i and j of the graph, there is an isomorphism that maps i to j (Taylor et al., <lb/>2007a; ?); in other words, the graph looks the same from every node. In figure 1, <lb/>graphs (b)-(e) are transitive. <lb/>Transitive undirected dispersal graphs A graph is undirected if for any <lb/>two nodes i and j , d i j = d j i . In figure 1, graphs (b), (c), (e) are both transitive <lb/>and undirected. <lb/>&quot;n-dimensional&quot; dispersal graphs We call &quot;n-dimensional graphs&quot; tran-<lb/>sitive graphs whose nodes can be relabelled with n-long indices, such that the <lb/>graph is unchanged by circular permutation of the indices in each dimension. <lb/></body>

The graphs on the first line are <lb/>unoriented and unweighted graphs of degree ν = 3; Graph (d) is oriented, graph (e) <lb/>is weighted. (a) is the Frucht graph, and has no symmetry. Graphs (b) and (d) are <lb/>one-dimensional, graphs (c) and (e) are two-dimensional (see main text). <lb/>The graphs can be directed and weighted. We denote by N the ensemble of <lb/>node indices: N = {0, . . . , N 1 −1}×• • •×{0, . . . , N n −1}, with n <lb/>k=1 N n = N ; number-<lb/>ing is done modulo N k in dimension k. Then for all indices i , j and l of N , node <lb/>labelling is such that for all edges (modulo the size of each dimension), <lb/>d i j = d i +k, j +k . <lb/>(2) <lb/>In figure 1, graphs (b) and (d) are 1-dimensional: we can label their nodes such <lb/>that the adjacency matrices are circulant. Graphs (c) and (e) are 2-dimensional: <lb/>the adjacency matrices are block-circulant, with each block being circulant. In <lb/>1(c), one dimension corresponds to the angular position of a node (N 1 = 6 posi-<lb/>tions), and the other dimension to the radial position of a node (N 2 = 2 positions, <lb/></body>

In 2(e), one dimension corresponds to the horizontal <lb/>position of a node (N 1 = 4 positions) and the other to the vertical position of a <lb/>node (N 2 = 3 positions). Condition eq. (2) may sound strong, but is satisfied for <lb/>the regular population structures classically studied, like stepping-stones (e.g., <lb/>cycle graphs, lattices), or island models (Taylor, 2010; Taylor et al., 2011). <lb/>Types of individuals and social interactions <lb/>There are two types (A and B ) of individuals in the population, corresponding to <lb/>two strategies of social behavior. There are no mixed strategies: an individual of <lb/>type A plays strategy A, and individuals do not change strategies. The indicator <lb/>variable X i represents the type of the individual present at site i : X i is equal to 1 <lb/>if the individual at site i is of type A, and X i is equal to 0 otherwise (X i = 1 A (i )). <lb/>A N -long vector X gathers the identities of all individuals in the population, and <lb/>X is the population average of X (X = N <lb/>i =1 X i /N ). <lb/>Individuals in the population reproduce asexually. Fecundities are affected <lb/>by social interactions, and are gathered in a N -long vector f . We assume that <lb/>the genotype-phenotype map is such that the two types A and B are close in <lb/>phenotype space: the individual living at site i expresses a phenotype δX i , with <lb/>δ 1 (a feature called &quot;δ-weak selection&quot; by Wild &amp; Traulsen (2007)). <lb/>An individual&apos;s fecundity depends on its own phenotype and on its interac-<lb/>tion neighborhood. Interaction neighborhoods are determined by the interac-<lb/>tion graph E, and the effect of social interactions on fecundity are given by a <lb/></body>

			<body>function φ. We assume that the baseline fecundity is φ(0, 0) = 1, so that <lb/>f i (X , δ) = φ δX i , <lb/>l <lb/>e l i δX l <lb/>= 1 + δ X i ∂ (1) φ(0, 0) + <lb/>l <lb/>e l i X l ∂ (2) φ(0, 0) + O(δ 2 ), <lb/>(3a) <lb/>where ∂ (n) φ(0, 0) represents the partial derivative of φ with respect to its n th ele-<lb/>ment, evaluated at (0, 0), and l refers to the sum N <lb/>l =1 . If we write b = ∂ (2) φ(0, 0) <lb/>and −c = ∂ (1) φ(0, 0), then eq. (3a) becomes <lb/>f i (X , δ) = 1 + δ −cX i + b <lb/>l <lb/>e l i X l + O(δ 2 ). <lb/>(3b) <lb/>Our results are valid for any b and c, but throughout the article, we will consider <lb/>the case where b &gt; 0 and c &gt; 0, so that type-A individuals are &quot;altruists&quot;, and <lb/>we will seek to understand the impact of imperfect strategy transmission on the <lb/>frequency of altruists. When δ = 0, all individuals in the population, whichever <lb/>their type, have the same fecundity: the trait is then neutral. <lb/>Reproduction and mutation <lb/>The expected number of successful offspring established at site j at the next <lb/>time step, descending from the individual who is living at site i at the current <lb/>time step, is denoted by B j i ( f (X , δ)), written B j i for simplicity. &quot;Successful off-<lb/>spring&quot; of a focal individual means individuals who descend from this focal in-<lb/>dividual and who are alive and established at the start of the next time step. <lb/>Because there is exactly one individual per site, 0 ≤ B j i ≤ 1. Mutation among <lb/>offspring occurs with probability µ, 0 &lt; µ ≤ 1; when mutation occurs, the off-<lb/></body>

			<body>spring are of type A with probability p and of type B otherwise (0 &lt; p &lt; 1). For <lb/>instance, under this mutation scheme, the offspring of an individual of type A <lb/>is also of type A with probability 1 − µ + µp (Taylor et al., 2007b; Nowak et al., <lb/>2010; Tarnita &amp; Taylor, 2014). The parameter p controls the asymmetry of muta-<lb/>tion, and it is also the expected frequency of type-A individuals in the absence <lb/>of selection (i.e., when δ = 0). Although we use the word &quot;mutation&quot;, which hints <lb/>at a genetic transmission of the trait, this framework can also describe vertical <lb/>cultural transmission, so µ does not have to be small. The mutation probability, <lb/>however, cannot be zero; if it were, the all-A and all-B states would be absorb-<lb/>ing: we would end up either with only type-A or only type-B individuals in the <lb/>population, and we would not be able to define a stationary distribution of pop-<lb/>ulation states-for similar reasons, p cannot be 0 nor 1. <lb/>We denote by D i ( f (X , δ)) (or D i for simplicity) the probability that the indi-<lb/>vidual living at site i is dead at the beginning of the next time step, given that the <lb/>population is currently in state X . This probability of death at site i can be ex-<lb/>pressed as a function of the probabilities of birth and establishment of offspring <lb/>at site i , summing over the locations j of the potential parents: <lb/>D i = <lb/>N <lb/>j =1 <lb/>B i j . <lb/>(4) <lb/>There is exactly one individual per site, so at a given site i , there can be at most <lb/>one successfully established offspring at each time step, and 0 ≤ D i ≤ 1. On the <lb/>other hand, the expected number of offspring of the parent currently living at <lb/></body>

			<body>site i is 0 ≤ N <lb/>j =1 B j i ≤ N . We denote by <lb/>W i = <lb/>N <lb/>j =1 <lb/>B j i + (1 − D i ) <lb/>(5) <lb/>the expected contribution to the next time step of the individual living in site j : <lb/>this includes this individual&apos;s successful offspring, and the individual itself if it <lb/>survived-a quantity that we can also refer to as &quot;fitness&quot;. <lb/>Finally, we are considering population structures such that in the absence of <lb/>selection (δ = 0), all individuals have the same probability of reproducing, and <lb/>all individuals have the same probability of dying-meaning that all sites in the <lb/>population have the same reproductive value 1/N (Taylor, 1990; Caswell, 2001; <lb/>Maciejewski, 2014); this implies that for all sites i <lb/>N <lb/>j =1 <lb/>B j i ( f (X , 0)) = B * = D i ( f (X , 0)). <lb/>(6) <lb/>Life-cycles <lb/>Most of our results are derived without specifying a life-cycle (also called &quot;up-<lb/>dating rule&quot;). In the Illustrations section, we will give specific examples using <lb/>classical life-cycles: Moran models (Birth-Death and Death-Birth), with exactly <lb/>one birth and one death during a time step, and the Wright-Fisher model, where <lb/>all adults die and are replaced by new individuals at the end of a time step. <lb/></body>

			<body>3 Results <lb/>Expected frequency of type-A individuals in the population <lb/>We describe here the key steps of the computation of the expected frequency <lb/>of type-A individuals in the population and refer the reader to Appendix A for <lb/>mathematical details. <lb/>The expected frequency of type-A individuals in the population, denoted by <lb/>E X , can be computed from the stationary distribution of population states, <lb/>considering what happens during one during step. We denote by Ω the set of <lb/>all possible states of the population and by ξ(X , δ, µ) the probability that the <lb/>population is in state X , in a model with strength of selection (phenotype dif-<lb/>ferences) δ and mutation probability µ (ξ is the stationary distribution of pop-<lb/>ulation states). Given state X of the population, at the end of the time step, the <lb/>state of the individual living at site i depends on whether it has survived dur-<lb/>ing the time step (first term within the brackets of eq. (7)), and, if it has been <lb/>replaced, on the type of the newly established offspring (second term within the <lb/>brackets); we then take the expectation over all population states, and obtain: <lb/>E X = <lb/>X ∈Ω <lb/>1 <lb/>N <lb/>N <lb/>i =1 <lb/>(1 − D i )X i + <lb/>N <lb/>j =1 <lb/>B i j X j (1 − µ) + µp ξ(X , δ, µ). <lb/>(7) <lb/>This is the expected frequency of type-A individuals in the population. For in-<lb/>stance, if we run a simulation of the model for a very long time, the average over <lb/>time of the frequency of type-A individuals will provide an estimation of E X ; <lb/>this quantity does not depend on the initial state of the population. <lb/>We then assume that selection is weak, i.e., δ is small, and write a first-order <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>expansion of eq. (7) that contains derivatives of ξ, D i and B i j with respect to δ. <lb/>For the last two, we further use the chain rule with the variables f k , which rep-<lb/>resent the fecundity of the individual living at site k. In doing so, we let appear <lb/>quantities that are the expectations of the state of pairs of sites when no selec-<lb/>tion is acting (i.e., when δ = 0; we call these &quot;neutral expectations&quot; and ξ(X , 0, µ) <lb/>is called neutral stationary distribution): <lb/>P j k = <lb/>X ∈Ω <lb/>X j X k ξ(X , 0, µ) = E 0 X j X k . <lb/>(8) <lb/>The fact that these neutral expectations appear in our equations does not <lb/>mean that selection is initially not acting and then &quot;turned on&quot;: selection is act-<lb/>ing all the time, but it is weak because phenotypic differences are small (δ 1). <lb/>At the first order in δ, we can ignore the effect of selection on the expected state <lb/>of pairs of sites, and this is why we only need neutral expectations (eq. (8)). <lb/>Eventually, we deduce that the expected frequency of individuals of type A <lb/>in the population can be written as <lb/>E X ≈ p + <lb/>δ <lb/>µB * <lb/>βb − γc <lb/>N <lb/>, <lb/>(9) <lb/>with <lb/>β = <lb/>j ,k,l i <lb/>(1 − µ) ∂ f k B i j − ∂ f k D j e l k P j l + µ <lb/>i , j ,k,l <lb/>∂ f k B i j e l k p 2 , <lb/>(10a) <lb/>γ = <lb/>j ,k i <lb/>(1 − µ) ∂ f k B i j − ∂ f k D j P j k + µ <lb/>i , j ,k <lb/>∂ f k B i j p 2 , <lb/>(10b) <lb/>with P as defined in eq. (8) and ∂ f k being a shorthand notation for ∂ <lb/>∂ f k δ=0 <lb/>. Eq. (9) <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>is an approximation at the first order in δ (we neglect terms in δ 2 and higher). A <lb/>weak mutation approximation of eq. (9) is presented in Appendix A.4. <lb/>The formulas for β and γ (eq. (10a)-eq. (10b)) are still implicit, because we <lb/>need to evaluate the P i j terms, which we now do. <lb/>Expected state of pairs of sites at neutrality <lb/>We recall that P i j , defined in eq. (8), is also the probability that both sites i and j <lb/>are occupied by individuals of type A, at neutrality (i.e., when δ = 0). Under van-<lb/>ishing mutation (µ → 0), convenient connections can be made between identity <lb/>in state and identity-by-descent (Cockerham &amp; Weir, 1993; Rousset et al., 2000), <lb/>and then with coalescence times (Slatkin, 1991, 1993; Rousset, 2004; Allen et al., <lb/>2012). Here as well, we can characterize P i j in terms of probabilities of identity-<lb/>by-descent, Q i j . Two individuals at sites i and j are said to be identical by de-<lb/>scent (IBD) if they share a common ancestor and if no mutation occurred in <lb/>their lineages since this common ancestor (Kimura &amp; Crow, 1964, note though <lb/>that the original definition is with an infinite allele model, where each mutation <lb/>creates a new allele). If two individuals are IBD, then they are both of type A <lb/>with probability p, the expected state of a single individual at neutrality. If two <lb/>individuals are not IBD, then they are both of type A with probability p 2 . Sim-<lb/>plifying, we obtain <lb/>P i j = p 2 +Q i j p (1 − p) <lb/>(11) <lb/> (Allen &amp; Nowak, 2014) (see Appendix B.1 for more details). Eq. (11) also valid <lb/>when i = j . So we can work with IBD relationships. <lb/>To find the probabilities of identity-by-descent, we first write the probability <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>that two individuals at sites i and j are IBD given the state X of the population at <lb/>the previous time step, and then take the expectation of this conditional prob-<lb/>ability. We can still do so without specifying the way the population is updated <lb/>(using notation as in Allen et al. (2015)), and the resulting equation is presented <lb/>in Appendix B.1, eq. (B.1). This equation can also be adapted to specific up-<lb/>dating rules, as shown in the Illustrations section (details of the calculations are <lb/>provided in Appendix B). <lb/>Keeping in mind that Q i j = Q j i and that Q i i = 1, we then have to solve a <lb/>linear system of N (N − 1)/2 equations to obtain explicit formulas for all the Q i j <lb/>terms, for any regular graph. More explicit formulas for Q i j can be found for <lb/>regular graphs, and in particular for n-dimensional graphs, as we will see in the <lb/>Illustrations section. Finally, we can gather all probabilities of identity by de-<lb/>scent in a matrix Q. <lb/>Back to the expected frequency of type-A individuals <lb/>Using the relationship between the expected state of pairs of sites P i j and prob-<lb/>abilities of identity-by-descent Q i j (eq. (11)), we can rewrite eq. (9) as follows: <lb/>E X ≈ p + δ <lb/>p(1 − p) <lb/>µB * N <lb/>b <lb/>j ,k,l <lb/>e kl ∂ f l W j Q j k − c <lb/>j ,k <lb/>∂ f k W j Q j k , <lb/>(12) <lb/>where as before ∂ f k is a shorthand notation for ∂ <lb/>∂ f k δ=0 <lb/>; W j , the fitness of indi-<lb/>vidual j , was defined in eq. (5). <lb/>Interpretation For each focal individual at site k, we consider the influence <lb/>that this individual can have on an identical-by-descent individual at site j (Q j k ). <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>The focal k can directly provide a benefit to j (b e k j ) and hence affect j &apos;s fitness <lb/>(∂ f j W j ), but k can also provide a benefit to another individual l (b e kl ), and the <lb/>resulting change of l &apos;s fecundity affects j &apos;s fitness (∂ f l W j ). By paying the cost of <lb/>being of type A (c), k affects its own fitness (∂ f k W k ) but also indirectly the fitness <lb/>of j (∂ f k W j ). <lb/>Structure parameter We say that a strategy is favored if its frequency at the <lb/>mutation-selection-drift equilibrium is higher than what it would be in the ab-<lb/>sence of selection. For type A, this translates into E X &gt; p . With eq. (12), this <lb/>condition becomes <lb/>j ,k,l e kl ∂ f l W j Q j k <lb/>j ,k ∂ f k W j Q j k <lb/>κ <lb/>b − c &gt; 0. <lb/>(13) <lb/>Hence, a single parameter, κ, summarizes, for a given life-cycle, the structure <lb/>of the population and the effect of mutation (Tarnita et al., 2009; Taylor &amp; Ma-<lb/>ciejewski, 2012); κ is interpreted as a scaled coefficient of relatedness, that in-<lb/>cludes the effect of competition (Lehmann &amp; Rousset, 2010). <lb/>4 Illustrations <lb/>Updating rules <lb/>The results presented so far were valid for any updating rule, provided it is such <lb/>that population size remains equal to N . We now express the expected frequency <lb/>of type-A individuals for specific updating rules, commonly used in studies on <lb/>the evolution of altruistic behavior in structured populations: the Moran model <lb/>and the Wright-Fisher model. Under a Moran model (Moran, 1962), exactly one <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>individual dies and one individual reproduces during one time step; hence, at <lb/>neutrality, B * = 1/N (B * was defined in eq. (6)). The order of the two events <lb/>matters, so two updating rules are distinguished (Ohtsuki &amp; Nowak, 2006; Oht-<lb/>suki et al., 2006): Birth-Death and Death-Birth. In both cases, payoffs are com-<lb/>puted at the start of each time step, before anything happens. <lb/>Moran model, Birth-Death <lb/>Any regular graph Under a Birth-Death (BD) updating, an individual j is cho-<lb/>sen to reproduce with a probability equal to its relative fecundity in the popula-<lb/>tion ( f j / l f l ); then its offspring disperses at random along the D graph, and so <lb/>displaces another individual i with a probability d j i /ν, so that <lb/>B i j = <lb/>f j <lb/>l f l <lb/>d j i <lb/>ν <lb/>, and D j = <lb/>N <lb/>i =1 <lb/>B j i = <lb/>i f i d i j <lb/>ν l f l <lb/>. <lb/>(14) <lb/>Note that with this updating rule, the probability of dying D j depends on the <lb/>composition of the population. With these probabilities of reproducing and dy-<lb/>ing eq. (12) becomes, using the matrix notation, <lb/>E X ≈ p + δ <lb/>p(1 − p) <lb/>µ <lb/>b <lb/>1 <lb/>N <lb/>Tr (E • Q) − <lb/>1 <lb/>N ν <lb/>Tr (E • D • Q) − c 1 − <lb/>1 <lb/>N ν <lb/>Tr (D • Q) , <lb/>(15) <lb/>where Tr (M) denotes the trace of a matrix M, i.e., the sum of its diagonal ele-<lb/>ments. The factors of the benefits b and costs c contain direct (first terms) and <lb/>indirect (second terms) effects. The term Tr (E • Q) /N , associated to direct effects <lb/>of a benefit b, is the average probability of identity by descent with a social inter-<lb/>actant.

			<body>to the effects of a change in fecundity of competitors; with this updating rule, <lb/>competitors are one dispersal step away. Under a Birth-Death updating rule in-<lb/>deed, the survival of an individual at site k is reduced if another individual j <lb/>sends its offspring to site k, an event that occurs if the two are neighbors on <lb/>the dispersal graph (d j k ). So the competition neighborhood is determined by D <lb/>(Grafen &amp; Archetti, 2008). Similarly, the direct cost of a social interaction is dis-<lb/>counted by the effects on competitors (Tr (D • Q) /(N ν)). We can further note that <lb/>for all dispersal graphs, 1 − 1 <lb/>N ν Tr (D • Q) ≥ 0, i.e., that costs are always costly. We <lb/>will see below that benefits are not always beneficial (b&apos;s factor can be negative). <lb/>Probabilities of identity by descent With this updating rule, the probabil-<lb/>ities of identity by descent satisfy, for any i and j = i , <lb/>Q i j = <lb/>1 <lb/>2ν k <lb/>d k j Q ki + d ki Q k j . <lb/>(16) <lb/>(see Appendix B.2 for details on the derivation).

			<body>given by <lb/>Q M = <lb/>1 − (2 − µ)µ <lb/>1 − µ <lb/>, <lb/>(28b) <lb/>and we recover the formula presented in, e.g., Allen et al. (2012) (see Appendix B.2.4 <lb/>for details). This result is plotted in figure 3(c). We however need to note that the <lb/>first-order approximation for E X fails when both µ → 0 and N → ∞: this is <lb/>because the integral behind eq. (28a) does not converge when µ → 0. Similarly, <lb/>for instance, the first order approximation for the probability that two neighbors <lb/>are identical by descent 1−µ(N −1), which was obtained by Taylor et al. (2007a), <lb/>fails when N is too large compared to µ. <lb/>The circle graph is too particular a graph for a Wright-Fisher updating. In-<lb/>deed, while we find the same equation for λ W F as for λ M in this case (eq. (28a)), <lb/>the probability of identity by descent between neighbors is equal to 0. This is <lb/>because all individuals reproduce at each time step, and their offspring can only <lb/>establish on the node on the left or on the right of their parent, so that related-<lb/>ness cannot build up. We can however modify the graph to allow for establish-<lb/>ment in the parent&apos;s node: with probability (1 − m) the offspring remain where <lb/>the parent was, otherwise they move to the right or the left-hand side node (with <lb/>probability m/2 for each; see figure 32(b)).

We provide a formula (eq. (12)) that gives the expected frequency <lb/>of a given strategy, for any life-cycle, any mutation probability, and that is valid <lb/>in populations of fixed size that are such that the reproductive values of all sites <lb/>are equal (i.e., when all individuals have the same fecundity, they all have the <lb/></body>

			<page>27 <lb/></page>

			<body>same chance of actually reproducing). The formula depends on the probability <lb/>of identity by descent of pairs of individuals, and we show how to compute those <lb/>in general. <lb/>Identity by descent and expected state of pairs of sites <lb/>The effects of social interactions depend on the actual types of the individuals <lb/>who interact. With imperfect strategy transmission from parents to their off-<lb/>spring (µ &gt; 0), common ancestry does not guarantee that two individuals are <lb/>of the same type. The concept of identity by descent, as we use it in this arti-<lb/>cle, adds to common ancestry the condition that no mutation has occured in <lb/>the two individuals&apos; lineages since the common ancestor (Kimura &amp; Crow, 1964; <lb/>Taylor et al., 2007b), and hence garanties that the two individuals are of the same <lb/>type. Two individuals that are not IBD can be treated independently, and we can <lb/>hence relate the probability that the individuals at two sites i and j to their ex-<lb/>pected state (eq. (11) and Allen &amp; Nowak (2014)). Finally, equations with proba-<lb/>bilities of identity by descent are much simpler than those for the expected state <lb/>of pairs of sites. <lb/>A structure parameter κ <lb/>Tarnita et al. (2009) and Taylor &amp; Maciejewski (2012) showed that, when so-<lb/>cial interactions affect fecundities, there exists a parameter independent of the <lb/>terms of the interaction matrix that summarizes the effects of population struc-<lb/>ture (in terms of dispersal patterns and also of who interacts with whom) and <lb/>depends on the rule chosen to update the population and on mutation; here we <lb/>provide a generic formula for such a structure parameter. This parameter, κ, can <lb/></body>

			<page>28 <lb/></page>

			<body>be interpreted as a scaled relatedness (Queller, 1994; Lehmann &amp; Rousset, 2010), <lb/>which includes the effect of competition. Eq. (13) provides a generic formula for <lb/>κ, for any life-cycle and population structure (provided condition eq. (1) is sat-<lb/>isfied). <lb/>The actual value of the scaled relatedness κ depends on the life-cycle and <lb/>on the mutation probability µ. First, κ includes competition (what we call &quot;in-<lb/>direct effects&quot;), and the scale of competition depends on the life-cycle (Grafen <lb/>&amp; Archetti, 2008; Débarre et al., 2014). Second, even direct effects-and so even <lb/>what is referred to as relatedness-do depend on the life-cycle and µ. <lb/>Finally, there is a single structure parameter κ because social interactions <lb/>only affect fecundity. Previous studies assuming vanishing or absent mutation <lb/>have shown that the parameter will be different if social interactions instead <lb/>influence survival (Nakamaru &amp; Iwasa, 2006; Taylor, 2010) and that we need <lb/>more than one parameter if social interactions affect both fecundity and sur-<lb/>vival (Débarre et al., 2014). <lb/>Updating rules and the evolution of altruism <lb/>We illustrate our results with specific updating rules, with either exactly new in-<lb/>dividual at each time step (Moran Birth-Death, Moran Death-Birth), or exactly <lb/>N new individuals, i.e., the entire population being renewed at each time step <lb/>(Wright-Fisher). Previous studies done under the assumption of vanishing mu-<lb/>tation rates (and with undirected transitive dispersal graphs) found that updat-<lb/>ing rules had a great impact on the evolution of altruism, and in particular, that <lb/>selection did not favor altruism (benefits given to others exclusively) under a <lb/>Wright-Fisher or Moran Birth-Death updating (the &quot;cancellation result&quot;; Taylor, <lb/></body>

			<page>29 <lb/></page>

			<body>1992; Taylor et al., 2011; Ohtsuki et al., 2007; Lehmann et al., 2007); the result <lb/>holds with imperfect strategy transmission as well. This is because the compe-<lb/>tition radius (individuals one dispersal step away [D] with a Moran Birth-Death <lb/>updating, individuals two dispersal steps away [D.D] with a Wright-Fisher up-<lb/>dating) matches the radius on which identities by descent are computed (see <lb/>eq. (17) and eq. (24)). On the other hand, under a Death-Birth updating, com-<lb/>petition is against individuals two dispersal steps away, but identity by descent <lb/>is computed using individuals one dispersal step away: competition is &quot;diluted&quot;, <lb/>and altruism can be favored by selection. Again, note that the conclusions for <lb/>the Moran model depend on which trait is affected by the social behavior: al-<lb/>truism is favored under a Birth-Death updating if survival, instead of fecundity, <lb/>is affected by social behavior (Nakamaru &amp; Iwasa, 2006; Taylor, 2010; Débarre <lb/>et al., 2014). <lb/>Implications for adaptive dynamics <lb/>Our results are obtained by considering the changes that occur during one time <lb/>step from a given population state, chosen from the stationary distribution of <lb/>population states-hence the phrase &quot;long-term&quot;, which differs from the use <lb/>made by, for instance Van Cleve (2015), where it refers to a trait substitution <lb/>sequence. Yet, our results can also be used in that context. The adaptive dy-<lb/>namics framework describes evolution as a series of trait substitutions (Geritz <lb/>et al., 1997; Champagnat et al., 2006; Champagnat &amp; Lambert, 2007; Lehmann, <lb/>2012; Lehmann &amp; Rousset, 2014) and is based on the assumption that mutations <lb/>are rare and incremental; in a finite population, trait evolution proceeds along <lb/>a gradient of fixation probabilities. Computing those fixations probabilities can <lb/></body>

			<body>be challenging in spatially structured populations. <lb/>Yet, the existence of a single parameter (in this case, defined as σ = (κ − <lb/>1)/(κ + 1), Tarnita et al., 2009) to characterize population structure and update <lb/>rules led to the extension of the adaptive dynamics framework to populations <lb/>with arbitrary structure (Allen et al., 2013), the structure parameter however re-<lb/>maining unspecified in general. Our formula for κ (eq. (13)) is valid for arbitrary <lb/>mutation, so a fortiori for vanishing mutation probabilities, and can therefore be <lb/>used to explicitly study adaptive dynamics in structured populations (provided <lb/>the reproductive values of all sites are equal). <lb/></body>
