Krimm * <lb/>Abstract <lb/>Background: During development, gustatory (taste) neurons likely undergo numerous changes in morphology and <lb/>expression prior to differentiation into maturity, but little is known this process or the factors that regulate it. Neuron <lb/>differentiation is likely regulated by a combination of transcription and growth factors. Embryonically, most geniculate <lb/>neuron development is regulated by the growth factor brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Postnatally, however, <lb/>BDNF expression becomes restricted to subpopulations of taste receptor cells with specific functions. We hypothesized <lb/>that during development, the receptor for BDNF, tropomyosin kinase B receptor (TrkB), may also become developmentally <lb/>restricted to a subset of taste neurons and could be one factor that is differentially expressed across taste neuron subsets. <lb/>Methods: We used transgenic mouse models to label both geniculate neurons innervating the oral cavity (Phox2b+), <lb/>which are primarily taste, from those projecting to the outer ear (auricular neurons) to label TrkB expressing neurons <lb/>(TrkB GFP ). We also compared neuron number, taste bud number, and taste receptor cell types in wild-type animals and <lb/>conditional TrkB knockouts. <lb/>Results: Between E15.5-E17.5, TrkB receptor expression becomes restricted to half of the Phox2b + neurons. This TrkB <lb/>downregulation was specific to oral cavity projecting neurons, since TrkB expression remained constant throughout <lb/>development in the auricular geniculate neurons (Phox2b-). Conditional TrkB removal from oral sensory neurons (Phox2b+) <lb/>reduced this population to 92% of control levels, indicating that only 8% of these neurons do not depend on TrkB for <lb/>survival during development. The remaining neurons failed to innervate any remaining taste buds, 14% of which remained <lb/>despite the complete loss of innervation. Finally, some types of taste receptor cells (Car4+) were more dependent on <lb/>innervation than others (PLCβ2+). <lb/>Conclusions: Together, these findings indicate that TrkB expression and dependence divides gustatory neurons into three <lb/>subpopulations: 1) neurons that always express TrkB and are TrkB-dependent during development (50%), 2) neurons <lb/>dependent on TrkB during development but that downregulate TrkB expression between E15.5 and E17.5 (41%), and 3) <lb/>neurons that never express or depend on TrkB (9%). These TrkB-independent neurons are likely non-gustatory, as they do <lb/>not innervate taste buds. <lb/>Keywords: BDNF, TrkB, Neurotrophin, Taste, Geniculate ganglion, Taste buds, Innervation, Neuron development, Gustatory <lb/>* Correspondence: rfkrim01@louisville.edu <lb/>Department of Anatomical Sciences and Neurobiology, University of <lb/>Louisville School of Medicine, 511 S.

			<body>Background <lb/>The geniculate ganglion primarily contains two neuron <lb/>subpopulations: 1) neurons that carry mostly taste, but <lb/>some somatosensory information from the anterior <lb/>two-thirds of the tongue and the palate to the brain (oral <lb/>sensory), and 2) those that innervate the outer ear through <lb/>the auricular nerve (auricular neurons). Development of <lb/>most of these neurons is regulated by the neurotrophin <lb/>brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF binds <lb/>with high affinity to the tropomyosin kinase B receptor <lb/>(TrkB) [1, 2] and critically regulates the survival of taste <lb/>neurons [3, 4]. Early in development, BDNF expression in <lb/>taste buds acts as a cue for TrkB+ fibers to innervate taste <lb/>organs [5-12]. Both this target innervation process and <lb/>neuron survival occur during a critical developmental <lb/>period [8, 10]. After this critical period, BDNF is downreg-<lb/>ulated in the taste bud, but continues to be expressed in a <lb/>subpopulation of taste receptor cells [13, 14]. This expres-<lb/>sion change suggests that BDNF may play a different role/ <lb/>s in later developmental stages and adulthood. <lb/>Most geniculate ganglion neurons express the BDNF <lb/>receptor TrkB [15-17] early in development and depend <lb/>on TrkB signaling for their survival [15, 18, 19]. How-<lb/>ever, in TrkB knockout animals, many innervated taste <lb/>buds remain at birth despite profound geniculate neuron <lb/>loss by E13.5 [15, 18]. One possible explanation is that <lb/>gustatory neurons lacking the TrkB receptor could mi-<lb/>grate into the geniculate ganglion after E13.5. Consist-<lb/>ently, in chick embryos, geniculate neurons continue to <lb/>delaminate from the epibranchial placodes and migrate <lb/>into the geniculate ganglion throughout embryonic de-<lb/>velopment [20]. How many gustatory neurons remain <lb/>after E13.5 in TrkB knockouts is unclear, particularly be-<lb/>cause earlier studies lacked markers for taste neurons <lb/>and did not quantify geniculate neurons after E13.5 [15, <lb/>18]. Therefore, a subset of TrkB-independent taste neu-<lb/>rons of unknown size likely exists. <lb/>By adulthood, only a subset of taste neurons appears <lb/>to be regulated by BDNF, as adult BDNF removal only <lb/>reduces taste bud innervation by 40% [21, 22]. There-<lb/>fore, in adulthood, many gustatory neurons likely lack <lb/>the TrkB receptor. Yet, it remains unknown if, when, or <lb/>how, during development or adulthood, TrkB expression <lb/>decreases in the neurons that innervate the oral cavity. <lb/>Here, our primary goals were to determine 1) how many <lb/>neurons express TrkB in adulthood, and 2) when and <lb/>how TrkB expression decreases during development. <lb/>Previous studies examining TrkB expression in adult-<lb/>hood lacked markers for distinguishing the roughly 50% <lb/>of geniculate ganglion neurons that are oral sensory <lb/>from the auricular neurons innervating the outer ear. <lb/>The transcription factor Phox2b was recently established <lb/>as a marker that distinguishes geniculate ganglion neu-<lb/>rons innervating the oral cavity (Phox2b+) from <lb/>auricular neurons (Phox2b-) [23, 24]. Using Phox2b as a <lb/>marker for geniculate oral sensory neurons, we deter-<lb/>mined that developmental reduction of TrkB-expression <lb/>and differential dependence on TrkB for survival divide <lb/>oral sensory neurons of the geniculate into three subsets. <lb/>These subpopulations were: 1) neurons that depend on <lb/>TrkB expression during development and continue to <lb/>express TrkB receptors in adulthood (50%), 2) neurons <lb/>that depend on TrkB during development but downreg-<lb/>ulate it between E15.5 and birth (41%), and 3) neurons <lb/>that never express or depend on TrkB and do not in-<lb/>nervate taste buds (9%). Therefore, adult roles of <lb/>TrkB-signaling are likely restricted to a subset of oral <lb/>cavity projecting neurons. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Animals <lb/>All mice were housed in a central facility and maintained <lb/>under controlled conditions of normal humidity and <lb/>temperature, with standard alternating 12-h periods of <lb/>light/dark and free access to water and food. Animals <lb/>were cared for and used in accordance with guidelines of <lb/>the U.S. Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care <lb/>and Use of Laboratory Animals and NIH Guide for the <lb/>Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. <lb/>To visualize TrkB expression in Phox2b-expressing neu-<lb/>rons, Phox2b-Cre (Tg [Phox2b-cre]NP91Gsat/Mmucd, <lb/>Stock No. 034613-UCD [23]) with tdTomato (Ai14, Jax <lb/>Stock No. 007914) mice were bred with TrkB GFP/+ <lb/>(B6.129S6[Cg]-Ntrk2 tm2.1Ddg /J, Jax Stock No. 023046) mice <lb/>[25, 26]. In Phox2b-Cre mice, gene recombination occurs <lb/>in any neuron that has ever expressed Phox2b. In the gen-<lb/>iculate ganglion, this is specific to oral sensory neurons <lb/>and excludes the somatosensory neurons that innervate <lb/>the outer ear via the auricular nerve [23]. These oral sen-<lb/>sory neurons are mostly gustatory, but also include som-<lb/>atosensory fibers [24, 27-29]. However, most of the <lb/>somatosensory neurons innervating the tongue arise from <lb/>the trigeminal ganglion. In TrkB GFP/+ mice, GFP had been <lb/>shown to be expressed in the same geniculate neurons <lb/>that labeled with an anti-TrkB antibody ([27], supplemen-<lb/>tary Fig. 3), making it an appropriate marker for <lb/>TrkB-expressing neurons. <lb/>Embryo heads from mice aged E13.5 (n = 2), E15.5 (n = <lb/>3), E17.5 (n = 4), and P0 (n = 3) were collected for immuno-<lb/>histochemistry. The day that a vaginal plug was observed <lb/>was designated E0.5. Geniculate ganglia from adult mice <lb/>(P60) were also collected for whole mount and serial sec-<lb/>tions. To conditionally remove the TrkB receptor from oral <lb/>cavity neurons, we bred Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ <lb/>mice with a mouse line in which the coding region of the <lb/>TrkB gene was surrounded by loxP sites (Ntrk2 tm1Ddg /J <lb/>mouse, Jax Stock No. 022363) [30]. These conditional TrkB <lb/>knockout mice do not live to adulthood and instead die at <lb/></body>

			<body>different postnatal ages [15, 31], so we collected geniculate <lb/>ganglia and tongues from Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/ <lb/>loxP (n = 8) and Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ (n = 5) <lb/>P20. These geniculate ganglia were processed to determine <lb/>how many oral sensory neurons depended on TrkB signal-<lb/>ing during development. <lb/>Immunohistochemistry <lb/>Embryos aged E13.5 were fixed by immersion in 4% <lb/>paraformaldehyde (PFA). Embryos aged E15.5 and older, <lb/>young (P20) mice, and adult (P60) mice were all sacri-<lb/>ficed with an overdose (1 ml, i.p.) of 2.5% tribromoetha-<lb/>nol (Avertin) and then were trans-cardially perfused <lb/>with 4% PFA. Geniculate ganglia were dissected under a <lb/>microscope and then embryo and newborn heads or <lb/>geniculate ganglia from adult mice were post-fixed in 4% <lb/>PFA overnight at 4 °C. Tissue was then transferred to <lb/>30% sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for cryo-<lb/>protection at 4 °C overnight. The following day, tissue <lb/>was frozen on dry ice in OCT (Sakura Tek) embedding <lb/>medium and stored at − 80 °C until processed for <lb/>immunohistochemistry. <lb/>To visualize oral cavity neurons in adult mice, entire gen-<lb/>iculate ganglia were rinsed in 0.1 M PB four times and <lb/>blocked overnight with 3% donkey serum in 0.1 M PBS <lb/>containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBST). Ganglia were then <lb/>incubated with the following primary antibodies for 5 d at <lb/>4 °C: goat anti-GFP (1:400; Novus, AB Registry ID: <lb/>AB_10128178, Cat No. NB100-1700, Littleton, CO) and <lb/>rabbit polyclonal anti-dsRed (1:500, Clontech Laboratories, <lb/>Inc., Cat No. 632496, Mountain View, CA) and for some <lb/>ganglia anti-calbindin (1:1000; Neuromics, Edina, MD). <lb/>After incubation in primary antibodies and four rinses with <lb/>0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), tissues were incubated for 2 d <lb/>in the following secondary antibodies: anti-goat Alexa Fluor <lb/>488 (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West <lb/>Grove, PA) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500; Jackson <lb/>ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and for some ganglia <lb/>anti-chicken Alexa 647 (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch <lb/>Laboratories). The tissue was then washed four times in <lb/>0.1 M PB, mounted onto slides, and cover-slipped using <lb/>aqueous mounting medium (Fluoromount-G, SouthernBio-<lb/>tech, Birmingham, AL). <lb/>Alternatively, serial transverse sections (20 μm) were cut <lb/>using a cryostat. Sections were left to air-dry on a slide <lb/>warmer overnight. The next day, sections were post-fixed <lb/>in 4% PFA for 15 min at 4 °C. After four rinses with PBST, <lb/>sections were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with <lb/>5% normal goat serum in PBST. Then, the tissue was in-<lb/>cubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary anti-<lb/>bodies: chicken anti-GFP (1:1000; Thermo Fisher, Cat No. <lb/>A10262, Carlsbad, CA) and rabbit anti-P2X3 (1:500; Milli-<lb/>pore, AB Registry ID: AB_11212062, Cat No. AB58950, <lb/>Billerica, MA). After incubation in primary antibodies and <lb/>four rinses in PBST, sections were incubated for 1 h at <lb/>room temperature in the following secondary antibodies: <lb/>goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500; Jackson Immu-<lb/>noResearch Laboratories) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor <lb/>647 (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The <lb/>tissue was then washed four times in 0.1 M PBS, mounted <lb/>onto slides, and cover-slipped using aqueous mounting <lb/>medium (Fluoromount-G). <lb/>To visualize fungiform papillae and innervated taste buds, <lb/>anterior tongue-halves from Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::Trk <lb/>B GFP/loxP and Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ mice were <lb/>collected at P20 using the same procedures as described for <lb/>geniculate ganglia. To examine taste bud innervation and <lb/>Car4-positive taste receptor cells, thick sagittal sections <lb/>(70 μm) of one half tongue from each animal were cut <lb/>using a cryostat and rinsed in 0.1 M PB four times for 15 <lb/>min. After blocking with 3% normal donkey serum in 0.1 <lb/>M PB containing 0.5% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C, tis-<lb/>sues were incubated for 5 d in the following primary anti-<lb/>bodies: rat anti-cytokeratin-8 (K8, 1:50, Cat No. Troma-1-s, <lb/>Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), <lb/>rabbit polyclonal anti-dsRed (1:500, Clontech Laboratories, <lb/>Inc., Cat No. 632496), and either goat anti-Car4 (1:500, Cat <lb/>No. AF2414, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Floating <lb/>sections were rinsed in 0.1 M PB four times for 15 min and <lb/>incubated for 2 d in the following secondary antibodies <lb/>(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories): donkey anti-rat <lb/>Alexa Fluor 488, donkey anti-rabbit Cy3, and donkey <lb/>anti-goat Alexa 647. To examine taste bud innervation and <lb/>PLCβ2-positive taste receptor cells, the other half of the <lb/>tongue for each animal was incubated for 5 d in rabbit <lb/>anti-PLCβ2 (1:500, Cat No. SC-206, Santa Cruz Biotechnol-<lb/>ogy, Dallas, TX). Floating sections were rinsed in 0.1 M PB <lb/>four times for 15 min and incubated for 2 d in donkey <lb/>anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647. Then, sections were rinsed in <lb/>0.1 M PB four times for 15 min and blocked for 2 d with <lb/>donkey anti-rabbit (1:100, Cat No. 007-003-007, Jackson <lb/>ImmunoResearch, Laboratories). After four rinses in 0.1 M <lb/>PB for 15 min, sections were incubated for 5 d in the fol-<lb/>lowing primary antibodies: rat anti-K8 (1:50, Cat No. <lb/>Troma-1-s, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa <lb/>City, IA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-dsRed (1:500, Clontech <lb/>Laboratories, Inc., Cat No. 632496).

			<body>Neuron quantification of whole mounts at P20 and in <lb/>adulthood <lb/>Images of whole ganglia were captured using a 40× oil <lb/>immersion lens (FV1200, Olympus) with a step size of <lb/>0.47 μm. Confocal images were obtained by stitching <lb/>multiple fields to create a high-resolution image of the <lb/>entire ganglia in a single Z-stack. Each labeled channel <lb/>was collected individually using single-wavelength exci-<lb/>tation. Images of each optical section through the whole <lb/>ganglia were then analyzed using Neurolucida 360 (MBF <lb/>Bioscience, Williston, VT). Brightness and contrast were <lb/>adjusted for background standardization in all images. <lb/>Each labeled neuron was followed through the optical <lb/>sections so that each neuron was only counted once. <lb/>The absolute number of single-(anti-dsRed) and <lb/>double-labeled (anti-dsRed and anti-GFP) neurons were <lb/>counted by examining each cell through the Z-stack. <lb/>Neuron size was measured by measuring the area of the <lb/>neurons from the optical section where the neuron ap-<lb/>pears to be its largest size; diameters were then calcu-<lb/>lated from areas. <lb/>Neuron quantification of sections during development <lb/>Serial sections of embedded embryo and newborn heads <lb/>and adult geniculate ganglia were captured using a 40× <lb/>oil immersion lens (FV1200, Olympus). Confocal images <lb/>were collected using single-wavelength excitation taken <lb/>with a step size of 1.0 μm. Alternating images from serial <lb/>sections containing ganglia were then analyzed using <lb/>Neurolucida 360 (MBF Bioscience). The number of sin-<lb/>gle-(anti-dsRed) and double-labeled (anti-dsRed and <lb/>anti-GFP) neurons were counted in alternating sections <lb/>by following each cell through the Z-stack so that each <lb/>neuron was only counted once. The percentage of oral <lb/>cavity neurons (tdTomato+) expressing TrkB (GFP+) <lb/>was calculated for each section and averaged for each <lb/>animal per age group and then compared to tdTomato <lb/>single-positive neurons. To quantify TrkB expression in <lb/>non-taste neurons, the percentage of neurons that <lb/>expressed both TrkB (GFP) and P2X3 but not Phox2b <lb/>was examined across ages. <lb/>Quantification of fungiform papillae and taste bud <lb/>number after conditional removal of TrkB from oral <lb/>sensory neurons <lb/>Images of taste buds were captured from thick sections <lb/>of tongue-halves using a 60× oil immersion lens with a <lb/>step size of 1.0 μm. Images were collected using <lb/>single-wavelength excitation and projected along the <lb/>Z-axis. To determine how TrkB removal affected taste <lb/>bud number, we counted taste buds in fungiform papil-<lb/>lae using DAPI staining with a fluorescence microscope <lb/>and a 20× objective lens. We examined all sections for <lb/>one-half of a mouse tongue. Anti-K8 labeling indicated <lb/>the presence of a taste bud in each fungiform papilla. <lb/>We examined all the taste buds labeled with anti-K8 on <lb/>each half tongue and quantified the number of taste <lb/>buds containing Car4+ or PLCβ2+ labeled cells. The <lb/>percentage of taste buds containing Car4+ and PLCβ2+ <lb/>taste receptor cells was calculated by dividing the num-<lb/>ber of taste buds containing labeled cells by the total <lb/>number of taste buds for each one-half of tongue <lb/>(anti-K8, n = 3/genotype). <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>A student&apos;s t-test was used to compare the number of <lb/>double-labeled vs. single-labeled neurons in Phox2b-<lb/>Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/lox mice in adulthood (n = 3). A <lb/>Chi-squared (X 2 ) test was used to analyze the percentage of <lb/>Phox2b neurons that express TrkB in geniculate ganglion <lb/>sections in E15.5 (n = 3), compared to E17.5 (n = 4), P0 (n <lb/>= 3) and adult (n = 3). Because this is 3 statistical tests, type <lb/>one error was controlled using a Bonferroni correction, and <lb/>so a p-value of p &lt; 0.0167 was established before analysis. A <lb/>Chi-squared (χ 2 ) test was also used to analyze TrkB expres-<lb/>sion in Phox2b-negative neurons across different ages <lb/>(E13.5 (n = 2), P0 (n = 3), and adult (n = 3)) and Bonferroni <lb/>correction was used for a p-value of p &lt; 0.025. A students <lb/>t-test was used to compare the number of remaining <lb/>neurons at P20 in conditional TrkB knockouts (Phox2b--<lb/>Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/lox , n = 8) compared with controls <lb/>(Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ , controls, n = 5). A <lb/>student&apos;s t-test was used to compare the number of taste <lb/>buds between controls (Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ , <lb/>n = 5) and conditional knockouts (Phox2b-Cre::tdToma-<lb/>to::TrkB GFP/lox n = 5). Chi-squared (χ 2 ) test was used to <lb/>compare the percentage of taste buds with PLCβ2+ and <lb/>Car4+ cells between (Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/lox , <lb/>conditional knockouts, n = 3) and controls (Phox2b-Cre::td-<lb/>Tomato::TrkB GFP/+ , controls, n=3).

			<body>Trigeminal neurons innervating the tongue are also <lb/>Phox2b-. Thus, in the geniculate ganglion, Phox2b expres-<lb/>sion is fairly specific to taste neurons, plus a few general <lb/>oral sensory neurons. To visualize TrkB expression in oral <lb/>sensory neurons, we crossed Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato mice <lb/>with TrkB GFP/+ mice to visualize TrkB receptor expression <lb/>(GFP+: green) in oral sensory neurons (dsRed+, red; <lb/>Fig. 1a). We quantified neurons from Z-stacks of adult <lb/>(P60) whole mount geniculate ganglia. In adulthood, not <lb/>all geniculate ganglion neurons expressed the TrkB recep-<lb/>tor (Fig. 1a, b). Specifically, while GFP labeling was distrib-<lb/>uted throughout the ganglion, tdTomato+ neurons were <lb/>located more medially and closer to the greater superficial <lb/>petrosal nerve (Fig. 1a). This suggests that oral <lb/>cavity-projecting neurons are primarily localized to one <lb/>part of the ganglion. <lb/>We then quantified the numbers of single-labeled (TrkB-, <lb/>tdTomato only) and double-labeled (TrkB+, red and green) <lb/>oral cavity-projecting neurons in whole mount P60 genicu-<lb/>late ganglia (Fig. 1b). An average of 354 ± 33 neurons were <lb/>Phox2b+. Of those, 185 ± 21 neurons co-labeled with GFP, <lb/>while 169 ± 0 neurons expressed tdTomato alone (**p &lt; <lb/>0.01; Fig. 1b). Thus, roughly 52% of oral cavity-projecting <lb/>neurons express TrkB in adulthood. Although different in <lb/>terms of TrkB expression these two populations were not <lb/>different in terms of diameter (Phox2b-only (17.8 ± 0.2) vs <lb/>Phox2b/TrkB (17.7 ± 0.2), p = 0.21). <lb/>TrkB expression declines between E15.5 and E17.5 <lb/>Although approximately half of oral cavity-projecting neu-<lb/>rons express TrkB in adulthood (Fig. 1), approximately 90% <lb/>of geniculate neurons express TrkB between E11.5 and <lb/>E13.5 [15-17, 32]. We next sought to determine at what <lb/>period during development TrkB expression decreases. <lb/>Using Phox2b-tdTomato to identify oral cavity-projecting <lb/>neurons, we quantified the number of tdTomato+ neurons <lb/>expressing TrkB-GFP at ages E13.5, E15.5, E17.5, at birth <lb/>(P0), and adulthood (P60) from serial transverse sections <lb/>using immunohistochemistry. Consistent with previous <lb/>findings [15, 17], we observed TrkB GFP labeling throughout <lb/>most of the geniculate ganglion at E13.5. TrkB GFP labeling <lb/>was also observed outside of the geniculate ganglion (Top <lb/>panel, Fig. 2a-e). Across all ages examined, Phox2b-tdTo-<lb/>mato labeling (red) was more prevalent in the medial por-<lb/>tion of the geniculate ganglion (Middle panel, Fig. 2a-e). At <lb/>E13.5 and E15.5, TrkB GFP labeling appeared uniformly dis-<lb/>tributed throughout the geniculate ganglion. After E17.5, <lb/>TrkB labeling appeared to be more strongly expressed <lb/>tdTomato-(non-taste) neurons, and this pattern persisted <lb/>through adulthood (bottom panel, Fig. 2a-e). <lb/>Understanding the temporal dynamics of TrkB ex-<lb/>pression might provide insight into the mechanism <lb/>underlying decreased TrkB expression in adulthood. <lb/>To determine when during development TrkB expres-<lb/>sion begins to decrease in oral sensory neurons, the <lb/>Fig. 1 Half of adult taste neurons express the TrkB receptor. a) Representative image of the entire z-stack of a whole mount adult geniculate <lb/>ganglion from a Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ mouse labeled for both tdTomato (oral cavity-projecting, red) and GFP (TrkB, green). b) <lb/>Quantification of the total number of neurons (n = 3) projecting to the oral cavity (red only) and oral cavity-projecting neurons that express <lb/>TrkB GFP (double-labeled). c-e) Magnified images of a single optical section illustrate the criteria used to identify and count single-labeled <lb/>(arrowhead) and double-labeled (arrow) oral cavity-projecting neurons.

How-<lb/>ever, by E17.7, TrkB expression was significantly <lb/>reduced to only 63% (***p &lt; 0.001) and remained re-<lb/>duced at birth (57%; ***p &lt; 0.001). By adulthood, only <lb/>50% of tdTomato+ neurons expressed GFP. These <lb/>data replicate our findings regarding TrkB expression <lb/>in whole mount ganglia (Fig. 1). Thus, TrkB expres-<lb/>sion is significantly reduced to approximately 50% of <lb/>oral cavity-projecting neurons between E15.5 and <lb/>E17.5 and remains reduced into adulthood. <lb/>Decreased TrkB expression is specific to Phox2b + oral <lb/>sensory neurons <lb/>Because TrkB expression is reduced in tdTomato+ neu-<lb/>rons, we next wanted to determine if this decrease was <lb/>specific to oral sensory neurons, or if it also occurred in <lb/>the auricular neurons of the geniculate ganglion. To de-<lb/>termine if TrkB expression was also reduced in these <lb/>auricular neurons during development, we examined <lb/>TrkB expression in tdTomato-neurons. We used P2X3 <lb/>(Fig. 3: blue) as a general marker of geniculate ganglion <lb/>neurons [15, 33, 34]. Contrary to previous reports [33], <lb/>P2X3 did not label all tdTomato-neurons (Fig. 3). P2X3 <lb/>labeling was observed in many sensory neurons within <lb/>the geniculate ganglion, including some Phox2b-cells. <lb/>TrkB GFP labeling was brighter in some regions of the <lb/>geniculate ganglion, especially near Phox2b-neurons. <lb/>This pattern continued into birth and adulthood.

Importantly, the percentage of P2X3+/tdTo-<lb/>mato-neurons expressing TrkB did not significantly differ <lb/>at birth (86.4%; p &gt; 0.05) or adulthood (94.7%; p &gt; 0.05). <lb/>Thus, in somatosensory (non-taste) geniculate ganglion <lb/>neurons, TrkB receptor expression remains consistent <lb/>across development. We conclude that decreased TrkB <lb/>expression during development is specific to a subset of <lb/>neurons that carry oral sensory (primarily taste) informa-<lb/>tion from the tongue and soft palate to the brain. TrkB re-<lb/>duction is likely part of the differentiation program for <lb/>this specific subset of taste neurons. <lb/>A small population of Phox2b + oral sensory neurons is <lb/>TrkB-independent during development <lb/>When TrkB expression is eliminated during development, <lb/>most geniculate ganglion neurons (94%) are lost by E13.5. <lb/>However, 33% of the taste buds remain and most of these <lb/>are innervated at birth [15], which seemed a surprising <lb/>amount of innervation considering the large total genicu-<lb/>late neuron loss. Because neurons continue to migrate <lb/>into the geniculate ganglion over a long period of <lb/>embryonic development [20], we speculated that at least <lb/>some of the decreased TrkB+ expression observed at <lb/>E17.5 resulted from the migration of TrkB-neurons into <lb/>the geniculate ganglion after E15.5. If this were the case, <lb/>these TrkB+ tdTomato+ neurons would be present in the <lb/>geniculate ganglion at later stages of development when <lb/>TrkB is conditionally removed. Alternatively, TrkB expres-<lb/>sion may be downregulated after the critical developmen-<lb/>tal period for either geniculate neuron targeting or <lb/>survival [8, 10, 21, 35]. In this case, most geniculate neu-<lb/>rons would be lost in conditional TrkB knockouts. To <lb/>evaluate these possibilities, we quantified the number of <lb/>tdTomato+ neurons remaining in the geniculate ganglion <lb/>at P20 in conditional TrkB knockout mice (Phox2b--<lb/>Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/loxP ) compared to controls <lb/>(Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ ). <lb/>As shown in adulthood (Fig. 1), TrkB expression was <lb/>not homogenous across the geniculate ganglion at P20 <lb/>(Fig. 4a, green). tdTomato expression was restricted to a <lb/>subset of neurons, confirming that not all geniculate <lb/>ganglion neurons express Phox2b (Fig. 4a, red). The gen-<lb/>iculate ganglia from Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato:: TrkB GFP/ <lb/>loxP mice were smaller and contained fewer tdTomato+ <lb/>neurons relative to controls.

Of the 156 remaining <lb/>Phox2b neurons in mice where GFP was quantifiable (n = <lb/>7) only one also appeared to be labeled with GFP (fewer <lb/>than 1%). Therefore, the TrkB-independent population <lb/>does not express either the full-length or the truncated <lb/>TrkB receptor.

This proportion is equivalent to the percentage of <lb/>tdTomato+/TrkB-neurons in the geniculate ganglion at <lb/>E13.5 (5%). Therefore, new TrkB-independent taste neu-<lb/>rons do not migrate into the geniculate ganglion after <lb/>E13.5. These results support the conclusion that 92% of <lb/>taste neurons express and depend on TrkB during devel-<lb/>opment (E13.5 and earlier), and that TrkB is downregu-<lb/>lated in a subset of these neurons between E15.5 and <lb/>E17.5. <lb/>A recent study defined three subpopulations of gustatory <lb/>neurons based on expression [24].

Consistent with a previous report [24], some of the <lb/>Phox2b-negative neurons showed weak calbindin expres-<lb/>sion (Fig. 4d, bottom). Therefore, this small population of <lb/>calbindin-positive oral cavity projecting neurons is a subset <lb/>of the neurons that are TrkB-dependent during develop-<lb/>ment, but lose their TrkB expression by adulthood. <lb/>Remaining neurons innervate fungiform papillae but not <lb/>taste buds, resulting in a substantial taste bud loss by P20 <lb/>A small group of Phox2b + geniculate neurons do not de-<lb/>pend on the TrkB receptor during development. These oral <lb/>sensory neurons are primarily gustatory, but also include a <lb/>small population of somatosensory neurons [24, 36]. <lb/>Therefore, whether the remaining neurons in conditional <lb/>TrkB knockouts innervated taste buds was unclear. To <lb/>examine the location of innervation for these remaining <lb/>oral sensory neurons, we examined the entire tongue for <lb/>dsRed positive nerve fibers in control (Phox2b-Cre::tdTo-<lb/>mato::TrkB GFP/+ ; Fig. 5a) and conditional TrkB knockout <lb/>(Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/loxP ; Fig. 5b, c) mice. <lb/>Conditional TrkB removal reduced taste bud size and com-<lb/>pletely eliminated tdTomato innervation within taste buds <lb/>(Fig. 5b). We found only a few tdTomato+ fibers innervat-<lb/>ing the lingual epithelium. These fibers innervated fungi-<lb/>form papillae, but these papillae lacked taste buds (Fig. 5c). <lb/>The few neurons remaining following TrkB removal might <lb/>belong to a somatosensory neuron population, since they <lb/>innervated fungiform epithelium and not taste buds. <lb/>TrkB is required for the survival of 92% of oral sensory <lb/>neurons in the geniculate ganglion; gustatory neurons <lb/>are required to maintain taste buds [37-40]. So, next we <lb/>quantified the number of taste buds that developed in <lb/>the absence of TrkB fibers. Consistent with previous <lb/>findings, TrkB removal significantly reduced the number <lb/>of taste buds (Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ : 63.8 ± <lb/>4.9 vs. Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/loxP : 8.9 ± 1.5, <lb/>**p &lt; 0.01, Fig. 5d).

			<body>Because the remaining taste buds completely lacked in-<lb/>nervation, we also wanted to determine if nerve fibers pref-<lb/>erentially supported specific subtypes of taste receptor cells. <lb/>Taste buds from Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ (Fig. 5a, <lb/>e-g) and Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/loxP (Fig. 5b, h-j) <lb/>mice were labeled for PLCβ2, a marker for Type II taste re-<lb/>ceptor cells that transduce bitter, sweet, umami [41], and <lb/>for Car4, a marker of Type III cells that transduce sour <lb/>[42]. We quantified the percentages of taste buds with <lb/>PLCβ2+ and Car4+ cells for both genotypes. All taste buds <lb/>from Phox2b-Cre::tdTomato::TrkB GFP/+ mice contained <lb/>both Car4+ and PLCβ2+ taste receptor cells (Fig. 5f and g). <lb/>In contrast, taste buds from conditional knockouts typically <lb/>lacked Car4+ cells (Fig. 5i and j), while PLCβ2+ cells were <lb/>present in 100% of taste buds examined from both geno-<lb/>types (Fig. 5k). Conditional TrkB knockout mice had sig-<lb/>nificantly fewer Car4+ cells in the remaining taste buds to <lb/>~21.3 ± 2.5% compared to controls (Phox2b-Cre::tdToma-<lb/>to::TrkB GFP/+ : 85.3 ± 1.8%, **p &lt; 0.01, Fig. 5k). These data <lb/>suggest that the loss of innervation caused by TrkB removal <lb/>markedly reduces the number of taste buds and Type III <lb/>taste receptor cells by P20. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>During development, the neurotrophin BDNF and its re-<lb/>ceptor TrkB play vital roles in the development of gen-<lb/>iculate ganglion neurons [8, 43]. Specifically, BDNF and <lb/>NT4 regulate apoptotic developmental cell death and <lb/>targeting via TrkB [3, 8, 15, 44, 45]. Most geniculate <lb/>neurons express TrkB in early development (E13.5 [15, <lb/>17]). By adulthood, however, the ligand for TrkB, BDNF, <lb/>is expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells, and <lb/>BDNF removal reduces some but not all of the nerve fi-<lb/>bers innervating taste buds [21, 22]. These findings sug-<lb/>gest that by adulthood, TrkB expression may be limited <lb/>to a subset of taste neurons and BDNF-TrkB signaling <lb/>functions to maintain innervation of this subset, but not <lb/>others [21, 22]. Consistent with these findings, we found <lb/>that not all adult Phox2b + (taste) neurons expressed <lb/>TrkB. Furthermore, TrkB expression decreased in these <lb/>neurons between E15.5 and E17.5 such that it was <lb/>expressed in half the taste neurons by adulthood. This <lb/>reduction likely signifies a changing role for TrkB during <lb/>development. <lb/>There were two potential explanations for how this de-<lb/>velopmental reduction in TrkB expression occurred. <lb/>One possibility was that TrkB receptors were downregu-<lb/>lated and became restricted to a subset of geniculate <lb/>neurons. Alternatively, TrkB expression could have de-<lb/>creased because TrkB-neurons migrate into the genicu-<lb/>late ganglion after E13.5 [20], an age when most <lb/>geniculate neurons both express and depend on TrkB <lb/>[15]. We found that TrkB-neurons do not migrate into <lb/>the geniculate ganglion at later embryonic ages, and <lb/>instead the TrkB receptor is downregulated. Specifically, <lb/>TrkB expression did not decrease until after E15.5, <lb/>which is later than might be expected if new TrkB-ex-<lb/>pressing neurons continue to migrate into the geniculate <lb/>ganglion. Furthermore, the small number of TrkB-ex-<lb/>pressing oral cavity neurons present in the E13.5 genicu-<lb/>late ganglion (approximate 5%) accounted for most of <lb/>the remaining neurons in the conditional TrkB knockout <lb/>at P20 (approximately 9%). We conclude that most <lb/>(91%) of the oral cavity neurons initially express and <lb/>depend on the TrkB receptor and then 41% of these <lb/>neurons downregulate TrkB between E15.5 and E17.5. <lb/>The timing of TrkB downregulation in the oral <lb/>cavity-projecting neurons corresponds with the timing of <lb/>decreased BDNF expression in the taste bud [32]. Around <lb/>E14.5, geniculate neurons depend on BDNF expression in <lb/>the lingual epithelium to properly innervate their targets <lb/>[8, 11]. By E15.5, geniculate neurons have already reached <lb/>their targets, so BDNF should no longer be needed in the <lb/>tongue at such high levels. Also, at these later stages, gen-<lb/>iculate neurons no longer depend on BDNF for survival <lb/>[10]. Thus, the timing of decreased TrkB expression cor-<lb/>responds with changing roles of BDNF-TrkB signaling <lb/>during development. Another example in these same neu-<lb/>rons of a developmentally critical gene changing roles dur-<lb/>ing development, is the growth factor receptor, Ret (27). <lb/>Ret regulates expression of the transcription factor, <lb/>Phox2b, embryonically, but later identifies a subset of <lb/>adult Ret expressing neurons that are likely somatosensory <lb/>in function [27]. The role of TrkB in adulthood may be to <lb/>regulate plasticity and branching characteristics for a sub-<lb/>set of oral sensory geniculate neurons (TrkB-expressing <lb/>[22]), but could also regulate taste function in this same <lb/>neuron subset [14]. <lb/>In the dorsal root ganglion, a series of developmentally <lb/>expressed transcription factors and growth factor recep-<lb/>tors orchestrate neuron subtype development [46]. How-<lb/>ever, our current understanding of neuron subtypes and <lb/>how they differentiate within the geniculate ganglion is <lb/>still emergent. The transcription factor Phox2b plays a <lb/>role in the differentiation of neurons that control <lb/>viscero-sensory functions [47-49] and so likely specifies <lb/>oral sensory from auricular neurons in the geniculate gan-<lb/>glion [23, 24]. We found that the TrkB expression is <lb/>downregulated specifically in this subset of geniculate <lb/>neurons (Phox2b + oral sensory neurons), but not in the <lb/>auricular neurons. A finding consistent with a higher level <lb/>of TrkB expression in auricular neurons than oral sensory <lb/>neurons by adulthood [24]. Therefore, Phox2b-regulated <lb/>differentiation into an oral sensory neuron subtype is <lb/>likely required for this decrease in TrkB expression. How-<lb/>ever, this decrease only occurs in half of the Phox2b + <lb/>neurons. Given that Phox2b expression first occurs at E9-<lb/>9.5 [49, 50], which is days before the downregulation of <lb/></body>

			<body>TrkB, Phox2b likely initiates a cascade of events orches-<lb/>trating the differentiation of taste neurons followed by <lb/>differentiation of neuron subtypes. A complex series of <lb/>events such that combinations of these factors work <lb/>together to orchestrate adult expression patterns (24) <lb/>seems likely. For example, the growth factor receptor, Ret, <lb/>is expressed in both TrkB+ and TrkB-neurons, which fur-<lb/>ther divides oral sensory neurons into Ret+TrkB+,Ret <lb/>+TrkB-,Ret-TrkB+, etc. [27]. Using a combination of fac-<lb/>tors to specify neuron subtypes permits a smaller number <lb/>of factors to orchestrate the development of a larger num-<lb/>ber of neuron subtypes (i.e. two factors can specify four <lb/>types, etc). It is now clear that multiple molecular <lb/>subtypes of oral sensory neurons are present in the <lb/>geniculate ganglion [24], although precisely how many is <lb/>still unclear. <lb/>Interestingly, a recently defined subpopulation of taste <lb/>neurons that express calbindin [24], are a subset of the <lb/>neurons that depend on TrkB during development but <lb/>lose TrkB-expression by adulthood. This finding is con-<lb/>sistent with the idea that adult TrkB+ and TrkB-neu-<lb/>rons are too large to be a single pure neuronal subset. <lb/>However, it is also consistent with the idea that pure <lb/>neuronal subsets do not contain both TrkB+ and TrkB-<lb/>neurons in adulthood. Instead, the calbindin+ subpopu-<lb/>lation is one of multiple gustatory neuron subpopula-<lb/>tions whose adult innervation patterns are not likely to <lb/>be regulated by BDNF [21, 22]. <lb/>While much of gustatory neuron differentiation may be <lb/>regulated by a cascade of intrinsically expressed molecular <lb/>factors, the target also likely regulates gustatory neuron dif-<lb/>ferentiation. Once taste neurons innervate their targets <lb/>BDNF from the taste bud could maintain TrkB expression <lb/>in gustatory neurons, such that those innervating BDNF-<lb/>expressing taste receptor cells retain the higher TrkB levels. <lb/>Because BDNF is preferentially expressed in the taste <lb/>receptor cells that express the neurotransmitter serotonin <lb/>[14], TrkB might be preferentially expressed in neurons that <lb/>have the serotonin receptor, Htr3a, which mediates the <lb/>neuronal serotonin response [51]. Consistently, mean TrkB <lb/>expression is higher in the Phox2b + neurons that express <lb/>Htr3a relative to those that do not [24]. <lb/>When TrkB was conditionally removed from Phox2b <lb/>+ neurons during early development, a few remaining <lb/>neurons innervated the oral cavity. This is consistent <lb/>with studies using full TrkB knockouts reporting that <lb/>TrkB removal substantially reduces the number of gen-<lb/>iculate ganglion neurons [15, 18]. However, these previ-<lb/>ous studies could not examine innervation patterns of <lb/>these remaining neurons, as they lacked appropriate <lb/>genetic markers. Here, we found a few tdTomato+ fibers <lb/>innervating the epithelium in a fungiform papilla and no <lb/>labeled innervation in remaining taste buds. There are <lb/>several possible sources of these remaining fibers. These <lb/>few remaining nerve fibers might have originally inner-<lb/>vated locations previously occupied by a taste bud and <lb/>remain when taste buds are lost. Alternatively, these <lb/>remaining neurons may be non-taste, and could belong <lb/>instead to a small somatosensory population in the gen-<lb/>iculate ganglion that innervate the oral cavity [27, 36, <lb/>52]. We found this neuron population to be surprisingly <lb/>small (only 4 neurons in some individuals); therefore, it <lb/>may not be a large enough population to have been <lb/>identified in recent expression studies [24]. <lb/>Consistent with the neuronal loss, conditional TrkB <lb/>knockout mouse tongues had fewer taste buds. Previous <lb/>reports of full TrkB knockouts indicate that 37% of the <lb/>taste buds remained [15], compared to only 14% in the <lb/>current study. Furthermore, in one of these earlier stud-<lb/>ies, 58% of the remaining taste buds were innervated in <lb/>full TrkB knockout mice [15], while we observed no <lb/>remaining taste bud innervation. One explanation for <lb/>these discrepancies is that P2X3 was previously used as <lb/>marker for taste bud innervation [15]. P2X3 is expressed <lb/>in some somatosensory neurons [53]; therefore, <lb/>non-taste P2X3+ fibers may innervate some of the <lb/>remaining taste buds. More likely, these two studies ex-<lb/>amined different postnatal ages; therefore, the remaining <lb/>Phox2b + neurons in the geniculate ganglion might ini-<lb/>tially innervate taste buds at birth but retract by P20, <lb/>resulting in an additional postnatal taste bud loss. <lb/>Taste buds require innervation to retain their normal <lb/>size and integrity [40, 54, 55]. Because some taste buds <lb/>remained despite complete innervation loss by P20, we in-<lb/>vestigated whether developmental denervation influences <lb/>some taste cell types more than others. We found that <lb/>Car4+ taste receptor cells, known to express SNAP25 and <lb/>have synapses [56, 57], were absent from most remaining <lb/>taste buds. Alternatively, all remaining taste buds still con-<lb/>tained PLCβ2+ taste receptor cells. Therefore, Car4+ taste <lb/>receptor cells may depend on innervation more than <lb/>PLCβ2+ receptor cells. Innervation likely supports taste <lb/>buds at least in part by releasing sonic hedgehog [58, 59]. <lb/>However, in the absence of innervation, the few remaining <lb/>taste buds could be supported by epithelial-derived sonic <lb/>hedgehog [28, 58, 60-62]. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Taken together, these data show that TrkB expression <lb/>and dependence divides taste neurons into subpopula-<lb/>tions. We suggest that BDNF expression initially guides <lb/>TrkB+ fibers to innervate taste buds during a critical de-<lb/>velopmental period [8]. During this time, all taste neu-<lb/>rons express and depend on TrkB, while the 9% of oral <lb/>cavity-projecting neurons that are TrkB-independent are <lb/>oral somatosensory. After this critical period, TrkB ex-<lb/>pression in Phox2b + neurons is downregulated, dividing <lb/>these neurons into a TrkB+ and TrkB-subpopulations. <lb/></body>
