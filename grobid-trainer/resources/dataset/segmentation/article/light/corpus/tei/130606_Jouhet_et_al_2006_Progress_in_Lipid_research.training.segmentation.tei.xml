			<body>1. Introduction <lb/> Plant cell membranes contain a wide range of glycerolipids which are not randomly allocated. <lb/>A selective distribution at the levels of subcellular organelles, membrane leaflets and <lb/>membrane domains indicates a complex and finely tuned lipid homeostasis. Additionally, the <lb/>distribution remains relatively well conserved among tissues and plants species (Table 1). In <lb/>standard plant culture conditions, on one hand, glycolipids, i.e. sulfolipid and galactolipids, <lb/>are restricted to plastid membranes and, on the other hand, phospholipids are the main <lb/>components of extraplastidic membranes. PE is excluded from plastidic membranes, PC is <lb/>absent from the inner membranes of chloroplasts and DPG is restricted to mitochondria inner <lb/>membrane. Sterols and glycosphingolipids are present in plant membranes although in much <lb/>lower amounts than glycerolipids [for reviews see 1, 2]. Like in mammalian cells, sterols and <lb/>glycosphingolipids are not homogenously distributed among membranes and are notably <lb/>present in the plasma membrane where they are likely involved in membrane domain <lb/>organisation. <lb/>In plants, phosphate deprivation has been reported to decrease the phospholipid content, <lb/>consistent with a mobilization of the phosphate reserve, and conversely to increase non-<lb/>phosphorous membrane lipids such as DGDG and SQDG [3, 4]. Moreover a form of DGDG <lb/>with specific fatty acids: 16:0 at glycerol sn1 position and 18:2 at sn2 position is especially <lb/>enhanced [5, 6]. Correlated to the lipid composition changes there is also a strong <lb/>modification of the lipid distribution between membranes. Upon phosphate deprivation, <lb/>DGDG, a specific plastid lipid in standard conditions, was found in the plasma membrane [7, <lb/>8], a membranous compartment disconnected from plastid membranes, but dynamically <lb/>connected to the overall endomembrane system. Moreover, several lines of evidence have <lb/>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			shown that large amounts of DGDG are also present in mitochondria upon phosphate <lb/>deprivation [9]. <lb/>One cannot explain the membrane specific lipid distribution only by metabolic processes <lb/>confined in each membrane compartment simply because most lipids are not just present in <lb/>membranes where they were synthesised. The lipid distribution is usually stable despite the <lb/>extensive membrane trafficking that occurs between organelles. The maintained specific lipid <lb/>distribution relies therefore on molecular mechanisms of lipid transport. These mechanisms <lb/>have been studied mostly in yeast and in mammalian cells [for a review 10] and very few data <lb/>have been collected in plant models. Besides information from genetics and proteomics <lb/>analyses, we believe that disturbance of lipid distribution during phosphate deprivation <lb/>represents a promising tool to unravel these molecular mechanisms in plants. In this review, <lb/>we discuss recent data describing the potential mechanisms involved in glycerolipid <lb/>trafficking in plant cells, including recently described membrane lipid reorganization during <lb/>phosphate deprivation. <lb/> 2. Membrane glycerolipid diffusion <lb/> Membrane lipids are subjected to three kinds of dispersive forces: lateral diffusion, diffusion <lb/>across membranes (flip-flop) and movement outside the source membrane, possibly reaching <lb/>other membranes through aqueous phase. Based on the very rapid spontaneous lateral <lb/>diffusion of lipids within membrane lateral surfaces (0.1 to 1 µm 2 .s -1 ; [11]), the lipid <lb/>distribution in vesicular connected organelles should be homogenous. The fact that this is <lb/>clearly not the case indicates that very dynamic homeostatic mechanisms are involved to <lb/>maintain the lipid composition of each organelle. <lb/>In comparison with lateral diffusion, lipid diffusion between the two leaflets of a membrane <lb/>bilayer or from one membrane to another is very slow (Figure 1). The spontaneous flip-flop <lb/>
			
			<page>7 <lb/></page>
			
			movement through a lipid bilayer takes less than one second for DAG but it takes hours for <lb/>lipids with larger polar heads [12]. <lb/>Lipid diffusion between different membranes is fast for single fatty acid chain lipids that <lb/>easily partition into the aqueous phase, like lysoPC, or lipids containing two short fatty acid <lb/>chain (4 to 6 carbons) [12, 13]. By contrast, there is almost no spontaneous transfer of regular <lb/>diacyl lipids although this trafficking is essential for organelle functioning and cell survival. <lb/>Vesicular and non-vesicular transport systems have been reported in plants as in other <lb/>eukaryotic cells. The vesicular pathway supports a complex membrane flow which couples <lb/>lipid and protein movements while non-vesicular pathways require monomeric exchange of <lb/>single lipid molecules. Unlike the vesicular pathway, non-vesicular pathways do not involve <lb/>membrane fusions but rather tight contacts between membranes. A number of enzymes are <lb/>required to ensure and regulate lipid movements and it is likely that enzymes are also <lb/>necessary to control lateral and transbilayer movements both at membrane fusion points in <lb/>vesicular processes and at contact sites in non-vesicular processes. <lb/> 3. Flip-flop movements <lb/> Several types of flip-flop movement exist [for review, see 14]. The spontaneous movement <lb/>across the bilayer is dependent only on the physical and chemical properties of lipids and <lb/>membranes. In vivo, DAG movement seems mostly driven by diffusive forces whereas <lb/>proteins are required for significant rates of phospholipid and glycolipid transbilayer <lb/>movements. Energy-independent flippases catalyse an ATP-independent movement, in which <lb/>lipids probably move along the polar surface created by these proteins [15]. These flippases <lb/>can be specific for some lipid classes but they cannot assist the movement of lipids against a <lb/>physicochemical gradient. They maintain bilayer symmetry by contrast with ATP-dependent <lb/>
			
			<page>8 <lb/></page>
			
			translocases that can accumulate specific lipid classes against equilibrated gradients. ATP-<lb/>dependent translocases are involved in the preservation of membrane asymmetry [16]. <lb/> 3.1. Energy-independent flippases <lb/> To our knowledge, no flippase has been characterized in plant cells although some gene <lb/>sequences exhibit homologies with flippases from other organisms. The biosynthesis of ER <lb/>phospholipids is supposed to be localised in the cytosolic leaflet like in other eukaryotic cells <lb/>[17], therefore half of the newly synthesised lipids has to be transferred to the other leaflet. In <lb/>yeast and mammalian cells, the ATP-independent flip-flop movement in the ER membrane is <lb/>ten times faster than in membranes that do not contain proteins. This movement is sensitive to <lb/>proteases [14] but it is unclear whether it involves a dedicated type of enzymes or the mere <lb/>presence of proteins. Interestingly, peptides that mimic the 񮽙-helices of transmembrane <lb/>proteins can stimulate phospholipid flip-flop in liposomes [18]. Enhanced flippase-type <lb/>transfers are also necessary at membrane contact sites where lipids should be transferred from <lb/>the cytosolic leaflet of the donor membrane to the cytosolic leaflet of the acceptor membrane <lb/>[19]. It is possible that such flippases are involved in the transfer of DGDG from chloroplasts <lb/>to mitochondria during phosphate deprivation since this transfer seems related to membrane <lb/>contact [9 and see below]. <lb/>The first flippases that have been characterized in eukaryotic cells are the RFT1 protein, a <lb/>yeast reticulum pyrophosphoryloligosaccharide-dolichol flippase [20], and the scramblase, a <lb/>red blood cell plasma membrane calcium-dependent flippase [21]. RFT1 transfers dolichol <lb/>from the reticulum cytosolic leaflet, where it is synthesised, to the lumenal leaflet where it is <lb/>eventually located [20]. In Arabidopsis, one RFT1 homologue can be retrieved (At5g07630), <lb/>but is still functionally uncharacterized. In red blood cell membranes, sphingomyelin and <lb/>most of the PC are located in the plasma membrane outer leaflet whereas PS and a part of the <lb/>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			PE are in the cytosolic leaflet. An increase of calcium influx activates the scramblase, which <lb/>equilibrates the phospholipid composition between the two plasma membrane leaflets, by <lb/>catalysing bidirectional transfer of each lipid species. Movement of PS to the outer leaflet can <lb/>subsequently induce blood coagulation [21]. In Arabidopsis, a scramblase-related gene has a <lb/>weak but significant similarity (At2g04940) and should be examined in the context of lipid <lb/>transfers. <lb/> 3.2. Energy-dependent translocases <lb/> In plants, many reports highlight asymmetric distributions of lipids in several membranes. <lb/>The plant plasma membrane is asymmetric, like in red blood cells, and PS externalisation can <lb/>induce cell death processes [22]. The above-mentioned scramblase-like plant protein may <lb/>play a role in affecting the plasma membrane asymmetry. The thylakoids show a marked <lb/>asymmetry in the transversal distribution of the lipids with an enrichment of the outer leaflet <lb/>in MGDG and PG while DGDG and SQDG are essentially confined to the inner leaflet [23]. <lb/>Since these lipids are linked to specific structures of the photosystems, the lipid asymmetry of <lb/>the thylakoids is likely to reflect the organisation of the photosynthetic machinery [24]. It has <lb/>also been proposed that the asymmetry is preestablished in the inner envelope membrane due <lb/>to the topography of lipid synthesising proteins and is transferred to thylakoids by membrane <lb/>fusion [25]. In the plastid two-membrane envelope, PC is present only in the cytosolic leaflet <lb/>of the outer membrane [26]. The tonoplast membrane exhibits a slight asymmetry due to a <lb/>higher amount of PE in the cytosolic leaflet [27]. The biological significance of the <lb/>asymmetry of plastid envelope and tonoplast membranes is still unknown but is possibly <lb/>related to signalling or membrane identification mechanism. <lb/>Two translocase families are well documented. The first family includes aminophospholipid <lb/>translocases that belongs to the P-type ATPase superfamily. The first identified enzyme of <lb/>
			
			<page>10 <lb/></page>
			
			this family was DRS2, a yeast translocase [28]. The drs2 mutant is cold-sensitive and has no <lb/>asymmetrical accumulation of PS in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Although the <lb/>initial study was controversial, new data supports the proposal that DRS2 plays a role in the <lb/>translocation of lipids in the trans-Golgi and endosomal compartments during budding of <lb/>membrane vesicles [for review, see 14]. In Arabidopsis, eleven genes belong to this family <lb/>(ALA1 to ALA11) (Table 2). ALA1 exhibits the strongest homology to DRS2 and its <lb/>expression in drs2 yeast mutant restores cold resistance and internalisation of the plasma <lb/>membrane PS [29]. However, ALA1 localization and function in planta are not characterized. <lb/>Furthermore, the roles of the other ALA proteins remain speculative. <lb/>The second family belongs to the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein superfamily that <lb/>comprises transporters for a whole variety of organic and inorganic compounds. Typically, <lb/>ABC proteins possess two nucleotide-binding domains and two transmembrane domains. <lb/>Multi-drug resistance studies in cancerous cells and in yeast first suggested that some ABC <lb/>transporters participated in the externalisation of plasma membrane lipids and there are now <lb/>many indications for lipid transport mediated by ABC proteins in cellular membranes [for <lb/>reviews, see 30, 31]. Arabidopsis contains 129 genes belonging to this family [32]. Data on <lb/>plant ABC transporters indicate that they play a key role in numerous processes necessary for <lb/>plant development: chlorophyll biosynthesis, iron-sulphur cluster formation, stomata <lb/>movement and possibly ionic fluxes [for review, see 33]. Recent reports have pointed out <lb/>their role in plant lipid transport (Table 2). A potential transporter of plastid fatty acids, <lb/>identified in the Arabidopsis genome (At1g54350), belongs to this family [34]. The major site <lb/>of de novo synthesis of fatty acids in plant cells is the plastid stroma. Fatty acids are produced <lb/>predominantly as C18:1-ACP and C16:0-ACP and are metabolic substrates for numerous <lb/>pathways such as membrane glycerolipid biosyntheses in the plastid envelope as well as in the <lb/>
			
			<page>11 <lb/></page>
			
			ER [for a review see 2]. An acyl-ACP thioesterase, localized in the inner envelope membrane, <lb/>can hydrolyze acyl-ACP and release free fatty acids. Free fatty acids released from the inner <lb/>envelope are channelled to the outer envelope, possibly via the At1g54350 ABC transporter <lb/>and reactivated to acyl-CoA in the outer envelope [35]. <lb/>Xu et al. identified another chloroplastic ABC type protein (TGD1) (At1g19800) that is likely <lb/>dedicated to the import of phosphatidate from the ER to the chloroplast for the synthesis of <lb/>eukaryotic galactoglycerolipids [36, 37]. The so-called prokaryotic and eukaryotic types of <lb/>galactoglycerolipid structures exist in plants [for a review see 2]. Both types are generated in <lb/>the chloroplast envelope by galactosylation of DAG molecular species of distinct origins. <lb/>Whereas prokaryotic DAG is fully synthesized in plastids, eukaryotic DAG originates from <lb/>PC formed in the ER. Studies with labelled lipid precursors indicated that PC provides its <lb/>eukaryotic DAG backbone to plastid glycerolipids [38, 39]. This transfer requires desaturated <lb/>PC since the fad2 Arabidopsis mutant, deficient in the desaturation of C18:1 localised in ER, <lb/>contains a smaller eukaryotic/prokaryotic monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) ratio than <lb/>wild type plants [40]. Although PC is present in the outer membrane of the plastid envelope, <lb/>the only known site of PC de novo biosynthesis is localised in the ER. A direct import of PC <lb/>from ER, or an import of intermediates derived from endoplasmic reticulum PC, possibly <lb/>DAG or phosphatidate, is therefore required for the synthesis of eukaryotic galactolipids <lb/>(Figure 2). It is still unclear which lipid is transported. Some clues have been deduced from <lb/>the in-depth examination of lipids of plant cell suspensions after transferring the cells into a <lb/>phosphate-deprived medium [6]. Since phosphate starvation induced a high increase in the <lb/>synthesis of eukaryotic DGDG (notably the above-mentioned 16:0-18:2 molecular species), <lb/>the exposure to phosphate starvation conditions was therefore a way to analyze the passage of <lb/>the DAG-backbone from the ER PC to the plastid galactolipids. Phosphate starvation induced <lb/>
			
			<page>12 <lb/></page>
			
			an increase of DAG with an identical fatty acid composition as PC. Since DAG was not <lb/>detected in plastid membranes and a phosphatidate pool was not detected in the cells, Jouhet <lb/> et al. proposed that DAG is the molecule transported from ER to chloroplast. Several <lb/>phospholipases C specifically activated during Pi deprivation are probably involved in the <lb/>formation of this DAG pool [41, 42]. The transferred DAG is presumably galactosylated into <lb/>MGDG and DGDG through the actions of the enzymes MGD2 (or MGD3) and DGD1 (or <lb/>DGD2) induced by phosphate deprivation and present in the outer envelope membrane. <lb/>However, the existence of a phospholipase D (PLD񮽙2) activated by phosphate deprivation <lb/>[42, 43], the accumulation of phosphatidate in the tgd1 mutant and the localization of TGD1 <lb/>in the chloroplast inner envelope membrane [37] suggest that the transported molecule could <lb/>be phosphatidate. To understand this latter scheme, the precise localization of the <lb/>phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) involved in the transformation of eukaryotic <lb/>phosphatidate into DAG is crucial since part of the eukaryotic DAG is galactosylated by <lb/>MGD1, the constitutive MGDG synthase that is present in the inner envelope membrane. In <lb/>some plants such as spinach, PAP has been detected in the inner envelope membrane and this <lb/>was considered to be dedicated to the formation of prokaryotic DAG [for a review see 2]. <lb/>Therefore, either this PAP is also involved in the formation of eukaryotic DAG or a <lb/>complementary transport of eukaryotic DAG is necessary. Moreover, in some other plants <lb/>such as pea, even though MGDG synthase is present in the inner envelope membrane, PAP <lb/>activity has never been detected in the envelope, possibly related to the fact that no <lb/>prokaryotic DAG is formed in these plants. Therefore, at least in plants such as pea, transport <lb/>of eukaryotic DAG up to the inner envelope membrane is necessary to ensure MGDG <lb/>synthesis and thylakoid development. Altogether, it is likely that in all plants eukaryotic DAG <lb/>is transported from the ER to the inner envelope membrane. Recent findings from the tgd1 <lb/>
			
			<page>13 <lb/></page>
			
			mutant analysis indicate that eukaryotic phosphatidate is also transported to the inner <lb/>envelope membrane where it plays a role in enhancing of MGDG synthesis (Figure 2). <lb/> 4. Vesicular lipid transfer <lb/> 4.1. Secretory pathway <lb/> Since most phospholipids, sterol, sphingolipid and many proteins are synthesized in the ER, <lb/>this compartment can be considered as a cell central metabolic organelle in relation with other <lb/>compartments. During interphase, the ER is in direct connection with the nucleus. On electron <lb/>micrographs, the ER and nucleus membranes appear as connected, although a lumen <lb/>constriction is observed at the junction area [44]. With or without Golgi participation, the ER <lb/>is involved in protein and lipid supply for the vacuolar and plasma membranes by vesicles <lb/>moving along actin filaments [45]. <lb/>The general mechanism of vesicular transfer is carried out in several steps [for reviews see, <lb/>46, 47]. Briefly, small type Ras GTPases, coupled to GTP exchange factors, support the <lb/>recruiting of protein complexes and their anchoring to the donor membrane. Coat proteins, <lb/>like adaptatin or clathrin, can participate with these complexes. Then, vesicles extrude from <lb/>the donor membrane (following mechanisms that remain to be fully characterized), and move <lb/>away using the actin cytoskeleton and myosin. Dynamin, a large GTPase is involved in the <lb/>scission of nascent vesicles from the parent membrane. Anchoring and fusion to the target <lb/>membrane are mediated by SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment <lb/>protein REceptors) proteins, located both on the vesicles (v-SNARE) and on the target <lb/>membrane (t-SNARE), and small GTPases. <lb/>This process has been intensively studied at the level of protein trafficking and, although <lb/>vesicles obviously transfer lipid material, very little data on lipids exist. In the following <lb/>paragraphs, we present current information on the molecular machineries involved in <lb/>
			
			<page>14 <lb/></page>
			
			vesicular trafficking in plants, specifically in endomembranes (Figure 3) and from chloroplast <lb/>envelope to thylakoids. This is then developed in relation to specific lipid transfers. <lb/> 4.1.1. Reticulum and Golgi exchanges <lb/> These exchanges are mediated by transport vesicles that bud from the donor membrane due to <lb/>the assembly of a cytosolic coat protein known as coatomer protein I or II. Vesicles <lb/>containing these proteins are called respectively COPI and COPII. The ER to Golgi pathway <lb/>transfers phospholipids, sterols, sphingolipids and proteins. In mammalian and yeast, this <lb/>transfer is mediated by COPII-type coated vesicles. In plants, the Golgi apparatus is close to <lb/>the ER but, although proteins exhibiting substantial homology with partners of the COPII <lb/>complex are known, it was never possible to visualize any COPII-type vesicles. The ER to <lb/>Golgi transfer does not seem to imply a vesicular stage [48]. It probably works with the <lb/>COPII machinery but a COPII independent pathway is also possible [49]. Surprisingly, the <lb/>transfer from ER to Golgi is independent of actin or microtubules [50]. The long-standing <lb/>contact between the reticulum and the Golgi is apparently sufficient to support the transfer. <lb/>Several studies have shown the existence of a Golgi to ER pathway in plants presumably <lb/>working through COPI vesicles [48]. There is no doubt that the COPI machinery exists in <lb/>plants and it is likely that COPI and COPII pathways are interdependent due to the necessity <lb/>for recycling the regulatory machinery of the secretory pathway. The exact role of COPI <lb/>vesicles in the Golgi to ER transfer has been a matter of controversy mostly because much of <lb/>the information comes from use of the secretory pathway inhibitor BFA, which affects also <lb/>the ER to Golgi pathway. No data is available about the importance of this COPI and COPII <lb/>trafficking on the lipid distribution in the cell. <lb/> 4.1.2. Transfer to the vacuoles <lb/> In plants, two types of vacuoles exist. On one hand, the storage vacuole is present in the <lb/>storage tissues, like cotyledons and endosperm. It is characterised by a neutral pH and by the <lb/>
			
			<page>15 <lb/></page>
			
			presence of񮽙񮽙-TIP (tonoplast integral protein) and storage proteins, like prolamins and <lb/>globulins. On the other hand, the lytic vacuole of vegetative tissues is characterised by an <lb/>acidic pH and presence of 񮽙-TIP and lumenal proteins. Theses two vacuoles have different <lb/>protein-sorting mechanisms [44], and little is known about their lipid sorting. <lb/>Although the storage vacuole lipid composition is not yet characterised, different mechanisms <lb/>of transfers are identified depending on tissues and plant species. Two types of vesicles are <lb/>possibly present: the first type originating from the ER, corresponds to the so-called <lb/> &quot;precursor-accumulating compartment&quot; that contains prolamins; the other type (deriving from <lb/>the Golgi), corresponds to dense vesicles that contain globulins [51]. Altogether, proteins <lb/>destined for the storage vacuole have an addressing domain in their C-terminal and their <lb/>transfer involves the activation by PI-4P phosphoinositide since this trafficking is sensitive to <lb/>Wortmaninn, a PI-kinase inhibitor [52]. <lb/>The lytic vacuole can be compared to animal lysosomes. Lipids from clathrin-coated vesicles <lb/>are transferred from the Golgi to a prevacuolar compartment, with the intervention of the actin <lb/>cytoskeleton and dynamin [45]. Transfer between the prevacuolar compartment and the lytic <lb/>vacuole is not yet characterised. PI-3P is involved in the vesicular transfer from the Golgi to <lb/>the lytic vacuole. In animals and yeast, a protein called EEA (Early Endosome Antigen) binds <lb/>PI-3P with the participation of RabF GTPase and drives to the endosome fusion. The <lb/>overexpression of the EEA PI-3P binding domain in Arabidopsis showed that this domain <lb/>was sorted gradually from the Golgi to the lytic vacuole via the prevacuolar compartment. By <lb/>competition mechanism, this overexpression inhibited the trafficking of vacuole proteins <lb/>while trapping free PI-3P [53]. The plant ADL6 dynamin, that binds adaptatin and actin, has a <lb/>PI-3P specific PH domain (phosphoinositide recognition domain) and its mutation abolished <lb/>the trafficking of vacuole proteins. ADL6 is therefore an important protein that connects PI-<lb/>
			
			<page>16 <lb/></page>
			
			3P local concentration and sorting to the vacuole [54]. However, nothing is known about the <lb/>lipid composition and the lipid selectivity of all these vesicles. <lb/> 4.1.3. Transfer to the plasma membrane <lb/> The plant cell plasma membrane is not homogenous and domains are detected. A domain is a <lb/>membrane area, organised or not, whose lipid and/or protein composition differs from the <lb/>bulk membrane composition. For example, rafts are membrane domains that resist detergent <lb/>solubilization due to a special lipid/protein local composition. Lipid rafts were recently <lb/>characterised in Tobacco and Arabidopsis [55, 56]. Rafts are enriched in sterols and <lb/>sphingolipids and recruit a pool of specific proteins. Some other plant plasma membrane <lb/>domains have been characterized by their divergent protein composition and their position in <lb/>the cell: for example, in vascular cells, the auxin efflux transporter, PIN1, is localised in the <lb/>basal pole whereas the auxin influx transporter is found at the apical pole [46]. <lb/>The plasma membrane derives from uncharacterized Golgi vesicles. Lipid trafficking from the <lb/>Golgi to the plasma membrane occurs partly through these transport vesicles. The nature of <lb/>the vesicles is not yet identified although the following data support their existence. It has <lb/>been recently shown by live imaging of animal cells that transport vesicles from the Golgi <lb/>directly fuse with the plasma membrane [57]. Consistently, in plant, monensin, a secretory <lb/>pathway inhibitor, was shown to cause accumulation of part of the plasma membrane lipids in <lb/>the Golgi [1]. This pathway is actin dependent [45]. The addressing of proteins to the plasma <lb/>membrane seems to be controlled by the size and number of their hydrophobic domains [58]. <lb/>Thus, preferential interactions between lipids and transmembrane proteins were proposed to <lb/>manage protein sorting in the Golgi. In the future, it will be important to define the precise <lb/>origins and fusion sites of vesicles in order to understand the general formation of the plasma <lb/>membrane and the genesis of particular microdomains. Concerning rafts, one can suggest that, <lb/>
			
			<page>17 <lb/></page>
			
			according to animal cell data, domains may be organized in the Golgi and subsequently <lb/>exported to the plasma membrane [59]. <lb/>PIP 2 plays a role in the transport to the plasma membrane [60]. A PI transfer protein (PI-TP) <lb/>was identified in Arabidopsis and was shown to be a SEC14 homolog allowing the <lb/>complementation of a yeast sec14 mutant. In yeast, the inactivation of SEC14 impedes protein <lb/>secretion at the Golgi level. Interestingly, mutations in genes involved in the nucleotidic <lb/>pathway for PC biosynthesis abolish the effect of the sec14 mutation. In fact, SEC14 binds <lb/>both PC and PI and is a phosphocholine:CTP cytidylyltransferase inhibitor. It has been <lb/>proposed that SEC14 was a &quot; sensor &quot; of the plasma membrane lipid composition and could <lb/>inhibit PC biosynthesis when PC is abundant. This hypothetical role has not been confirmed <lb/> in planta [61]. Another PI-TP, AtSfh1p, belonging to the SEC14-nodulin family, was <lb/>identified in Arabidopsis. AtSfh1p is likely a regulator of the intracellular trafficking in root <lb/>hair by moving PIP 2 to the areas of the plasma membrane where vesicles fuse [62]. <lb/>By using monensin, Moreau et al. [1] tried to determine which lipid classes were transferred <lb/>to plant plasma membrane via the vesicular pathway. When monensin was added, these <lb/>authors observed in the plasma membrane the absence of PS, whereas the PI content was not <lb/>affected, and PE and PC amounts were half reduced. Based on these results, they concluded <lb/>that PS was exclusively transferred to the plasma membrane by vesicular pathway, PE and PC <lb/>were partly transferred by the vesicular pathway and PI was transferred by another process. <lb/>However Vincent et al. [63] observed that PS could also be synthesised directly in the plasma <lb/>membrane by polar head exchange. The balance between PS from Golgi vesicles and PS <lb/>generated by plasma membrane polar head exchange is unknown. <lb/> 4.1.4. Endocytosis and exocytosis <lb/> Plant endocytosis was questioned for long due to the turgid pressure and cell wall rigidity that <lb/>were supposed to prevent its existence. It is now well established that brefeldin A, an <lb/>
			
			<page>18 <lb/></page>
			
			exocytosis inhibitor, induces the internalisation of plasma membrane proteins, like the auxin-<lb/>carrier proteins AUX1 and PIN1, in a compartment called the endosome [45]. The distinction <lb/>between the endosome and prevacuolar compartments is not clear [64] because the fate of <lb/>internalised proteins divides in two parts: a part is recycled to the plasma membrane and the <lb/>other destined for the lytic vacuole. <lb/>Plant endocytosis implies at least two pathways: one is catalysed by clathrin-coated vesicles <lb/>that are transported by the actin cytoskeleton and moved by myosin VIII [45]; another one, <lb/>like the PIN endocytosis, depends on presence of sterols and of rafts [65]. In plants, no <lb/>receptor for addressing sequences to clathrin-coated vesicles has been identified despite <lb/>pointed homologies with some yeast receptors in the Arabidopsis genome [64]. However, two <lb/>subunits of the AP2 adaptatin complex, 񮽙C-adaptatin and AP180, were characterised in <lb/> Arabidopsis. AP180 catalyses clathrin assembly and񮽙񮽙C-adaptatin binds to AP180 and to a <lb/>dynamin like protein, probably ADL1 [66]. <lb/>The transfer from endosome/prevacuolar compartment to lytic vacuole is not characterized <lb/>besides a PI-3P control [46]. In contrast, the mechanism of vesicle recycling to plasma <lb/>membrane is partially characterized. The recycling machinery is actin-dependent and involves <lb/>Arf1, GNOM and PIN since brefeldin A, an exocytosis inhibitor, aborts the recycling of the <lb/>PIN auxin efflux facilitators to plasma membrane by inhibiting GNOM activity, i.e. GDP-<lb/>GTP exchange on Arf1, a small GTPase. This pathway is involved in the transfer of other <lb/>proteins than PIN such as AUX1 and some ATPases. <lb/>To conclude, very few studies concern glycerolipid trafficking through the secretory pathway. <lb/>Altogether data indicate the following general features: a) ER-Golgi trafficking has no <lb/>glycerolipid specificity whereas b) there is some selectivity concerning trafficking to the <lb/>plasma membrane from the Golgi apparatus. In this case, PS is mainly transported by vesicles, <lb/>
			
			<page>19 <lb/></page>
			
			PE and PC are partially transferred by this route and PI is moved by another method <lb/>(independent of the secretory pathway). Moreover, PI has an additional role in the regulation <lb/>of trafficking. Different phosphorylated forms of PI favour sorting of vesicles to distinct <lb/>compartments: PI-4P to storage vacuole, PI-3P to lytic vacuole and PIP 2 to plasma membrane. <lb/> 4.2. Transfer from the plastid envelope to the thylakoids <lb/> Glycerolipids i.e. MGDG, DGDG, PG and sulfolipid, synthesised in the plastid envelope [for <lb/>review see 2] are selectively transported from the envelope inner membrane to the thylakoids <lb/>[67, 25]. Our knowledge about this lipid transfer mechanism is very imprecise but there are <lb/>some indications supporting vesicular trafficking. Vesicle budding from the plastid envelope <lb/>inner membrane was observed by electronic microscopy [68, 69]. An Arabidopsis thaliana <lb/> thylakoid formation 1 (Thf 1) gene product was shown to control a step required for the <lb/>organization of vesicles derived from the envelope inner membrane into mature thylakoid <lb/>stacks [70]. Bioinformatic studies suggest that a system similar to the COPII vesicular <lb/>pathway is present in plastids [71]. The plastid vesicular pathway is dependent on ATP and <lb/>stromal proteins [72, 73]. Some stromal proteins involved in this trafficking have been <lb/>identified: a NSF homolog protein [74], a dynamin-like protein [75] and a vesicle inducing <lb/>protein (VIPP1) [76]. In vipp1 (a VIPP -Vesicle Inducing Protein in Plastid 1-deleted mutant), <lb/>thylakoid membrane formation and chloroplast vesicle transport are abolished, indicating that <lb/>VIPP1 is essential for thylakoid maintenance by a vesicular pathway. Recent data demonstrate <lb/>that VIPP1 organizes in a high molecular mass complex closely associated with the inner <lb/>envelope membrane and suggest that the C-terminus of the protein protrudes from the <lb/>complex into the stroma of chloroplasts possibly for interaction with some other proteins <lb/>[77]. Accordingly, soluble VIPP1 interacts with a HSP70B/CDJ2 chaperone pair [78]. By <lb/>analogy with the action of the auxilin/Hsc70 chaperone pair with clathrin on clathrin-coated <lb/>
			
			<page>20 <lb/></page>
			
			vesicles, HSP70B/CDJ2 might disassemble and/or assemble VIPP1 oligomers to recycle the <lb/>system for another turn of vesicle formation/transport [78]. <lb/> 5. Transfer by membrane contact <lb/> Whereas vesicular pathways are involved in the lipid provisioning for thylakoids and <lb/>organelles of the secretory pathway, this process does not provide every necessary lipid for <lb/>the plasma membrane. In addition, the secretory pathway is apparently not involved in the <lb/>important lipid transfer from ER to plastids and from ER to mitochondria since no isolated <lb/>vesicle has been clearly detected between ER and these semi autonomous organelles. Another <lb/>type of lipid transfer has been proposed involving membrane contact between two organelles <lb/>[79]. By contrast with vesicular trafficking, transfer by contact does not involve a transfer of a <lb/>portion of a bilayer as such but a selective transfer of some components of the membrane. In <lb/>plants, some indications of a lipid transfer by membrane contact between plastid envelope and <lb/>mitochondria were recently reported [9]. <lb/> 5.1. Membrane contact sites <lb/> In a topological plan at the cell scale, ER has many specialised sub domains that interact with <lb/>other organelles such as mitochondria, vacuole, plasma membrane or plastids [44] (Figure 4). <lb/>At a membrane contact site, membranes are typically separated by less than 10 nm [10]. The <lb/>best-characterized membrane contact site was described in yeast between ER and <lb/>mitochondria [19] during a study of the mechanisms for PE biosynthesis in mitochondria [80]. <lb/>PE biosynthesis in mitochondria occurs by decarboxylation of PS and is dependent on PS <lb/>supply by ER [79]. Specific ER domains called MAM (Mitochondria Associated Membranes) <lb/>are enriched in PS synthase, supporting PS supply to mitochondria. The PS transfer from ER <lb/>to the mitochondria outer membrane is not completely characterized. Data indicate ATP <lb/>dependence of PS transfer, Ca2+ and Mg2+ stimulation, participation of a S100B protein <lb/>
			
			<page>21 <lb/></page>
			
			(Ca2+-modulated protein of the EF-hand type) that binds calcium and can interact with <lb/>annexin, and existence of a regulatory system involving a SCF (Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein) <lb/>ubiquitin ligase [19]. PS is finally transported to the mitochondria inner membrane by an <lb/>unknown mechanism, maybe going through contact sites between the inner and outer <lb/>membranes of mitochondria [81]. PS is decarboxylated in the mitochondria inner membrane <lb/>to form PE before a retro-transfer to ER probably going also through MAM [79]. Plants are <lb/>known to synthesize ethanolamine moieties of PE mainly by decarboxylation of free serine, <lb/>but there is also some evidence for PS decarboxylation, with both mitochondrial and <lb/>extramitochondrial PS decarboxylases [82, 83]. It is very likely that, in plants, the same kind <lb/>of PS transfer through MAM occurs for synthesis of some part of the mitochondrial PE. In <lb/>addition, MAM are also possibly involved in transfer of other mitochondrial phospholipids <lb/>synthesized in ER such as PC and PE. <lb/>Concerning transfer from ER to plasma membranes, it is believed, based on yeast studies, that <lb/>PE is transferred by a similar kind of system involving PAM (Plasma membrane Associated <lb/>Membrane) domains [10]. In plant, PAM-plasma membrane interactions contain actin <lb/>cytoskeleton elements and are sensitive to cell wall digestion [84]. <lb/>Finally, similar interactions by membrane contacts were observed between ER and vacuoles. <lb/>The ER anchoring to vacuole or to plasma membrane may serve as semi-immobile platforms <lb/>to which actin filaments attach to drive endoplasmic streaming [44]. These contact sites <lb/>possibly participate in the monensin insensitive transfer of PE, PC and PI, previously <lb/>described, with the involvement of LTPs (see below). <lb/>By analogy with MAM, PLAM (PLastid Associated Membrane) are supposed to be present at <lb/>the periphery of the chloroplast [85]. PLAM could contribute to the transfer of eukaryotic <lb/>DAG backbone from ER to plastids as described above. They could also facilitate the transfer <lb/>
			
			<page>22 <lb/></page>
			
			of PC from the ER to the outer membrane of the chloroplast envelope (Figure 2). Actually, <lb/>partial hydrolysis of PC to LysoPC in the ER was proposed to favour PC transfer between ER <lb/>and chloroplast since amphiphilic lysoPC can move easily through the cytosol [86]. In support <lb/>to this hypothesis, a lysoPC acyltransferase activity was detected in the chloroplast envelope <lb/>[86]. <lb/>Plant organelles are mobile inside the cell. Therefore, they can create membrane contact sites <lb/>adapted to physiological need. Each organelle has its own mechanism for location within the <lb/>cell and all organelle positions are coordinated in order to let each organelle fulfil its function <lb/>[87]. These movements are mainly actin-dependent in vegetative cells and this mobility <lb/>supports formation of organelle contact sites. <lb/>Plastids produce also very dynamic tubular structures called stromules that are able to interact <lb/>with other plastids and even with other type of organelles (Figure 4). Stromules are highly <lb/>dynamic structures involving both membranes of the plastid envelope and containing stroma <lb/>[for review, see 88]. In different tissues of tobacco and Arabidopsis, stromules interact with <lb/>the nucleus, the plasma membrane and mitochondria. They possibly support transfers such as <lb/>DAG, PC or DGDG transfers, although this role of stromules has never been demonstrated <lb/>[89, 90]. Other plastid envelope structures have been visualised to resemble myelin. These <lb/>structures were proposed to favour transfer of substances from plastid to vacuoles [91]. <lb/> 5.2. Lipid transfer protein or LTP <lb/> Lipid-transfer proteins that shuttle across cytosolic gaps mediate the trafficking of particular <lb/>lipids between organelles [10]. These proteins have to target both donor and acceptor <lb/>membranes and, indeed, some LTP have been localized at membrane contact sites where two <lb/>membranes were in close proximity [92]. For instance, LTPs of the Osh multigenic family <lb/>(Osh1, 2 and 3) were localised at reticulum contact sites in yeast. Osh LTPs belong to the <lb/>
			
			<page>23 <lb/></page>
			
			oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) family and are presumably involved in the movement of <lb/>sterol among cellular compartments, as was recently demonstrated for Osh4p [93]. In <lb/> Arabidopsis, twelve homologs of OSBP were identified but none has been studied yet (Table <lb/>2). Some LTPs have two targeting domains, one for the lipid donor membrane and the other <lb/>for the lipid receptor membrane. Consequently, LTPs can either move from one membrane to <lb/>another or bind to both membranes at the same time [10]. Holthuis and Levine pointed that <lb/>simultaneous binding to both membranes should promote lipid transport. Since the absence of <lb/>membrane fusion is a characteristic of membrane contact sites, one can question which <lb/>proteins are involved for the stabilisation of the membrane contact sites and whether LTP may <lb/>contribute to such stabilization. <lb/>To date, only one protein &quot; bridge &quot; between two organelles has been characterized between <lb/>the nucleus and the vacuole in yeast [94]. This &quot; bridge &quot; contains one nuclear envelope outer <lb/>membrane protein (Nvj1p) that docks to a vacuole surface protein (Vac8p). This binding <lb/>supports the formation of membrane contact sites between these two organelles without <lb/>membrane fusion. <lb/>Other LTP families were characterised without any information concerning their possible <lb/>localization to membrane contact sites. StART (Steroidogenic-Acute-Response protein related <lb/>lipid Transfer protein) proteins have a conserved domain around 200 amino acids involved in <lb/>lipid or sterol binding. A protein of the StART family, CERT (CEramide Related Transfer <lb/>protein), was recently characterised in mammalian cells [95]. CERT has a reticulum and a <lb/>Golgi binding domain and transfers ceramide from the reticulum to the Golgi. <lb/>Thirty-five proteins containing StART domains were identified in Arabidopsis. No CERT <lb/>close homolog was found in plants, but six proteins are homologues to StARD2, a PC-binding <lb/>protein [96]. The in silico studies of StARD2 homolog genes suggest that their products are <lb/>
			
			<page>24 <lb/></page>
			
			addressed either to mitochondria, or to plastids or to the secretory pathway (Table 2). These <lb/>proteins are possible candidates for the vesicular independent trafficking of PC, the eukaryotic <lb/>DAG backbone or of the minus Pi-induced mitochondrial DGDG. <lb/>The GLTP (GLycolipid Transfer Protein) family includes proteins involved mainly in <lb/>glycosphingolipid transfer; this family contains four genes in the Arabidopsis genome (Table <lb/>2). The Arabidopsis ACD11 protein is involved in the cell death mechanism and, by contrast <lb/>with the mammalian protein, it transfers only sphingosine [97]. No evidence was found of the <lb/>GLTP involvement in galactolipid transfer in plants but because of some similarities of <lb/>galactocerebroside to the glycosylglycerides, this hypothesis remains possible. <lb/>In plants, some PI-TPs are also present. SEC14 and AtSfh1, previously described, are some <lb/>examples. There are probably other PI-TP types although not yet known [62] (Table 2). <lb/>Finally, a SCP2 (Sterol Carrier Protein 2) was identified in Arabidopsis, transferring sterols as <lb/>well as phospholipids (Table 2). SCP2 is involved in the lipid transfer to the peroxysome for <lb/>the lipid catabolism [98]. <lb/>In plants, a large family of small soluble LTPs has been very well characterised genetically <lb/>and structurally [for reviews, see 99, 100]. The proteins transfer lipids in vitro between two <lb/>membranes and have no specificity for their lipid substrate. Sixty-seven genes were identified <lb/>in Arabidopsis (Table 2), among which most of them have a secretory peptide, indicating that <lb/>these proteins are excreted. The biological role of these proteins is unknown. They seem to be <lb/>involved in embryogenesis, cell wall formation and pathogen resistance [101]. <lb/> 6. Conclusion <lb/> Although requiring fatty acid delivery from the chloroplast, the plant ER is considered as a <lb/>lipid autonomous organelle because most of the phospholipid biosynthesis occurs there. The <lb/>nucleus and the Golgi are connected to the reticulum without any glycerolipid selection either <lb/>
			
			<page>25 <lb/></page>
			
			by membrane continuity or by dynamic vesicle exchanges. Vacuoles have vesicular <lb/>connection to the ER and the plasma membrane via the prevacuolar compartment but nothing <lb/>is known about the lipid delivery. More information is available concerning the lipids in the <lb/>plasma membrane. In particular, PS and a part of PE and PC are known to derive from the <lb/>Golgi by vesicular pathway. PI and part of PE and PC may come from the ER through PAM <lb/>and the plasma membrane DGDG, induced upon phosphate deprivation, could derive from <lb/>plastids either via direct contact with plastids possibly involving stromules, or via the ER. <lb/>Semi-autonomous organelles such as mitochondria and plastids are not connected to the ER <lb/>via vesicles. Lipid supply to mitochondria seems to occur exclusively through membrane <lb/>contact sites. Besides the DPG that is synthesised de novo in mitochondria, phospholipids are <lb/>transported from ER via MAM and, under phosphate deprivation, DGDG arrives through the <lb/>plastid envelope-mitochondria contact sites. Plastids are relatively independent for their lipid <lb/>synthesis due to the several lipid synthetic activities present in the envelope, but they need a <lb/>supply of a diacylglycerol source from the ER for formation of their eukaryotic glycerolipids. <lb/>This transfer is likely achieved via PLAM through a direct transfer of DAG molecules. <lb/>However phosphatidate derived from reticulum PC plays also some role in plastid envelope <lb/>galactolipid synthesis and the ABC protein TGD1 contributes to its transport to the inner <lb/>envelope membrane. Contact sites between the two envelope membranes may be involved in <lb/>the transfer since there is an intricate contribution of enzymatic activities of either the outer <lb/>envelope membrane or the inner envelope membrane (for instance, for the synthesis of <lb/>DGDG). In addition, plastids cannot achieve PC synthesis and need to import PC or LysoPC <lb/>from the ER. Inside chloroplasts, MGDG, DGDG, PG and sulfolipid are transferred from the <lb/>inner envelope membrane to the thylakoids by a vesicular transport that involves the VIPP1 <lb/>protein. <lb/>
			
			<page>26 <lb/></page>
			
			Altogether, the building of each type of membranes in plant cells requires an intricate <lb/>relationship between lipid synthesis and lipid transfer. Nothing is known whether the final <lb/>organisation of membranes is dependent or not on an original membrane pattern. Recent <lb/>progress concerns lipid transfers but the molecular mechanisms of the transfer are still very <lb/>elusive. Although some proteins have been identified, many candidates for lipid transfer <lb/>proteins remain to be identified. One expects that analysis of gene expression under <lb/>conditions such as phosphate deprivation which can affect lipid distribution should provide <lb/>new candidate proteins for these transfers and their regulation. Since all lipid trafficking <lb/>occurs in highly dynamic cells with mobile organelles, it is likely that cytoskeleton proteins <lb/>and molecular motors are essential and closely related to the transport. An important point <lb/>will be to understand how the lipid to be transferred are selected and when they are selected <lb/>related to the transfer. Organisation of lipid domains in membranes is likely to be important <lb/>but selection is expected to be also dependent on affinity of lipid transfer proteins for specific <lb/>lipids. Finally, dissection of these mechanisms of transfer will be an important challenge for <lb/>the future. <lb/>

			Figure 1: Lipid diffusion inside and across lipid bilayers. The figure shows the half-times <lb/>(T½) for spontaneous interbilayer and transbilayer movement according to [12, 16]. Large <lb/>arrows indicate fast movement and dashed arrows indicate slower movement. P: phosphate, <lb/>Chol: choline, Gal: galactose. <lb/> Figure 2: Lipid transfers towards and outwards the chloroplast envelope. PC is present in <lb/>the outer leaflet of the outer envelope membrane but is synthesized in the ER, not in the <lb/>plastid. It may be transferred from ER to the envelope directly or through its conversion to <lb/>LysoPC. The main lipids of thylakoids i.e. galactolipids, PG and SQDG are formed in the <lb/>envelope. Whereas prokaryotic type galactolipids are issued from phosphatidate (PA P ) <lb/>synthesized in the chloroplast, formation of eukaryotic type galactolipids is dependent on the <lb/>supply to the envelope of some PC derivatives formed in the ER: either diacylglycerol <lb/>(DAG E) [6] or phosphatidate (PA E ) [37]. PAP converting PA to DAG is present in the <lb/>envelope but only in the inner membrane. Altogether, a number of lipid transfers noted by <lb/>dashed arrows are important to build plastid membranes. Under phosphate deprivation, <lb/>DGDG formation is stimulated corresponding to activation or stimulation of a part of the <lb/>galactolipid synthesis pathway indicated in red [42; 6; 9]. Under these conditions, DGDG is <lb/>transferred through membrane contact between chloroplast and mitochondria [9]. <lb/> Figure 3: Scheme of the plant secretory pathway according to [48]. This scheme <lb/>represents different routes starting from the ER and indicates key proteins involved in vesicle <lb/>trafficking. Phosphorylated forms of PI address vesicles to specific compartments: PI-4P to <lb/>the storage vacuole, PI-3P to the lytic vacuole and PIP2 to the plasma membrane. 1-Transfer <lb/>from ER to Golgi uses COPII type vesicle machinery. Identified proteins involved in this <lb/>transfer are the GTPase Sar1, the GTP exchanging factor Sec12, the coat complexes Sec13 <lb/>and Sec23, and the GTPase RabD. 2-Transfer from Golgi to ER uses a COPI type vesicle <lb/>

			machinery. Identified proteins involved in this transfer are the GTPase Arf1, interacting with <lb/>a transmembrane protein p23, the GTP exchanging factor Gea, H/KDEL motif receptor <lb/>responsible of protein retrograde traffic ERD2. This transfer is actin dependent. 3-Transfer <lb/>from ER and Golgi to storage vacuole with the intervention of dense vesicles is not yet <lb/>characterised. The only protein identified in this transfer is the storage vacuole addressing <lb/>receptor PV72. 4-Transfer from Golgi to lytic vacuole via prevacuolar compartment uses <lb/>clathrin vesicle machinery. Identified proteins involved in vesicle formation are the GTPase <lb/>Arf1, lytic vacuole addressing motif receptor BP80 able to recruit the adaptatin complex AP1 <lb/>and thus clathrin. Vesicle fusion to prevacuolar compartment involves the v-SNARE PEP12 <lb/>and VAM3, the t-SNARE SYP25 and VTI11, and the GTPases RabA and RabF. This transfer <lb/>is actin and dynamin ADL6 dependent. 5-Transfer from Golgi to plasma membrane is not yet <lb/>identified. Protein involved in vesicle formation or fusion are not known. Only two PI-TP, <lb/>Sec14 and Sfh1, were characterised. This transfer is actin dependent. 6-Endocytosis uses <lb/>clathrin coated vesicle machinery. Identified proteins involved in vesicle formation are the <lb/>adaptatin complex AP2 and clathrin. This transfer is actin and dynamin ADL1 dependent. <lb/>And 7-Exocytosis utilizes a vesicle machinery not yet characterised. Identified proteins <lb/>involved in vesicle formation are the GTPase Arf1 and the GTP exchanging factor GNOM. <lb/>Vesicle fusion to plasma membrane involves the t-SNARE KNOLLE and the v-SNARE <lb/>SNAP33. <lb/> Figure 4: Lipid transfer at membrane contact sites. A: Electron microscopy observation of <lb/> A. thaliana cells grown in suspension. Cells were grown for 3 days in minus P i medium. Bar: <lb/>1 µm. Arrows indicate position of contact between mitochondria and amylochloroplasts. B: <lb/>Schematic representation of membrane contact sites reported in the plant cell. Reticulum <lb/>44 <lb/>forms a network that facilitates lipid transfer between organelles. Plastids create envelope <lb/>extension in the form of stromules or of myelinic structures, marked with a star. <lb/>
