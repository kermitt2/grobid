			<body>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn&apos;s disease <lb/>and ulcerative colitis, are idiopathic chronic intestinal inflam-<lb/>matory diseases, characterized by recurrent episodes of relapse <lb/>and remission of disease. The introduction of anti-tumor necro-<lb/>sis factor (anti-TNF) agents has greatly improved the treatment <lb/>outcomes for IBDs, enabling higher rates of clinical and endo-<lb/>scopic remission in patients who are refractory to conventional <lb/>therapies such as corticosteroids and thiopurines. 1,2 Despite <lb/>the proven therapeutic efficacy of anti-TNF agents, treatment <lb/>failures to those sometimes occur in the form of primary nonre-<lb/>sponse or secondary loss of response (LOR). <lb/>About 10% to 20% of IBD patients have been reported to be <lb/>unresponsive to induction treatment with anti-TNF agents. 3 The <lb/>mechanism of this primary nonresponse is unclear. Meanwhile, <lb/>of the patients who initially respond to anti-TNF treatment, a <lb/>significant proportion loses response over time with annual risk <lb/>of 13% to 24%. 4 Several distinct mechanisms for secondary <lb/>LOR have been suggested, including the formation of antidrug <lb/>antibodies (ADA), nonimmune drug clearance, relentless TNF-<lb/>mediated flare consuming the anti-TNF agent, shift of disease <lb/>pathway away from TNF, as well as non-IBD related mecha-<lb/>nisms such as irritable bowel syndrome, infection, cancer, and <lb/>so forth. 5 To prevent LOR to anti-TNF treatment, scheduled <lb/>treatment rather than episodic therapy and combination therapy <lb/>with immunomodulators than anti-TNF monotherapy are rec-<lb/>ommended. 6 <lb/>In patients presenting with LOR to anti-TNF agents, after ex-<lb/>cluding non-IBD, noninflammatory causes, several therapeutic <lb/>options such as dose intensification, switching to another anti-<lb/>TNF agents, and switching to another biologics with different <lb/>mechanism of action would be considered. In these circum-<lb/>stances, pharmacokinetic measurements of anti-TNF trough <lb/>levels (TL) and ADA could be useful to elucidate mechanisms of <lb/>LOR and guide selection of most appropriate therapeutic strat-<lb/>egy. 3 <lb/>Several studies have demonstrated clinical importance of <lb/>therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of anti-TNF agents by de-<lb/>termining drug levels and ADA in terms of a tailored approach <lb/>to IBD patients. Higher anti-TNF TLs have been associated with <lb/>better clinical outcomes and endoscopic improvement, while <lb/>undetectable anti-TNF TLs were related to loss of clinical re-<lb/>sponse and higher risk for surgery. On the contrary, immuno-<lb/>genicity (formation of ADA) has been known to accelerate anti-<lb/>TNF clearance and increase the risk of infusion reaction to anti-<lb/>TNF agents, although the exact clinical impact of ADA on anti-<lb/>TNF efficacy is still controversial. 7 In Western countries, clinical <lb/>decision algorithms with TDM based on drug levels and ADA <lb/>for the management of IBD patients with LOR, to optimize the <lb/>efficacy of anti-TNF and then to reduce health-related cost, has <lb/>been proposed and widely performed in clinical practice. 8 In <lb/>addition, some researchers have suggested that proactive TDM <lb/>will be promising even for IBD patients in clinical remission, to <lb/>maintain optimal anti-TNF concentrations and then to reduce <lb/>costs and risk for adverse events. 7 <lb/>However, most of these studies have been performed in West-<lb/>ern countries. To date, there has been no data regarding TDM <lb/>and its impact on clinical outcomes and medical costs in Korean <lb/>IBD patients with secondary LOR. And, measurements of drug <lb/>levels and ADA are not yet available in Korea. <lb/>In this issue of Gut and Liver, Choi et al. 9 investigated the <lb/></body>

			<body>clinical usefulness of infliximab (IFX) TLs and ADA in 39 pe-<lb/>diatric IBD patients in a retrospective manner and proposed a <lb/>tailored therapeutic strategy for IFX therapy based on IFX TLs <lb/>and ADA status in patients with LOR. They compared serum <lb/>IFX TLs and ADA between 16 patients with clinical remission <lb/>and 23 patients with a poor response to IFX treatment and re-<lb/>measured the IFX TLs and ADA after IFX dose intensification <lb/>in 21 patients with LOR. The authors showed that the IFX TLs <lb/>were significantly higher in patients with clinical remission than <lb/>those with a poor response (median, 3.99 μg/mL vs 0.88 μg/mL; <lb/>p=0.002) and the ADA was detectable in only patients with LOR <lb/>(7/23, 30.4%). In addition, after IFX dose intensification in pa-<lb/>tients with LOR, the IFX TLs were increased in 17 patients with <lb/>improved response, while four patients with no response have <lb/>no detectable IFX but detectable ADA. This study, firstly evalu-<lb/>ated the efficacy of anti-TNF TLs and ADA in Korean IBD pa-<lb/>tients, provide a valuable clinical insight into the TDM of anti-<lb/>TNF agents for IBD patients with secondary LOR in Korea. <lb/>However, as the authors described, this study performed <lb/>retrospectively with a small sample size and did not evaluate <lb/>clinical outcomes and response to dose intensification of IFX in <lb/>the long-term. To validate the results of this study, especially <lb/>in adult patients, a prospective multicenter long-term clini-<lb/>cal trial with a larger sample size in Korean IBD patients with <lb/>anti-TNF treatments should be conducted. One of these would <lb/>undoubtedly be the OACIS study from KASID (Korean associa-<lb/>tion for the study of intestinal diseases), a prospective, open-<lb/>label, multicenter trial for the occurrence of ADA and change <lb/>of drug level after anti-TNF therapy and their impact on clinical <lb/>outcomes in moderate to severe IBD. <lb/></body>
