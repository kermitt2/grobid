			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Pleiotropy refers to the well established notion that a single gene or genetic variant <lb/>affects multiple distinct traits (Paaby and Rockman 2013) , and the discovery of pleiotropic <lb/>genes can provide meaningful insights into the molecular mechanisms of these traits (Tyler, <lb/>Crawford, and Pendergrass 2016) . It has become easier to identify pleiotropic genes with the <lb/>advent of reverse-genetic screens and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping (Paaby and <lb/>Rockman 2013) . For example, pleiotropic QTL for diverse growth and fitness traits have been <lb/>identified in organisms such as yeast (Peltier et al. 2019; Jerison et al. 2017; Cubillos et al. <lb/>2011) , Arabidopsis (Fusari et al. 2017; McKay, Richards, and Mitchell-Olds 2003; El-Assal et al. <lb/>2004) , Drosophila (McGuigan et al. 2014; Brown et al. 2013) , and mice (White et al. 2013; <lb/>Leamy et al. 2014; Lin et al. 2014) . These studies have led to important questions in the field of <lb/>evolutionary genetics regarding the &apos;cost of complexity&apos; (Fisher, n.d.; Orr 2000) , as a single <lb/>mutation might be beneficial for one trait and harmful for another (Wagner and Zhang 2011) . <lb/>Furthermore, human association studies have identified pleiotropic variants associated with <lb/>different diseases (Sivakumaran et al. 2011; Chesmore, Bartlett, and Williams 2018; Pavlides et <lb/>al. 2016) , highlighting both the ubiquity and importance of certain immune-related genes and <lb/>oncogenes across unrelated diseases (Gratten and Visscher 2016; Borrello, Degl&apos;Innocenti, and <lb/>Pierotti 2008) . Perhaps the strongest evidence of pleiotropy exists for molecular phenotypes. <lb/>Large-scale expression QTL (eQTL) mapping studies have identified single regulatory variants <lb/>that control expression and likely the functions of hundreds of genes at once, opening a window <lb/>into the mechanisms for how traits are controlled (Rockman, Skrovanek, and Kruglyak 2010; <lb/>Breitling et al. 2008; Hasin-Brumshtein et al. 2016; Keurentjes et al. 2007; Frank Wolfgang <lb/>Albert et al. 2018; Frank W. Albert and Kruglyak 2015) . <lb/>The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans provides a tractable metazoan model to identify <lb/>and study pleiotropic QTL (Paaby and Rockman 2013) . A large panel of recombinant inbred <lb/>advanced intercross lines (RIAILs) derived from two divergent strains, N2 and CB4856 <lb/>(Rockman and Kruglyak 2009; Andersen et al. 2015) , has been leveraged in several linkage <lb/>mapping analyses (McGrath et al. 2009; Bendesky and Bargmann 2011; Lee et al. 2017; Singh <lb/>et al. 2016; Zdraljevic et al. 2019; Brady et al. 2019; Zdraljevic et al. 2017; Evans et al. 2018; <lb/>Andersen et al. 2014; Viñuela et al. 2010; Doroszuk et al. 2009; Snoek et al. 2014; Rodriguez et <lb/>al. 2012; Glater, Rockman, and Bargmann 2014; Rockman, Skrovanek, and Kruglyak 2010; <lb/>Zamanian et al. 2018a; Bendesky et al. 2011, 2012; Schmid et al. 2015; Balla et al. 2015; <lb/>Kammenga et al. 2007; Gutteling, Riksen, et al. 2007; Gutteling, Doroszuk, et al. 2007; Li et al. <lb/>2006; Reddy et al. 2009; Seidel et al. 2011; Seidel, Rockman, and Kruglyak 2008) . Quantitative <lb/>genetic analysis using these panels and a high-throughput phenotyping assay (Andersen et al. <lb/>2015) has facilitated the discovery of numerous QTL (Zamanian et al. 2018b) , several <lb/>quantitative trait genes (QTG) (Brady et al. 2019) and quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) <lb/>(Zdraljevic et al. 2019, 2017) underlying fitness-related traits in the nematode. Additionally, three <lb/>pleiotropic genomic regions were recently found to influence responses to a diverse group of <lb/>toxins (Evans et al. 2018) . However, overlapping genomic regions might not represent true <lb/>pleiotropy but could demonstrate the co-existence of tightly linked loci (Paaby and Rockman <lb/>2013) . <lb/></body>

			<body>Here, we use linkage mapping to identify a single overlapping QTL on chromosome V <lb/>that influences the responses to eight chemotherapeutic compounds. We show that these <lb/>drug-response QTL also overlap with an expression QTL hotspot that contains the gene scb-1 , <lb/>previously implicated in bleomycin response (Brady et al. 2019) . Although the exact mechanism <lb/>of scb-1 is yet unknown, it is hypothesized to act in response to stress (Riedel et al. 2013) and <lb/>has weak homology to a viral hydrolase (Zhang et al. 2018; Kelley et al. 2015) . Together, these <lb/>data suggest that the importance of scb-1 expression might extend beyond bleomycin response. <lb/>We validated the QTL using near-isogenic lines (NILs) and performed mediation analysis to <lb/>predict that scb-1 expression explains the observed QTL for five of the eight drugs. Finally, we <lb/>directly tested the effect of scb-1 loss of function on chemotherapeutic responses. We <lb/>discovered that expression of scb-1 underlies differential responses to several <lb/>chemotherapeutics that cause double-strand DNA breaks, not just bleomycin. This discovery of <lb/>pleiotropy helps to further define the role of scb-1 by expanding its known functions and <lb/>provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the nematode drug response. <lb/>MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>Strains <lb/>Animals were grown at 20°C on modified nematode growth media (NGMA) containing <lb/>1% agar and 0.7% agarose to prevent burrowing and fed OP50 (Ghosh et al. 2012) . The two <lb/>parental strains, the canonical laboratory strain, N2, and the wild isolate from Hawaii, CB4856, <lb/>were used to generate all recombinant lines. 208 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines <lb/>(RIAILs) generated previously by Rockman et al. (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009) (set 1 RIAILs) <lb/>were phenotyped for expression QTL mapping (detailed below). A second set of 296 RIAILs <lb/>generated previously by Andersen et al. (Andersen et al. 2015) (set 2 RIAILs) was used more <lb/>extensively for drug phenotyping and linkage mapping. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) were <lb/>generated by backcrossing a selected RIAIL for several generations (Brady et al. 2019) , using <lb/>PCR amplicons for insertion-deletion (indels) variants to track the introgressed region. NILs <lb/>were whole-genome sequenced to verify clean introgressions. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated <lb/>deletions of scb-1 were described in Brady et al. (Brady et al. 2019) . All strains are available <lb/>upon request or from the C. elegans Natural Diversity Resource (Cook et al. 2016) . <lb/>High-throughput fitness assays for linkage mapping <lb/>For dose responses and RIAIL phenotyping, we used a high-throughput fitness assay <lb/>(HTA) described previously (Andersen et al. 2015) . In summary, populations of each strain were <lb/>passaged and amplified on NGMA plates for four generations. In the fifth generation, gravid <lb/>adults were bleach-synchronized and 25-50 embryos from each strain were aliquoted into <lb/>96-well microtiter plates at a final volume of 50 µL K medium (Boyd, Smith, and Freedman <lb/>2012) . The following day, arrested L1s were fed HB101 bacterial lysate (Pennsylvania State <lb/>University Shared Fermentation Facility, State College, PA; (García-González et al. 2017) ) at a <lb/>final concentration of 5 mg/mL in K medium and were grown to the L4 larval stage for 48 hours <lb/>at 20°C with constant shaking. Three L4 larvae were sorted into new 96-well microtiter plates <lb/>containing 10 mg/mL HB101 bacterial lysate, 50 µM kanamycin, and either diluent (1% water or <lb/></body>

			<body>1% DMSO) or drug dissolved in the diluent using a large-particle flow cytometer (COPAS <lb/>BIOSORT, Union Biometrica; Holliston, MA). Sorted animals were grown for 96 hours at 20°C <lb/>with constant shaking. The next generation of animals and the parents were treated with sodium <lb/>azide (50 mM in 1X M9) to straighten their bodies for more accurate length measurements. <lb/>Animal length (median.TOF), optical density (median.norm.EXT), and brood size (norm.n) were <lb/>quantified for each well using the COPAS BIOSORT. Phenotypic measurements collected by the <lb/>BIOSORT were processed and analyzed using the R package easysorter (Shimko and <lb/>Andersen 2014) as described previously (Brady et al. 2019) . <lb/>Dose-response assays <lb/>Four genetically divergent strains (N2, CB4856, JU258, and DL238) were treated with <lb/>increasing concentrations of each of the eight drugs using the HTA described above. The dose <lb/>of each drug that provided a reproducible drug-specific effect that maximizes between-strain <lb/>variation while minimizing within-strain variation across the three traits was selected for the <lb/>linkage mapping experiments. The chosen concentrations are as follows: 100 µM amsacrine <lb/>hydrochloride (Fisher Scientific, #A277720MG) in DMSO, 50 µM bleomycin sulfate (Fisher, <lb/>#50-148-546) in water, 2 µM bortezomib (VWR, #AAJ60378-MA) in DMSO, 250 µM carmustine <lb/>(Sigma, #1096724-75MG) in DMSO, 500 µM cisplatin (Sigma, #479306-1G) in K media, 500 µM <lb/>etoposide (Sigma, #E1383) in DMSO, 500 µM puromycin dihydrochloride (VWR, #62111-170) in <lb/>water, and 150 µM silver nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich, #S6506-5G) in water. <lb/>Linkage mapping <lb/>Set 1 and set 2 RIAILs were phenotyped in each of the eight drugs and controls using <lb/>the HTA described above. Linkage mapping was performed on each of the drug and gene <lb/>expression <lb/>traits <lb/>using <lb/>the <lb/>R <lb/>package <lb/>linkagemapping <lb/>( https://github.com/AndersenLab/linkagemapping ) as described previously (Brady et al. 2019) . <lb/>The cross object derived from the whole-genome sequencing of the RIAILs containing 13,003 <lb/>SNPs was loaded using the function load_cross_obj(&quot;N2xCB4856cross_full&quot;) . The RIAIL <lb/>phenotypes were merged into the cross object using the merge_pheno function with the <lb/>argument set = 1 for expression QTL mapping and set = 2 for drug phenotype mapping. A <lb/>forward search ( fsearch function) adapted from the R/qtl package (Broman et al. 2003) was <lb/>used to calculate the logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for each genetic marker and each trait <lb/>as -n(ln(1-R 2 )/2ln(10)) where R is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the RIAIL <lb/>genotypes at the marker and trait phenotypes (Bloom et al. 2013) . A 5% genome-wide error rate <lb/>was calculated by permuting the RIAIL phenotypes 1000 times. The marker with the highest <lb/>LOD score above the significance threshold was selected as the QTL then integrated into the <lb/>model as a cofactor and mapping was repeated iteratively until no further significant QTL were <lb/>identified. Finally, the annotate_lods function was used to calculate the effect size of each QTL <lb/>and determine 95% confidence intervals defined by a 1.5 LOD drop from the peak marker using <lb/>the argument cutoff = proximal . <lb/></body>

			<body>Modified HTA for NIL validation <lb/>NILs and scb-1 deletion strains were tested using a modified version of the HTA detailed <lb/>above. Strains were propagated for two generations, bleach-synchronized in three independent <lb/>replicates, and titered at a concentration of 25-50 embryos per well of a 96-well microtiter plate. <lb/>The following day, arrested L1s were fed HB101 bacterial lysate at a final concentration of 5 <lb/>mg/mL with either diluent or drug. After 48 hours of growth at 20°C with constant shaking, <lb/>nematodes were treated with sodium azide (5 mM in water) prior to analysis of animal length <lb/>and optical density using the COPAS BIOSORT. As only one generation of growth is observed, <lb/>brood size was not calculated. A single trait (median.EXT) was chosen to represent animal <lb/>growth generally, as the trait is defined by optical density over length. Because of the modified <lb/>timing of the drug delivery, lower drug concentrations were needed to see the previous effect. <lb/>The selected doses are as follows: 12.5 µM amsacrine in DMSO, 12.5 µM bleomycin in water, 2 <lb/>µM bortezomib in DMSO, 250 µM carmustine in DMSO, 125 µM cisplatin in K media, 62.5 µM <lb/>etoposide in DMSO, 300 µM puromycin in water, and 100 µM silver in water. <lb/>Expression QTL analysis <lb/>Microarray data for gene expression using 15,888 probes were previously collected from <lb/>synchronized young adult populations of 209 set 1 RIAILs (Rockman, Skrovanek, and Kruglyak <lb/>2010) . Expression data were corrected for dye effects and probes with variants were removed <lb/>(Andersen et al. 2014) . Linkage mapping was performed as described above for the remaining <lb/>14,107 probes, and a significance threshold was determined using a permutation-based False <lb/>Discovery Rate (FDR). FDR was calculated as the ratio of the average number of genes across <lb/>10 permutations expected by chance to show a maximum LOD score greater than a particular <lb/>threshold vs. the number of genes observed in the real data with a maximum LOD score greater <lb/>than that threshold. We calculated the FDR for a range of thresholds from 2 to 10, with <lb/>increasing steps of 0.01, and set the threshold so that the calculated FDR was less than 5%. <lb/>Local eQTL were defined as linkages whose peak LOD scores were within 1 Mb of the <lb/>starting position of the probe (Rockman, Skrovanek, and Kruglyak 2010) . eQTL hotspots were <lb/>identified by dividing the genome into 5 cM bins and counting the number of distant eQTL that <lb/>mapped to each bin. Significance was determined as bins with more eQTL than the <lb/>Bonferroni-corrected 99 th percentile of a Poisson distribution with a mean of 3.91 QTL (total QTL <lb/>/ total bins) (Brem et al. 2002; Evans et al. 2018; Rockman, Skrovanek, and Kruglyak 2010) . <lb/>Mediation analysis <lb/>A total of 159 set 1 RIAILs were phenotyped in each of the eight drugs and controls <lb/>using the HTA described above. Mediation scores were calculated with bootstrapping using the <lb/>mediate function from the mediation R package (version 4.4.7) (Tingley et al. 2014) for each <lb/>QTL identified from the set 2 RIAILs and all 49 probes (including scb-1, A_12_P104350) within <lb/>the chromosome V eQTL hotspot using the following models: <lb/>(1) Mediator model: lm(expression ~ genotype) <lb/>(2) Outcome model: lm(phenotype ~ expression + genotype) <lb/></body>

	        <body>The output of the mediate function can be summarized as follows: the total effect of <lb/>genotype on phenotype, ignoring expression ( tau.coef ); the direct effect of genotype on <lb/>phenotype, while holding expression constant ( z0 ); the estimated effect of expression on <lb/>phenotype ( d0 ); the proportion of the total effect that can be explained by expression data ( n0 ) <lb/>The final mediation score is determined as the proportion of the total QTL effect that can be <lb/>attributed to gene expression ( n0 ).

			<body>amsacrine, and cisplatin) are known to cause double-strand DNA breaks and/or inhibit DNA <lb/>synthesis (Dorr 1992; Dasari and Tchounwou 2014; Montecucco, Zanetta, and Biamonti 2015; <lb/>Ketron et al. 2012; Nikolova et al. 2017) . The remaining three compounds either inhibit protein <lb/>synthesis (puromycin) (Azzam and Algranati 1973) , inhibit the proteosome and subsequent <lb/>protein degradation (bortezomib) (Piperdi et al. 2011) , or cause cellular toxicity in a poorly <lb/>defined way (silver nitrate) (Kaplan, Akalin Ciftci, and Kutlu 2016) ( Table 1 ). In the presence of <lb/>each drug, nematodes were generally shorter, less optically dense, and produced smaller <lb/>broods compared to non-treated nematodes ( Figure S1, File S1 ). We observed significant <lb/>phenotypic variation among strains and identified a substantial heritable genetic component for <lb/>most traits (average H 2 = 0.51 +/-0.24). <lb/>We exposed a panel of 296 RIAILs (set 2 RIAILs, see Methods) to all eight <lb/>chemotherapeutics at a selected concentration that both maximizes among-strain and <lb/>minimizes within-strain phenotypic variation ( File S2 ). Linkage mapping for all three traits for <lb/>each of the eight drugs (total of 24 traits) identified 56 QTL from 23 traits (one trait had no <lb/>significant QTL), several of which have been identified previously (Brady et al. 2019; Evans et <lb/>al. 2018; Zdraljevic et al. 2017) ( File S3, Figure S2 ). Strikingly, a QTL on the center of <lb/>chromosome V was linked to variation in responses to all eight compounds ( Figure 1 ). In all <lb/>cases, the CB4856 allele on chromosome V is associated with greater resistance to the drug <lb/>than the N2 allele ( Figure S2, File S2, File S3 ). We previously identified this genomic interval <lb/>as a QTL hotspot, defined as a region heavily enriched for toxin-response QTL (Evans et al. <lb/>2018) . Because several of the chemotherapeutics share a similar mechanism of action, a single <lb/>pleiotropic gene might underlie the observed QTL for multiple drugs. <lb/>In order to isolate and validate the effect of this QTL, we constructed reciprocal <lb/>near-isogenic lines (NILs) by introgressing a genomic region on chromosome V from the <lb/>resistant CB4856 strain into the sensitive N2 background and vice versa ( File S4 ). We used a <lb/>modified high-throughput assay (see Methods) to measure length and optical density of a <lb/>population of animals grown in the presence of the drug for 48 hours (from larval stages L1 to <lb/>L4). In this modified assay, less drug was required to observe the same phenotypic effect as <lb/>before and a single trait (median.EXT) that combines both optical density and length serves as <lb/>a proxy for the complexity of animal growth ( Figure S3, File S5 ). For all eight <lb/>chemotherapeutics tested, the strain with the N2 introgression was significantly more sensitive <lb/>than its CB4856 parent and/or the strain with the CB4856 introgression was significantly more <lb/>resistant than its N2 parent ( Figure 2, File S5, File S6 ). These data confirm that one or more <lb/>genetic variant(s) within this region on chromosome V cause increased drug sensitivities in N2. <lb/>Expression QTL mapping identifies a hotspot on the center of chromosome V <lb/>Genetic variation can affect a phenotype most commonly through either modifications of <lb/>the amino acid sequence that lead to altered protein function (or even loss of function) or <lb/>changes in the expression level of the protein. In the latter case, measuring the intermediate <lb/>phenotype (gene expression) can be useful in elucidating the mechanism by which genetic <lb/>variation causes phenotypic variation. More specifically, cases with overlap between expression <lb/>QTL (eQTL) and drug-response QTL suggest that a common variant could underlie both traits <lb/></body>

Expression of 15,888 <lb/>probes were previously measured using microarrays for a panel of 208 RIAILs (set 1 RIAILs, <lb/>see Methods) between N2 and CB4856 (Rockman and Kruglyak 2009) ( File S7 ). The variation <lb/>in gene expression was used as a phenotypic trait to identify eQTL using linkage mapping with <lb/>1,455 variants (Rockman, Skrovanek, and Kruglyak 2010) . Rockman et al. identified 2,309 <lb/>eQTL and three regions with significantly clustered distant eQTL (eQTL hotspots), suggesting <lb/>that these regions are pleiotropic, wherein one or more variant(s) are affecting expression of <lb/>multiple genes. We performed whole-genome sequencing for these strains and identified 13,003 <lb/>informative variants (Brady et al. 2019) . Linkage mapping with these variants for the 14,107 <lb/>probes without genetic variation in CB4856 (Andersen et al. 2014) identified 2,540 eQTL <lb/>associated with variation in expression of 2,196 genes ( Figure 3A, File S8 ). These eQTL have <lb/>relatively large effect sizes compared to the drug-response QTL. On average, each eQTL <lb/>explains 23% of the phenotypic variance in gene expression among the RIAIL population. Half <lb/>of the eQTL (50.2%; 1,276) mapped within 1 Mb of the gene whose expression was measured <lb/>and were classified as local (see Methods). The other half (49.7%; 1,264) were found distant <lb/>from their respective gene, and over a third (37%; 940) were found on different chromosomes <lb/>entirely. In general, eQTL effect sizes increased, max LOD scores decreased, and confidence <lb/>intervals become smaller compared to the original mapping results ( File S8 ). These differences <lb/>and the additional eQTL observed between this analysis and the original are likely due to the <lb/>integration of new genetic markers. <lb/>In total, we identified nine eQTL hotspots ( Figure 3B, File S9 ). Three of which were <lb/>previously identified on chromosome IV and X (Rockman, Skrovanek, and Kruglyak 2010) . <lb/>Notably, three of the eQTL hotspots overlap with the previously identified drug-response QTL <lb/>hotspots on chromosomes IV and V (Evans et al. 2018) . The overlap of these eQTL and <lb/>drug-response QTL hotspots could provide strong candidate genes whose expression underlies <lb/>the differences in nematode drug responses generally. Expression of one gene of interest, <lb/>scb-1 , has been previously implicated in response to bleomycin (Brady et al. 2019) and resides <lb/>within the eQTL hotspot region on chromosome V ( File S9 ). Together with the putative role for <lb/>scb-1 as a hydrolase (Zhang et al. 2018; Kelley et al. 2015; Brady et al. 2019) , these data <lb/>suggest that variation in expression of scb-1 and responses to these eight chemotherapeutics <lb/>(including bleomycin) could be mechanistically linked. <lb/>Mediation analysis suggests scb-1 expression plays a role in responses to several <lb/>chemotherapeutics <lb/>Mediation analysis seeks to explain the relationship between an independent and <lb/>dependent variable by including a third (non-observable) intermediary variable. We can use <lb/>mediation analysis to understand how certain genetic variants on chromosome V (independent <lb/>variable) affect drug responses (dependent variable) through differential gene expression of <lb/>genes within the eQTL hotspot (mediator variable) ( Figure S4 ). We measured brood size, <lb/>animal length, and optical density in response to all eight chemotherapeutics in the set 1 RIAILs <lb/></body>

			<body>and performed linkage mapping for these traits ( File S2, File S10, Figure S5 ). Although the <lb/>power to detect QTL with these strains is lower than in our original mapping set (set 2 RIAILs) <lb/>(Andersen et al. 2015) , we still identified overlapping QTL on chromosome V for half of the <lb/>drugs tested (bleomycin, cisplatin, silver, and amsacrine) ( Figure S5 ). We also detected <lb/>putative small-effect QTL just below the permutation-based threshold for at least one other <lb/>chemotherapeutic ( File S10 ). <lb/>We calculated the proportion of QTL effects that can be explained by variation in <lb/>expression of scb-1 compared to the other 48 genes in the chromosome V eQTL hotspot using <lb/>mediation analysis (see Methods). We estimated that expression of scb-1 mediates 61.3% of <lb/>the chromosome V QTL for bleomycin response ( Figure 4, File S11 ). Moreover, out of all 49 <lb/>genes in the region, scb-1 was a clear mediation score outlier, falling in the 99 th percentile of all <lb/>local genes. Of the remaining seven chemotherapeutics, we showed that amsacrine, cisplatin, <lb/>etoposide, and puromycin all showed moderate evidence of scb-1 mediation, with scb-1 falling <lb/>near or above the 95 th percentile of mediation estimates for all local genes ( Figure 4, File S11 ). <lb/>In fact, scb-1 was the only gene with a significant mediation estimate within the drug-response <lb/>QTL confidence interval for cisplatin. The opposite result was seen for bortezomib, carmustine, <lb/>and silver, in which all showed strong evidence against scb-1 mediation ( Figure 4, File S11 ). <lb/>This in silico approach indicated that expression of scb-1 might be an intermediate link between <lb/>genetic variation on chromosome V and responses to five of the eight chemotherapeutic drugs <lb/>tested. <lb/>Expression of scb-1 mediates responses to several chemotherapeutics that cause <lb/>double-strand DNA breaks <lb/>To empirically test whether scb-1 expression modulates the chromosome V QTL effect <lb/>for each drug, we exposed two independently derived strains with scb-1 deletions (Brady et al. <lb/>2019) to each chemotherapeutic ( Figure 5, Figure S6, File S6, File S12 ). Because RIAILs with <lb/>the CB4856 allele on chromosome V express higher levels of scb-1 than RIAILs with the N2 <lb/>allele ( File S7, File S8 ), we expect that loss of scb-1 will cause increased drug sensitivity in the <lb/>CB4856 background but might not have an effect in the N2 background. We validated the <lb/>results of Brady et al. and confirmed that ablated scb-1 expression causes robust sensitivity to <lb/>bleomycin in both N2 and CB4856 ( Figure 5, Figure S6, File S6, File S12 ). We also observed <lb/>similarly increased sensitivity to cisplatin with scb-1 deletions in both backgrounds. Furthermore, <lb/>removing scb-1 shows moderately increased sensitivity in the CB4856 background for <lb/>amsacrine and in the N2 background for carmustine. The remaining four drugs did not show a <lb/>significantly different phenotype between the parental N2 and CB4856 strains, suggesting these <lb/>traits might be less reproducible or that scb-1 variation does not underlie these drug differences. <lb/>Overall, these results provide evidence for the pleiotropic effect of scb-1 , which appears to <lb/>mediate responses to four different drugs. <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>In this study, we identified overlapping QTL on the center of chromosome V that <lb/>influence sensitivities to eight chemotherapeutic drugs. Because five of these drugs are known <lb/></body>

			<body>to cause double-strand DNA breaks, we hypothesized that this genomic region might be <lb/>pleiotropic -a single shared genetic variant affects the responses to each drug. Because this <lb/>variant might affect drug responses by regulating gene expression levels, we looked for the <lb/>co-existence of drug-response QTL and expression QTL on chromosome V. We identified 2,540 <lb/>eQTL and nine eQTL hotspots, including a region on the center of chromosome V. We <lb/>calculated the mediation effect of all 49 genes with an eQTL that maps to this hotspot region <lb/>and identified scb-1 as a candidate gene whose expression influences the responses to several <lb/>chemotherapeutics. We used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated scb-1 deletion strains to empirically <lb/>validate the role of scb-1 in the chemotherapeutic response. In addition to bleomycin (Brady et <lb/>al. 2019) , we discovered that responses to cisplatin, amsacrine, and carmustine are mediated <lb/>by scb-1 expression. In this study, we found evidence that overlapping QTL are representative <lb/>of pleiotropy at the gene level and further elucidated the function of scb-1 as a potential <lb/>response to double-strand DNA break stress. <lb/>Mediation of drug-response QTL using gene expression to identify causal genes <lb/>Mediation analysis often suggests potential candidate genes that underlie different traits <lb/>(Huang et al. 2015; Sasaki, Frommlet, and Nordborg 2018) and could be applied to drug <lb/>responses. Using C. elegans strains and high-throughput assays, we can rapidly validate <lb/>hypotheses generated by mediation analysis. Three of the eight chemotherapeutics that map to <lb/>an overlapping drug-response QTL and were potentially mediated by scb-1 were validated using <lb/>targeted deletion strains. <lb/>Although mediation analysis provided moderate evidence that expression of scb-1 may <lb/>also play a role in sensitivity to etoposide and puromycin, we observed no experimental <lb/>evidence of this relationship. Additionally, we have evidence that expression of scb-1 might <lb/>mediate response to carmustine. However, mediation analysis disagrees. The discrepancy <lb/>between the mediation analysis and validation of causality using targeted deletion strains could <lb/>be partially explained by one of several possibilities. First, different traits were measured in each <lb/>experiment. The mediation analysis used traits measured over 96 hours of growth in drug <lb/>conditions spanning two generations, but the causality test used traits measured over 48 hours <lb/>of growth in drug conditions within one generation. Second, the precision of our mediation <lb/>estimates was likely reduced by the poor quality drug traits for the set 1 RIAIL panel (Andersen <lb/>et al. 2015) . Indeed, bortezomib, carmustine, etoposide, and puromycin did not map to the <lb/>center of chromosome V using the set 1 RIAILs ( Figure S5 ). Expression data for the set 2 RIAIL <lb/>panel would likely generate more accurate mediation estimates, especially if data were collected <lb/>using RNA sequencing to avoid the inherent reference bias of microarray data (Zhao et al. <lb/>2014) . Third, our mediation analysis was performed using expression data collected in control <lb/>conditions and phenotype data collected in drug conditions. This analysis will only provide <lb/>evidence of mediation if the baseline expression differences affect an individual&apos;s response to <lb/>the drug. Collecting expression data from drug-treated nematodes could help us learn more <lb/>about how gene expression varies in response to treatment with the chemotherapeutic. Finally, <lb/>as we only directly assessed the complete loss of scb-1 in drug sensitivity, it is still possible that <lb/>reduction of function (or change in function) due to a single nucleotide variant or other structural <lb/>variation in CB4856 could validate the role of scb-1 in responses to these drugs. <lb/></body>

			<body>This study demonstrates the power of pairing genome-wide gene expression data with <lb/>QTL mappings for other traits using simple colocalization as well as more complex mediation <lb/>analysis techniques. In addition to providing a resource for candidate gene prioritization within a <lb/>QTL interval, mediation analysis can help to identify the mechanism by which genetic variation <lb/>causes phenotypic differences. This type of approach could be even more powerful using <lb/>genome-wide association (GWA) where the decreased linkage disequilibrium between variants <lb/>generates smaller genomic confidence intervals. Smaller intervals have fewer spurious <lb/>overlapping eQTL, which could help to narrow the list of candidate genes. Although mediation <lb/>analysis is only effective if a change in expression is observed and might not be useful for <lb/>identifying effects from protein-coding variation, many current studies show that the majority of <lb/>genetic variants associated with complex traits lie in regulatory regions (Hindorff et al. 2009) . <lb/>Whole-genome expression analysis could provide the missing link to the identification of causal <lb/>genes underlying complex traits. <lb/>New evidence for the pleiotropic function of scb-1 <lb/>We identified eight chemotherapeutics with a QTL that mapped to a genomic region <lb/>defined as a QTL hotspot on the center of chromosome V (Evans et al. 2018) . Multiple genes in <lb/>close proximity, each regulating an aspect of cellular growth and fitness, might underlie each <lb/>independently. Alternatively, genetic variation within a single gene might regulate <lb/>responses to multiple (or all) of the eight drugs tested if the mechanisms of action were shared <lb/>( e.g. repair of double-strand DNA breaks). Expression of scb-1 , a gene previously implicated in <lb/>modulating the nematode&apos;s response to bleomycin, was found to reduce sensitivity to half of the <lb/>drugs tested. This pleiotropic effect of scb-1 provides new evidence for the function of the gene <lb/>and possible molecular mechanisms underlying nematode drug responses. It is hypothesized <lb/>that SCB-1 might function as a hydrolase that breaks down compounds like bleomycin (Brady et <lb/>al. 2019) or plays a role in the nematode stress response (Riedel et al. 2013) . Both hypotheses <lb/>are consistent with our data, explaining why nematodes with low expression of scb-1 are highly <lb/>sensitive to the compound. Furthermore, all four of these chemotherapeutics, whose responses <lb/>are mediated by expression of scb-1 , are known to cause double-strand DNA breaks (Dorr <lb/>1992; Dasari and Tchounwou 2014; Ketron et al. 2012; Nikolova et al. 2017) . Although the <lb/>results for bortezomib, puromycin, and silver were inconclusive, we found no clear evidence that <lb/>expression of scb-1 dictates their responses. Together, these data suggest a potential role for <lb/>scb-1 specifically in response to stress induced by double-strand DNA breaks. However, the <lb/>lack of sensitivity in etoposide, which also causes double-strand DNA breaks (Montecucco, <lb/>Zanetta, and Biamonti 2015) , indicates that this response might be more complex. <lb/>The exact variant that causes the differential expression of scb-1 is still unknown. <lb/>Importantly, scb-1 lies within an eQTL hotspot region where it is hypothesized that genetic <lb/>variation at a single locus might regulate expression of the 49 nearby genes. It is possible that <lb/>the same causal variant that regulates expression of scb-1 could also underlie the QTL for the <lb/>remaining four chemotherapeutics through differential expression of other nearby essential <lb/>genes. For example, mediation analysis for both bortezomib and etoposide indicated that <lb/>expression variation of a dehydrogenase ( D1054.8 ) may underlie their differential responses <lb/></body>
