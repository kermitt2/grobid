			<front>Abstract <lb/>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by <lb/>adaptive and innate immune system dysregulation. Recent work has revealed moderate <lb/>alteration of gut microbial communities in subjects with MS and in experimental, induced <lb/>models. However, a mechanistic understanding linking the observed changes in the microbiota <lb/>and the presence of the disease is still missing. Chloroform-resistant, spore-forming bacteria <lb/>have been shown to exhibit immunomodulatory properties in vitro and in vivo, but they have not <lb/>yet been characterized in the context of human disease. This study addresses the community <lb/>composition and immune function of this bacterial fraction in MS. We identify MS-associated <lb/>spore-forming taxa and show that their presence correlates with impaired differentiation of IL-10 <lb/>secreting, regulatory T lymphocytes in-vitro. Colonization of antibiotic-treated mice with spore-<lb/>forming bacteria allowed us to identify some bacterial taxa favoring IL-10 + lymphocyte <lb/>differentiation and others inducing differentiation of pro-inflammatory, IFN + T lymphocytes. <lb/>However, when fed into antibiotic-treated mice, both MS and control derived spore-forming <lb/>bacteria were able to induce immunoregulatory responses. <lb/>Our analysis also identified Akkermansia muciniphila as a key organism that may interact either <lb/>directly or indirectly with spore-forming bacteria to exacerbate the inflammatory effects of MS-<lb/>associated gut microbiota. Thus, changes in the spore-forming fraction may influence T <lb/>lymphocyte-mediated inflammation in MS. This experimental approach of isolating a subset of <lb/>microbiota based on its functional characteristics may be useful to investigate other microbial <lb/>fractions at greater depth. <lb/></front>

			<front>Importance: <lb/>Despite the rapid emergence of microbiome related studies in human diseases, few go beyond a <lb/>simple description of relative taxa levels in a select group of patients. Our study integrates <lb/>computational analysis with in vitro and in vivo exploration of inflammatory properties of both <lb/>complete microbial communities and individual taxa, revealing novel functional associations. <lb/>We specifically show that while small differences exist between the microbiomes of MS patients <lb/>and healthy subjects, these differences are exacerbated in the chloroform resistant fraction. We <lb/>further demonstrate that, when purified from MS patients, this fraction is associated with <lb/>impaired immunomodulatory responses in vitro. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The human gut microbiota is emerging as a major immune regulator in health and disease, <lb/>particularly in relation to autoimmune disorders. Most human microbiota studies to date have <lb/>been based on unbiased exploration of complete microbial communities. However, limited <lb/>sequencing depth, combined with high community richness and natural sample heterogeneity, <lb/>might hinder the discovery of physiologically relevant taxonomical differences. Thus, targeted <lb/>studies of specific microbial populations with defined characteristics may serve as a <lb/>complementary approach to investigate disease-associated changes in gut microbiome. <lb/>Spore-forming bacteria constitute a subset of Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to 3% <lb/>chloroform treatment (1, 2). Both human and mouse spore-forming bacteria have <lb/>immunoregulatory functions (3, 4). Mouse spore-forming bacteria include segmented <lb/>filamentous bacteria and Clostridia species, which have been shown to induce gut T helper <lb/>lymphocyte responses (3, 5). More recently, human spore-forming bacteria from a healthy <lb/>subject were also reported to induce Tregs in vitro and in gnotobiotic mice (4). However, <lb/>whether the composition and functions of spore-forming bacteria are altered in immune mediated <lb/>diseases is unknown. <lb/>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system, characterized by <lb/>autoimmune destruction of myelin. MS pathogenesis is in part mediated by effector T <lb/>lymphocytes, and counterbalanced by Tregs, that limit the autoimmune damage inflicted by the <lb/>former population (6, 7) and potentially promote remyelination (8). Recent studies, including our <lb/>own, associated MS with moderate changes in the relative amounts of gut microbiota that <lb/>exacerbate T lymphocyte-mediated inflammation in vitro and in vivo by stimulating pro-<lb/>inflammatory IFN+ Th1 and inhibiting IL-10+ regulatory T lymphocytes (9, 10). <lb/>We hypothesized that these MS-associated changes in gut microbial communities may involve <lb/>spore-forming bacteria thus altering its overall immunoregulatory properties. To address this <lb/>hypothesis, we isolated spore-forming bacteria from untreated patients with relapsing-remitting <lb/>MS (RRMS) and matched controls and analyzed their community composition and <lb/></body>

			<body>immunoregulatory functions in vitro and in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis <lb/>(EAE) mouse model. <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>Results <lb/>MS-associated differences in microbial community composition are more evident in the <lb/>spore-forming fraction <lb/>We isolated the spore-forming bacterial fraction from stool samples of 25 untreated MS patients <lb/>and 24 controls and tested their relative abundance by amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA V4 <lb/>gene sequencing. This analysis revealed no differences in community richness between patients <lb/>and controls (Chao1 metric of alpha diversity, Fig. 1A). However, a focused analysis on the <lb/>spore-forming fraction increased sample variability both within and between groups (Fig. 1B) <lb/>possibly by reducing the number of taxa of interest and thus amplifying the differences in their <lb/>relative abundances (Fig. 1A, 1C). <lb/>Spore-forming bacteria showed notable differences in taxonomical composition between cases <lb/>and controls, with 22.43% (135 out of 602 total) OTUs significantly different (p=0.05, negative <lb/>binomial Wald test, Benjamini-Hochberg correction) (Fig. 1D and Suppl. Table 1). These <lb/>taxonomical differences were also noticeable at the class level in which Bacilli were significantly <lb/>overrepresented in controls (Fig. 1E), and Clostridia, including Clostridium perfringens were <lb/>significantly overrepresented in MS patients (Fig. 1F and Suppl. Fig. S1). <lb/>Spore-forming bacteria from MS patients fail to induce anti-inflammatory T lymphocytes <lb/>in vitro <lb/>To investigate whether MS-associated differences in community composition of spore-forming <lb/>bacteria were sufficient to alter the immune functions of primary blood mononuclear cells <lb/>(PBMCs) from healthy human donors, we exposed human PBMCs to extracts of spore-forming <lb/>bacteria isolated either from unrelated controls or from MS patients and used flow cytometry to <lb/>evaluate T lymphocyte differentiation under different polarizing conditions (18-20). A <lb/>comparison of the PBMC response to extracts of spore-forming bacteria from controls or from <lb/>MS patients identified lower conversion into CD4+FoxP3+ Tregs (Fig. 2 A, C), including IL-10 <lb/>expressing Treg population (Fig. 2 B, D) in the PBMCs exposed to the MS-derived spore-<lb/>forming bacteria. These data suggest that spore-forming bacteria from MS patients are <lb/>significantly less effective at inducing Treg differentiation. Of note, the small population of <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>Tregs that still differentiated in response to MS bacteria, retained their suppressive capacities in <lb/>vitro (Fig. 2E), thereby indicating that this was a functionally active population. Interestingly, the <lb/>percentage of IL-10+ Tregs induced by extracts of spore-forming bacteria positively correlated <lb/>with the relative abundance of Bacilli and negatively correlated with the relative abundance of <lb/>Clostridia (Fig. 2 F, expressed as Clostridia-Bacilli difference). Thus, the community <lb/>composition of spore-forming bacteria (i.e. high Clostridia, low Bacilli) associated with MS was <lb/>also correlated with an inhibition of their respective immunoregulatory functions. <lb/>Gnotobiotic mouse models reveal associations between individual bacterial taxa and T <lb/>lymphocyte responses <lb/>To determine whether the MS-associated reduction in the ability of spore-forming bacteria to <lb/>stimulate Treg differentiation was physiologically significant, we colonized a group of female <lb/>antibiotic-treated mice (21) with spore-forming bacteria from either controls (n=2) or MS <lb/>subjects (n=2) and measured the course and severity of EAE. We observed a significant <lb/>reduction in disease severity in all mice whose GI tracts were reconstituted with spore-forming <lb/>bacteria. However, this reduction was independent of whether the spore-forming fraction was <lb/>isolated from MS or controls (Fig. 3 A). This indicated that while MS-derived spore-forming <lb/>bacteria could be functionally distinguished in vitro, these differences were not sufficient to <lb/>induce a phenotype in vivo in our experimental setting. <lb/>We next analyzed whether spore-forming bacteria regulated T lymphocyte responses in vivo. To <lb/>this end we colonized antibiotic-treated mice with spore-forming bacteria from 3 controls and 3 <lb/>MS patients and analyzed the resulting changes in bacterial composition and T lymphocyte <lb/>differentiation. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the beta diversity of gut microbiota <lb/>separated SPF mice from antibiotic-treated and colonized (i.e. gnotobiotic) mice. While no major <lb/>shifts in community composition based on disease state of the donor were observed (Fig. 3B), <lb/>multiple microbial taxa were differentially abundant (Fig. 3C, Suppl. Tables 2, 3), including an <lb/>increase in Akkermansia (3 OTUs corresponding to A. muciniphila; Suppl. Table 3) in mice <lb/>colonized with spore-forming bacteria from MS patients. <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>Further investigation identified individual taxa that were classified as either pro-inflammatory or <lb/>anti-inflammatory-based on the correlation between their relative abundance in mouse stool <lb/>samples and their ability to alter differentiation of IFN+ Th1 or IL-10+ regulatory lymphocytes <lb/>from either spleen or mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) in vitro (Fig. 3D, 3E). The pro-<lb/>inflammatory category (Fig. 3D, red rectangle) included taxa significantly increased in mice <lb/>colonized with spore-forming bacteria from MS patients compared to controls (highlighted in <lb/>red), while the anti-inflammatory category (mostly evident in splenocytes; blue rectangle) <lb/>contained taxa significantly reduced in mice colonized with spore-forming bacteria from MS <lb/>patients (highlighted in blue). <lb/>The increase in Akkermansia muciniphila, a non-spore-forming bacteria, in gnotobiotic mice <lb/>colonized with spore-forming bacteria from MS patients led to the hypothesis that spore-forming <lb/>bacteria may regulate Akkermansia levels. The correlation between spore-forming community <lb/>composition and relative abundance of Akkermansia is shown in Fig. 4A. The increase in <lb/>Akkermansia was present not only in the mice colonized with spore-forming bacteria from MS <lb/>donors, but also in MS donors themselves (p = 1.5E -09 , negative binomial Wald test) (Fig. 4B). <lb/>Of interest, we and others (9, 10) recently reported the increased abundance of Akkermansia in <lb/>untreated MS patients and identified this bacterium as sufficient for driving T lymphocyte <lb/>differentiation into the pro-inflammatory IFN+ Th1 phenotype in-vitro (10). Consistent with <lb/>this result, we also observed a significant positive correlation between the relative abundance of <lb/>Akkermansia and IFN+ Th1 lymphocyte differentiation (Fig. 4C) in gnotobiotic mice. While <lb/>other taxa also correlated with Akkermansia levels and T lymphocyte differentiation (Fig. 4D) <lb/>our data suggest that the observed immunological effects may be at least partially mediated by <lb/>Akkermansia. <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>The spore-forming fraction of gut bacteria has been associated with immunoregulatory properties <lb/>(4). Here we examined the structural composition and immunological effects of the spore-<lb/>forming fraction of gut microbiota from subjects with MS compared to controls. MS-associated <lb/>differences in bacterial community composition were correlated with impaired anti-inflammatory <lb/>functions, as evidenced by a reduction in their ability to drive T lymphocyte differentiation into <lb/>IL-10+ Tregs in vitro. Meanwhile, colonizing antibiotic-treated mice with spore-forming <lb/>bacteria allowed us to identify specific taxa correlated with T lymphocyte differentiation into <lb/>IFN+ and IL-10+ subtypes in vivo. <lb/>Our results contribute to the evidence supporting the immunoregulatory functions of spore-<lb/>forming bacteria and show that these functions may be compromised in the context of <lb/>autoimmunity. Previous studies on spore-forming bacteria had been conducted by isolating this <lb/>fraction from a single healthy donor (4, 22). This approach allowed focusing on donor-specific <lb/>bacterial strains, but provided limited information about the &quot;baseline&quot; composition and <lb/>variability of this bacterial community in healthy humans. Here we used multiple healthy control <lb/>donors to establish the baseline community composition of spore-forming bacteria, and <lb/>compared these healthy profiles with those from patients with MS. <lb/>Our data corroborate previous findings that spore-forming bacteria, almost exclusively belonging <lb/>to the phylum Firmicutes, and classes Clostridia and Bacilli, induce anti-inflammatory T <lb/>lymphocytes in vitro and protect from autoimmune inflammation in vivo (4, 5). We also show <lb/>that the taxonomical distribution and immunoregulatory functions of spore-forming bacteria are <lb/>altered in MS patients. While were able to show that these differences have functional <lb/>consequences in-vitro, they were not sufficient to alter the course of EAE using antibiotic treated <lb/>mice. One possible explanation for this counterintuitive finding is that since our mice were <lb/>treated with antibiotics, they were not completely germ-free prior to colonization. As a <lb/>consequence, unexpected interactions among antibiotic resistant communities and the spore-<lb/>forming fraction may have influenced the course of EAE. We recognize that using GF mice for <lb/>these experiments could address some of these concerns. However, raising GF animals is still a <lb/>highly specialized enterprise only available at select institutions. Further studies of gene <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>expression and metabolic output of spore-forming bacteria may provide therapeutic targets for <lb/>regulating T lymphocyte responses to reduce autoimmune inflammation. <lb/>The mechanisms by which spore-forming bacteria regulate host T lymphocyte differentiation <lb/>remain to be discovered. Interestingly, an overlapping subset of bacterial taxa has recently been <lb/>shown to inhibit host proteases, including cathepsins (23), which mediate adaptive immune <lb/>responses by increasing Th17 (24) and limiting Treg differentiation (25). Although future studies <lb/>are needed to establish this firmly, it is possible that spore-forming bacteria from controls, but <lb/>not MS patients are able to stimulate Treg responses via cathepsin inhibition. <lb/>Furthermore, healthy human spore-forming bacteria produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), <lb/>including butyrate and acetate (26), which have been observed to stimulate Treg and inhibit Th1 <lb/>differentiation in vitro and in vivo (27), Mizuno 2017). Either pure butyrate or butyrate-<lb/>producing spore-forming bacteria from healthy humans have been shown to be sufficient Treg <lb/>induction (28) in mice. Thus, human T lymphocyte differentiation into Tregs may be driven by a <lb/>yet-undiscovered SCFA-synthesizing subset of spore-forming bacteria that is present in controls <lb/>and absent in MS patients. <lb/>Akkermansia muciniphila has previously been reported to be increased in MS patients compared <lb/>to controls (9, 10, 29) and to have pro-inflammatory functions in vitro (10). In addition, <lb/>Akkermansia has been shown to be resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics (30), which in part <lb/>may explain its persistence in mice colonized with spore-forming bacteria. The fact that high <lb/>levels of Akkermansia were only seen in mice colonized with MS chloroform-resistant bacteria <lb/>suggests that its population is normally regulated by commensals that are depleted in MS thus <lb/>enabling Akkermansia overgrowth. <lb/>Our finding that Clostridium perfringens is more abundant in the spore-forming bacterial fraction <lb/>of MS patients is consistent with the association of C. perfringens with neuromyelitis optica <lb/>(NMO), another demyelinating autoimmune disease (31-33). Putative mechanisms of C. <lb/>perfringens-mediated autoimmunity include molecular mimicry between C. perfringens peptide <lb/></body>

			<body>and a self-antigen in the human host (Varrin-Doyer 2012), and toxin-mediated increase in <lb/>neuronal damage (32, 34). <lb/>Due to the high variability of spore-forming bacteria across donors, mouse colonization with <lb/>samples from additional donor pairs would be required to assess whether MS-associated <lb/>reduction in regulatory T lymphocyte differentiation in vitro can be reliably reproduced in vivo. <lb/>However, a major advantage of gnotobiotic mouse models is the ability to assess the association <lb/>between immune responses and microbial abundance within experimental communities. The <lb/>identification of additional taxa capable of inducing clear differentiation paths in immune cells <lb/>will further contribute to our understanding their role in immune regulation. For example, our <lb/>findings corroborate the anti-inflammatory functions of relatively unknown bacterial genera such <lb/>as Anaeroplasma and Dehalobacterium in mouse models of inflammation (35, 36). <lb/>In conclusion, we have investigated the immune functions of the spore-forming fraction of <lb/>human gut microbiota in health and disease, using MS as a model of autoimmune inflammation. <lb/>We identified novel bacterial taxa associated with MS as well as with T lymphocyte <lb/>differentiation into both pro-inflammatory and regulatory phenotypes. Further studies of spore-<lb/>forming bacteria and other experimentally defined bacterial populations may reveal specific <lb/>immunoregulatory mechanisms in MS and other diseases that may be targeted by therapeutic <lb/>interventions. <lb/></body>

			<body>Materials and Methods <lb/>Isolation of spore-forming bacteria from human fecal samples <lb/>Fecal samples were collected from 25 adult patients with RRMS that had not received disease-<lb/>modifying or steroid treatment for at least 3 months prior to the time of collection and 24 <lb/>subjects without MS or any other autoimmune disorder (controls) at the University of California, <lb/>San Francisco (UCSF) (Table 1). The inclusion criteria specified no use of antibiotics or <lb/>oncologic therapeutics in 3 months prior to the study. All individuals signed a written informed <lb/>consent in accordance with the sampling procedure approved by the local Institutional Review <lb/>Board. Samples were stored in collection vials (Fisher #NC9779954) at -80° C until bacterial <lb/>isolation. <lb/>Spore-forming bacteria were isolated based on their resistance to chloroform as described <lb/>previously (Atarashi 2013). Briefly, total bacteria were isolated from stool samples by <lb/>suspending ~0.5mg stool sample in 1.5ml PBS, passing it three times through a 70m cell <lb/>strainer and washing twice with 1.5ml PBS by spinning at 8000rpm. The resulting suspension <lb/>was diluted in 5ml PBS, mixed with chloroform to the final concentration of 3%, and incubated <lb/>on a shaker for 1h at room temperature. After incubation, chloroform was removed from the <lb/>solution by bubbling nitrogen (N2) gas for 30min. Chloroform-treated bacteria were then <lb/>cultured on OxyPRAS Brucella Blood Agar plates (Oxyrase #P-BRU-BA) for 96 hours followed <lb/>by Brucella Broth (Anaerobe Systems #AS-105) for 48 hours, and isolated for sequencing, in <lb/>vitro experiments and in vivo experiments. <lb/>16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and computational analysis <lb/>DNA was extracted from mouse fecal or human chloroform-resistant bacterial culture samples <lb/>using MoBio Power Fecal DNA extraction kit (MoBio #12830) according to manufacturer&apos;s <lb/>instructions. For each sample, PCR targeting the V4 region of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene <lb/>was completed in triplicate using the 515/806 primer pair, and amplicons were sequenced on <lb/>NextSeq at the Microbiome Profiling Services core facility at UCSF using the sequencing <lb/>primers and procedures described in the Earth Microbiome Project standard protocol (11). <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>Analysis was performed using QIIME v1.9 as described (12). Essentially, amplicon sequences <lb/>were quality-filtered and grouped to &quot;species-level&quot; OTUs via SortMeRNA method (13), using <lb/>Greengenes v.13.8 97% dataset for closed reference. Sequences that did not match reference <lb/>sequences in the Greengenes database were dropped from analysis. Taxonomy was assigned to <lb/>the retained OTUs based on the Greengenes reference sequence, and the Greengenes tree was <lb/>used for all downstream phylogenetic community comparisons. OTUs were filtered to retain <lb/>only OTUs present in at least 5% of samples and covering at least 100 total reads. After filtering, <lb/>samples were rarefied to 10000 sequences per sample. Alpha diversity was calculated using the <lb/>Chao1 method (14). For analysis of beta diversity, pairwise distance matrices were generated <lb/>using the phylogenetic metric unweighted UniFrac (15) and used for principal coordinate <lb/>analysis (PCoA). For comparison of individual taxa, samples were not rarefied. Instead, OTU <lb/>abundances were normalized using variance-stabilizing transformation and taxa distributions <lb/>were compared using Wald negative binomial test from R software package DESeq2 as <lb/>described previously (16, 17) with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. <lb/>Linear correlations between bacterial taxa and lymphocyte proportions were computed after <lb/>variance-stabilizing transformation of bacterial abundances (16). <lb/>Mouse colonization with microbiota <lb/>Female littermates 5 week old C57BL/6J mice (JAX #000664) were treated with 1% solution of <lb/>Amphotericin B in drinking water for 3 days, followed by 2 weeks of a solution composed of 1% <lb/>Amphotericin B, 1mg/ml ampicillin, 1mg/ml neomycin, 1mg/ml metronidazole and 0.5mg/ml <lb/>vancomycin in drinking water. After 2 weeks, the drinking solution was replaced by sterile water <lb/>and mice were gavaged with specific bacteria of interest at 2*10^8 CFU in 100ul per mouse <lb/>every 2 days for 2 weeks (7 total gavages). Bacterial colonization was either followed by the <lb/>induction of EAE or immunophenotyping of mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes. <lb/>To induce EAE, mice were immunized in both flanks with 0.1ml MOG 35-55 emulsion (1.5 <lb/>mg/ml) mixed with Complete Freud&apos;s Adjuvant and killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra <lb/>(2mg/ml), followed by two 0.1ml intraperitoneal injections of pertussis toxin (2µg/ml) <lb/>immediately and at 48h after MOG/CFA injections. Mice were scored daily in a blinded fashion <lb/>for motor deficits as follows: 0, no deficit; 1, limp tail only; 2, limp tail and hind limb weakness; <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>3, complete hind limb paralysis; 4, complete hind limb paralysis and at least partial forelimb <lb/>paralysis; 5, moribund. <lb/>At the time of euthanasia, mouse mesenteric lymph nodes, and spleens were dissected and <lb/>processed by grinding tissues through a 70µm cell strainer. Entire mesenteric and cervical lymph <lb/>nodes and 10^7 splenocytes per mouse were stimulated for 4-5 hours with 20ng/ml PMA and <lb/>1µg/ml ionomycin in presence of protein transport inhibitor (GolgiPlug, BD #51-2301KZ) and <lb/>used immediately for immunophenotyping, while the remaining splenocytes were stored for in <lb/>vitro bacterial stimulations. <lb/>Bacterial stimulation of human immune cells <lb/>Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy volunteers and stored at -<lb/>80° C in cryovials at 10^7 cells/ml concentration in FBS containing 10% DMSO. Before plating, <lb/>cells were washed in PBS twice, re-counted, and plated at 10^6 cells/ml concentration in RPMI <lb/>media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine. Cells were <lb/>stimulated for 3 days as described previously (18) with anti-human CD3 (BD #555336, 0.3 <lb/>µg/ml), anti-human CD28 (BD #555725, 2 µg/ml) and recombinant human TGF-1 (R&amp;D <lb/>#240B002, 2.5ng/ml). <lb/>Bacteria isolated from human chloroform-resistant cultures were resuspended in PBS <lb/>supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche #4693159001) and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche <lb/>#4906845001), heat-inactivated at 65° C for 1h and sonicated for 10min as described previously <lb/>(19). Protein concentration in the resulting suspension was measured using the Pierce BCA <lb/>protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific #23227). Bacterial extracts were added to PBMCs at 1µg/ml <lb/>1h after plating as described previously (20). PBS with the same protease inhibitor and <lb/>phosphatase inhibitor was added as the no-bacteria control. Each human in vitro experiment <lb/>contained at least 6 independent donor bacterial samples and was repeated at least twice. <lb/>Immunostaining, flow cytometry and FACS of human immune cells <lb/>Human PBMCs were immunostained using standard protocols. Live/dead cell gating was <lb/>achieved using Live/Dead Fixable Aqua kit (ThermoFisher #L34957). FoxP3/transcription factor <lb/></body>

			<page>15 <lb/></page>

			<body>staining buffer set (eBioscience #00-5523-00) was used for staining of intracellular and <lb/>intranuclear cytokines. The following antibodies were used for human PBMC staining: anti-<lb/>CD3-PE.Cy7 (BD #563423), anti-CD4-PerCP.Cy5.5 (BioLegend #300530), anti-CD25-APC <lb/>(BD #555434), anti-FoxP3-AlexaFluor488 (BD #560047) and anti-IL-10-PE (eBioscience #12-<lb/>7108). <lb/>Flow cytometry was performed on BD Fortessa cell analyzer and analyzed using FlowJo <lb/>software (TreeStar). Cells were gated to identify the lymphocyte population based on forward <lb/>and side scatter, followed by gating for single color and live cell populations. Fluorescence <lb/>minus one (FMO) was used for gating. Unstained, single color and fluorescence-minus-one <lb/>controls were used to identify stained populations. For T lymphocyte suppression assay, control <lb/>CD4+ CD25+ lymphocytes were sorted from PBMC cultures incubated with extracts from <lb/>unrelated control or MS spore-forming bacteria in Treg-differentiating conditions on Aria III cell <lb/>sorter (BD Biosciences) and cultured with CD4+ CD25-from the same donor pre-loaded with a <lb/>CFSE cell division tracker kit. Statistical significance of expression changes in markers of T <lb/>lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation was determined using two-tailed Student&apos;s t test to <lb/>compare samples from different donors and two-tailed repeated measures t test to compare <lb/>samples from the same donor. GraphPad Prism 6 software was used to analyze and plot the data. <lb/>P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <lb/></body>
