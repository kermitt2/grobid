			<front>Abstract <lb/>Two broadly known characteristics of germ cells in many organisms are their development as a <lb/>&apos;cyst&apos; of interconnected cells and their high sensitivity to DNA damage. Here we provide <lb/>evidence that these characteristics are linked, and that interconnectivity is a mechanism that <lb/>confers to the Drosophila testis a high sensitivity to DNA damage. We show that all germ cells <lb/>within a cyst die simultaneously even when only a subset of them exhibit detectable DNA <lb/>damage. Compromising connectivity results in cysts in which only a subset of germ cells die <lb/>upon DNA damage, lowering overall germ cell death. Our data indicate that a death-promoting <lb/>signal is shared through the intercellular connections of germ cells. Taken together, we propose <lb/>that intercellular connectivity is a mechanism that uniquely increases the sensitivity of the <lb/>germline to DNA damage, thereby protecting the integrity of gamete genomes that are passed on <lb/>to the next generation. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>A prevalent feature of germ cell development across species is their proliferation as an <lb/>interconnected cluster of cells, widely known as a germ cell cyst. In many organisms from <lb/>insects to humans, germ cells divide with incomplete cytokinesis that results in interconnected <lb/>cells with shared cytoplasm, leading to cyst formation (Greenbaum, Iwamori, Buchold, &amp; <lb/>Matzuk, 2011; Haglund, Nezis, &amp; Stenmark, 2011; Pepling, de Cuevas, &amp; Spradling, 1999). <lb/>During oogenesis, this intercellular connectivity is critical for the process of oocyte specification, <lb/>allowing only some of the developing germ cells to become oocytes while the others adopt a <lb/>supportive role (de Cuevas, Lilly, &amp; Spradling, 1997; Lei &amp; Spradling, 2016; Pepling et al., <lb/>1999). For example, in the Drosophila ovary, four rounds of germ cell divisions with incomplete <lb/>cytokinesis results in a cyst of 16 interconnected germ cells, where only one becomes an oocyte <lb/>while the remaining 15 germ cells become nurse cells. During this process, nurse cells support <lb/>oocyte development by providing their cytoplasmic contents to oocytes via intercellular <lb/>trafficking (Cox, 2003; de Cuevas et al., 1997; Huynh &amp; St Johnston, 2004). In contrast to <lb/>oogenesis, where cytoplasmic connectivity has a clear developmental role in oocyte <lb/>determination, spermatogenesis is a process where all germ cells within a cyst are considered to <lb/>be equivalent and become mature gametes (Fuller, 1993; Yoshida, 2016). Despite the lack of a <lb/>&apos;nursing mechanism&apos; during spermatogenesis, intercellular connectivity is widely observed in <lb/>spermatogenesis from insects to humans (Greenbaum et al., 2011; Yoshida, 2016). While a <lb/>function for this connectivity has been proposed in post-meiotic spermatids (Braun, Behringer, <lb/>Peschon, Brinster, &amp; Palmiter, 1989), the biological significance of male germ cell connectivity <lb/>during pre-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis remains unknown. <lb/>Another well-known characteristic of the germline is its extreme sensitivity to DNA <lb/>damage compared to the soma, with clinical interventions such as radiation or chemotherapy <lb/>often resulting in impaired fertility (Arnon, Meirow, Lewis-Roness, &amp; Ornoy, 2001; Meistrich, <lb/>2013; Oakberg, 1955). It has been postulated that the high sensitivity of the germline to DNA <lb/>damage is part of a quality control mechanism for the germ cell genome, which is passed on to <lb/>the next generation (Gunes, Al-Sadaan, &amp; Agarwal, 2015). However, the means by which the <lb/>germline achieves such a high sensitivity to DNA damage remains unclear. <lb/>Here we provide evidence that germ cell connectivity serves as a mechanism to sensitize <lb/>the germline in response to DNA damage, inducing cell death in the Drosophila testis. We show <lb/>that an entire germ cell cyst undergoes synchronized cell death as a unit even when only a subset <lb/>of cells within the cyst exhibit detectable DNA damage. Disruption of germ cell connectivity in <lb/>mutants of the fusome, an organelle that connects the germ cells within a cyst, leads to death of <lb/>individual germ cells within a cyst in response to DNA damage, reducing overall germ cell <lb/>death. The sensitivity of a germ cell cyst to DNA damage increases as the number of <lb/>interconnected germ cells within increases, demonstrating that connectivity serves as a <lb/>mechanism to confer higher sensitivity to DNA damage. Taken together, we propose that germ <lb/></body>

			<body>cell cyst formation serves as a mechanism to increase the sensitivity of genome surveillance, <lb/>ensuring the quality of the genome that is passed on to the next generation. <lb/>Results <lb/>Ionizing radiation induces spermatogonial death preferentially at the 16-cell stage. <lb/>The Drosophila testis serves as an excellent model to study germ cell development owing <lb/>to its well-defined spatiotemporal organization, with spermatogenesis proceeding from the apical <lb/>tip down the length of the testis. Germline stem cells (GSCs) divide to produce gonialblasts <lb/>(GBs), which undergo transit-amplifying divisions to become a cyst of 16 interconnected <lb/>spermatogonia (16-SG) before entering meiosis (Fig. 1A). In our previous study we showed that <lb/>protein starvation induces SG death, predominantly at the early stages (~4-SG stage) of SG <lb/>development (Yang &amp; Yamashita, 2015) (Fig. 1A). Starvation-induced SG death is mediated by <lb/>apoptosis of somatic cyst cells encapsulating the SGs (Yang &amp; Yamashita, 2015), which breaks <lb/>the &apos;blood-testis-barrier&apos; and leads to SG death (Fairchild, Smendziuk, &amp; Tanentzapf, 2015; Lim <lb/>&amp; Fuller, 2012). Though we also noted significant SG death at the 16-SG stage in the course of <lb/>our previous work, it was independent of nutrient conditions and thus was not the focus of the <lb/>study (Yang &amp; Yamashita, 2015). <lb/>In search of the cause of this 16-SG death, we discovered that it can be induced by <lb/>ionizing radiation (see methods). When adult flies were exposed to ionizing radiation that causes <lb/>DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), a dramatic induction of SG death was observed (Fig. 1B, C). <lb/>Dying SGs induced by ionizing radiation were detected by Lysotracker staining, which marks <lb/>acidified compartments, a hallmark of germ cell death (Yacobi-Sharon, Namdar, &amp; Arama, <lb/>2013; Yang &amp; Yamashita, 2015). SG death in control and irradiated flies proceeded in the same <lb/>manner, where all of the SGs within a cyst die simultaneously by becoming Lysotracker-positive <lb/>(Fig. 1B). Importantly, in contrast to starvation-induced SG death, which was dependent on <lb/>somatic cyst cell apoptosis, radiation-induced SG death was not suppressed by inhibiting cyst <lb/>cell apoptosis (Fig. 1 -Figure supplement 1), suggesting that radiation-induced SG death is a <lb/>germ cell-intrinsic response. <lb/>The frequency of dying SG cysts peaked around 3 to 6 hours after irradiation and <lb/>decreased by 24 hours post-irradiation (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, we found that ionizing radiation <lb/>robustly induces cell death at the 16-SG stage, although death of other stages (2-, 4-, 8-cell SGs) <lb/>was also induced (Fig. 1C and see below). This pattern of SG death held true regardless of the <lb/>ionizing radiation dose (Fig. 1 -Figure supplement 2). While testing multiple doses of ionizing <lb/>radiation, we noticed that even exposure to a very low dose of ionizing radiation could <lb/>dramatically induce death of 16-SGs. By measuring dose-dependent death of 16-SGs at six hours <lb/>post-irradiation, we found that the 16-SG death induced by increasing radiation was a distinctly <lb/></body>

			<body>non-linear response, quickly reaching a plateau of ~3 dying 16-SG cysts per testis (Fig. 1D). In <lb/>comparison, somatic cell death in a defined area of the irradiated wing imaginal disc (Fig. 1 -<lb/>Figure supplement 3) followed a linear dose-response relationship where an increase in radiation <lb/>resulted in a proportional increase in cell death (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate a <lb/>remarkable sensitivity of 16-SGs to ionizing radiation, compared to somatic cells from imaginal <lb/>discs. <lb/>All SGs within a cyst die even when only a subset of cells exhibit detectable DNA damage. <lb/>To gain insight into the cause of the unusual sensitivity of 16-SGs to DNA damage, we <lb/>evaluated the response of SGs to ionizing radiation at a cell biological level. DSBs result in <lb/>phosphorylation of the histone H2A variant (γ-H2Av), the Drosophila equivalent of mammalian <lb/>γ-H2AX, reflecting the very early cellular response to DSBs (Madigan, Chotkowski, &amp; Glaser, <lb/>2002). Using an anti-γ-H2Av antibody (pS137), we confirmed that γ-H2Av can be robustly <lb/>detected in SGs following a high dose of ionizing radiation (Fig. 2 -Figure supplement 1). When <lb/>a low dose of ionizing radiation was used, we frequently observed 16-SG cysts in which only a <lb/>subset of cells within the cyst possessed detectable γ-H2Av signal but all 16 cells were <lb/>Lysotracker-positive and dying (Fig. 2A). <lb/>The fraction of γ-H2Av-positive SGs within each cyst increased gradually with <lb/>increasing radiation dose irrespective of SG stage (Fig. 2B and Fig. 2 -Figure supplement 2), <lb/>consistent with the linear nature of ionizing radiation damaging DNA molecules (Ulsh, 2010). <lb/>However, Lysotracker staining showed that SGs within a cyst were always either all <lb/>Lysotracker-positive or -negative (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that while DNA damage is <lb/>induced in individual SGs within a cyst proportional to the dose of radiation, cell death is <lb/>induced in all of the SGs within the entire cyst, leading to elevated SG death that follows a non-<lb/>linear response with increasing dose. <lb/>The fusome is required for synchronized all-or-none SG death within the cysts. <lb/>The above results led us to hypothesize that all SGs within a cyst might be triggered to <lb/>die together even when only a subset of SGs within the cyst have detectable DNA damage, <lb/>explaining the extremely high sensitivity of the germline to DNA damage. In Drosophila and <lb/>other insects, the fusome is a germline-specific membranous organelle that connects the <lb/>cytoplasm of germ cells within a cyst and mediates intracyst signaling amongst germ cells (Lilly, <lb/>de Cuevas, &amp; Spradling, 2000; Lin, Yue, &amp; Spradling, 1994). We speculated that if germ cell <lb/>cysts undergo synchronized cell death by sharing the decision to die, the fusome might mediate <lb/>the &apos;all-or-none&apos; mode of SG death upon DNA damage. <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>To examine the role of the fusome in all-or-none SG death upon irradiation, we used <lb/>RNAi-mediated knockdown of α-spectrin and a mutant of hts, core components of the fusome <lb/>(de Cuevas, Lee, &amp; Spradling, 1996; Lilly et al., 2000; Lin et al., 1994) (Fig. 3 -Figure <lb/>supplement 1). Mutant and control flies were irradiated and their testes were stained with <lb/>Lysotracker to identify dying SGs in combination with the lipophilic dye FM 4-64 to mark cyst <lb/>cell membranes, demarcating the boundaries of SG cysts (see methods) (Chiang, Yang, &amp; <lb/>Yamashita, 2017). In control testes, 16-SG cysts were almost always found to be either <lb/>completely Lysotracker-positive or -negative under all conditions tested as described above, <lb/>indicating that 16-SG cysts make an all-or-none death decision (Fig. 3A, B, E, F). Of particular <lb/>importance, even at a lower dose of radiation (e.g. 100 rad) where only a subset of germ cells <lb/>exhibit visible γ-H2Av staining (Fig. 2B), the 16-SG cyst was either entirely Lysotracker-<lb/>negative or -positive. In contrast, α-spectrin RNAi and hts mutant testes frequently contained 16-<lb/>SG cysts with a mixture of individual Lysotracker-positive and -negative SGs (Fig. 3C, D, G, H), <lb/>suggesting that the all-or-none mode of SG death was compromised. Importantly, the mean <lb/>fraction of 16-SG that died in response to radiation exposure at any dose was significantly <lb/>reduced when the fusome was disrupted (Fig. 3B, D, F, H, see Supplementary Table S1 for <lb/>statistics). These data show that the fusome is required for the coordinated death of all SGs <lb/>within a cyst, and suggests that connectivity of SGs increases overall SG death in response to <lb/>radiation-induced DNA damage. Moreover, the fact that loss of germ cell connectivity in fusome <lb/>mutants allows for the survival of some SGs strongly argues against the possibility that SGs <lb/>without cytologically detectable γ-H2Av are sufficiently damaged to trigger cell death on their <lb/>own, and that SGs are individually dying. Instead, the death of SGs without detectable γ-H2Av <lb/>in wild type/control can likely be attributed to a shared signal from other cells, as blockade of <lb/>intercellular communication in fusome mutants allows for their survival. <lb/>The mitochondrial protease HtrA2/Omi is required for all-or-none SG death <lb/>The above results suggest that intercellular connectivity mediated by the fusome plays a <lb/>critical role in allowing for all-or-none commitment of SGs to death or survival. Based on these <lb/>results, we hypothesized that a signal to promote cell death exists that is rapidly transmitted from <lb/>damaged SGs to others via their intercellular connections. <lb/>It has previously been shown that germ cell death in the Drosophila testis depends on <lb/>mitochondria-associated factors rather than effector caspases (Yacobi-Sharon et al., 2013). In <lb/>response to nuclear DNA damage, the Drosophila homolog of the mitochondrial serine protease <lb/>HtrA2/Omi is cleaved and released from the mitochondrial compartment as part of the <lb/>mitochondria-associated death pathway, and interacts with components of the apoptotic <lb/>machinery in the cytoplasm to promote cell death (Igaki et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2008; Tain et <lb/>al., 2009; Vande Walle, Lamkanfi, &amp; Vandenabeele, 2008). <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>In HtrA2/Omi mutant flies, we frequently observed a mix of Lysotracker-positive and -<lb/>negative SGs within a single cyst, similar to what was seen in fusome mutants (Fig. 4A). <lb/>Disruption of the all-or-none mode of SG death within the cyst was observed at any dose of <lb/>radiation tested (Fig. 4B). Disrupted all-or-none SG death occurred in both heterozygous <lb/>(Omi Δ1 /+) and transheterozygous (Omi Δ1 /Omi Df1 ) conditions, consistent with the previous report <lb/>that heterozygous conditions exhibit haploinsufficiency in inducing SG death (Yacobi-Sharon et <lb/>al., 2013). In contrast, wild type control 16-SG cysts maintained their all-or-none mode of SG <lb/>death (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these data show that HtrA2/Omi is critical for all-or-none SG <lb/>death within a cyst, and imply a role for HtrA2/Omi in propagating the signal to initiate germ <lb/>cell death within a SG cyst, possibly through its cycle of cleavage and release from <lb/>mitochondria. <lb/>p53 and mnk/chk2 do not regulate the all-or-none mode of SG death <lb/>The DNA damage response is a highly conserved pathway controlling cell death and <lb/>DNA repair (Ciccia &amp; Elledge, 2010; Song, 2005). We thus examined the potential involvement <lb/>in radiation-induced SG death of the universal DNA damage response pathway components, <lb/>mnk/chk2 and p53, whose conserved function in DNA damage response in Drosophila has been <lb/>shown (Brodsky et al., 2004; Peters et al., 2002). By using well-characterized loss-of-function <lb/>alleles (mnk 6006 and p53 5A-1-4 ) (Takada, Kelkar, &amp; Theurkauf, 2003; Wichmann, Jaklevic, &amp; Su, <lb/>2006; Xie &amp; Golic, 2004), we found that these mutants broadly suppress SG death at high and <lb/>low doses of radiation (Fig. 5D). However, SG death in these mutants maintained an all-or-none <lb/>pattern (Fig. 5A-C, E). These results suggest that while p53 and mnk/chk2 may contribute to SG <lb/>death via their general role in controlling the DNA damage response as has been described in <lb/>somatic cells, they do not play a role in mediating the all-or-none pattern of SG death within a <lb/>cyst that is unique to interconnected germ cells. <lb/>Consistent with the idea that neither mnk/chk2 or p53 is responsible for a germline-<lb/>specific DNA damage response, Mnk/Chk2 or p53 was not upregulated in the germline in <lb/>response to a low dose of radiation (100 rad), which is normally sufficient to induce robust SG <lb/>death. Using a polyclonal anti-Mnk/Chk2 antibody (Takada, Collins, &amp; Kurahashi, 2015), we <lb/>were unable to detect induction of Mnk/Chk2 at a low radiation dose, and even at a high dose <lb/>Mnk/Chk2 staining was mostly limited to somatic cells (Fig. 5 -Figure supplement 1). Likewise, <lb/>a p53 transcriptional reporter (Wylie et al., 2014) was not upregulated in response to a low dose <lb/>of radiation (Fig. 5 -Figure supplement 2). Even at a high dose, the reporter expression was <lb/>observed only at 24 hours after irradiation, much later than the peak of SG death, which typically <lb/>happens within a few hours. Collectively, these data indicate that differential expression of p53 <lb/>or Mnk/Chk2 in SGs is unlikely to account for the high sensitivity of the germline to DNA <lb/>damage. <lb/></body>

			<body>Increasing connectivity of SGs inherently increases sensitivity to DNA damage <lb/>The above results suggest that the robust ability of SGs to trigger cell death in response to <lb/>DNA damage is facilitated by the sharing of signals to die amongst SGs within a cyst, killing <lb/>SGs that are not sufficiently damaged to commit to cell death on their own. This sharing of death <lb/>signals is mediated by and dependent on germ cell connectivity. If this is the case, it would be <lb/>predicted that increasing the connectivity of a SG cyst (the number of interconnected SGs within <lb/>the cyst) would increase its sensitivity to DNA damage. Indeed, as mentioned above, we <lb/>observed a trend of 16-SG cysts dying more frequently than 2-, 4-, or 8-SGs (Fig. 1C, Fig 1 -<lb/>Figure supplement 2). By plotting cell death frequency of all SG stages as a function of <lb/>increasing radiation dose (Fig. 6A), it becomes clear that the sensitivity of SG cysts correlates <lb/>with their connectivity, where 8-SGs are less sensitive than 16-SGs but more sensitive than 4-<lb/>SGs and so on. Interestingly, single-celled GBs, the immediate daughter of GSCs that have not <lb/>formed any intercellular connections, exhibited an essentially linear increase in death in response <lb/>to radiation dose, which is reminiscent of somatic imaginal disc cells (Fig. 1D). These results <lb/>further support the idea that germ cell connectivity plays a key role in increasing the sensitivity <lb/>of the germline to DNA damage. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Our present study may provide a link between two long-standing observations in germ <lb/>cell biology: 1) the broad conservation of intercellular connectivity (cyst formation) of germ <lb/>cells and 2) the increased sensitivity of the germline to DNA damage compared to the soma. Our <lb/>study shows that the connectivity of germ cells is a key mechanism for their ability to robustly <lb/>induce cell death. We propose that connectivity allows for the sharing of signals that leads to cell <lb/>death (Fig. 6B). We imagine two possibilities to explain how the signals are shared leading to <lb/>cell death: when one SG within a cyst decides to die, this &apos;decision of death&apos; might be sent to all <lb/>the other SGs within the cyst, leading to all-or-none SG death. Alternatively, the signal shared <lb/>among SGs may be &apos;additive&apos; in nature. In such a scenario, even when none of the individual <lb/>SGs have sufficient DNA damage to trigger cell death on its own, addition of all damage <lb/>signaling within the cyst might reach a level sufficient to cause activation of an intracellular <lb/>cascade that induces cell death. Such a response would effectively lower the threshold of DNA <lb/>damage needed per cell to trigger germ cell death. Either way, the sharing of signals between <lb/>SGs through intercellular connections increases their likelihood to die following DNA damage, <lb/>explaining the unusually high sensitivity of the germline to DNA damage. <lb/>According to this model, higher connectivity would confer higher sensitivity to DNA <lb/>damage: as the connectivity increases, more cells would contribute to detecting any DNA <lb/>damage the germline may be experiencing. Indeed, our data show a direct correlation between <lb/>sensitivity to radiation and the increasing connectivity of SG cysts (Fig. 6A). Remarkably, the <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>fact that single-celled, unconnected GBs exhibit an essentially linear death response to increasing <lb/>radiation suggests that individual germ cells do not have an intrinsically different DNA damage <lb/>response that accounts for their high sensitivity to DNA damage (Fig. 6A). <lb/>A connectivity-based increase in sensitivity to DNA damage also has an important <lb/>implication in the development of multicellular organisms. To pass on genomes to the next <lb/>generation, it is critically important for germ cells to have the most stringent mechanisms to <lb/>prevent deleterious mutations. However, as genome size increases in multicellular organisms, <lb/>ubiquitously increasing the stringency of genome quality control would result in a high rate of <lb/>cell death in all tissues, which could compromise the development or survival of organisms. <lb/>Thus, a multicellular organism would require differential sensitivities to DNA damage between <lb/>the soma and the germline. The germline would require a more sensitive genome surveillance <lb/>mechanism to produce gametes with the highest genome quality, whereas the priority of the <lb/>soma shifts toward survival in order to support development and maintenance of somatic organs. <lb/>A connectivity-based increase in sensitivity to DNA damage would be a simple method for <lb/>multicellular organisms to achieve drastically different sensitivities to DNA damage between the <lb/>soma and germline without having to alter intrinsic damage response pathways. Thus, we <lb/>speculate that one reason germ cell connectivity has arisen during evolution might be to confer <lb/>higher sensitivity to DNA damage specifically in the germline. <lb/></body>

			<body>All fly stocks were raised on standard Bloomington medium at 25°C, and young flies (0 <lb/>to 2-day old adults) were used for all experiments unless otherwise noted. The following fly <lb/>stocks were used: hts 01103 (Yuan, Chiang, Cheng, Salzmann, &amp; Yamashita, 2012), nos-gal4 (Van <lb/>Doren, Williamson, &amp; Lehmann, 1998), UAS-α-spectrin RNAi (TRiP.HMC04371), c587-gal4 <lb/>(Decotto &amp; Spradling, 2005), UAS-Diap1 (obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center), p53 5A-<lb/>1-4 (Wichmann et al., 2006; Xie &amp; Golic, 2004), Df(2R)BSC26, Df(3R)ED6096, Df(2L)Exel7077 <lb/>(obtained from the Bloomington Stock Center), p53RE-GFP-nls reporter (Wylie et al., 2014) (a <lb/>gift of John Abrams, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), Omi Δ1 , Omi Df1 (Tain et <lb/>al., 2009; Yacobi-Sharon et al., 2013) (a gift of Eli Arama, Weizmann Institute of Science), <lb/>mnk 6006 (Takada et al., 2003) (a gift of William Theurkauf, University of Massachusetts Medical <lb/>School). <lb/>Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy: <lb/>Immunofluorescence staining of testes was performed as described previously (Cheng et <lb/>al., 2008). Briefly, testes were dissected in PBS, transferred to 4% formaldehyde in PBS and <lb/>fixed for 30 minutes. Testes were then washed in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X) for at <lb/>least 60 minutes, followed by incubation with primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin <lb/>(BSA) in PBS-T at 4°C overnight. Samples were washed for 60 minutes (three 20-minute <lb/>washes) in PBS-T, incubated with secondary antibody in 3% BSA in PBS-T at 4°C overnight, <lb/>washed as above, and mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI (Vector Labs). The following <lb/>primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Adducin-like 1B1 (hu-li tai shao -Fly Base) [1:20; <lb/>Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB); developed by H.D. Lipshitz]; mouse anti-<lb/>alpha-spectrin 3A9 (1:20; DSHB; developed by R. Dubreuil, T. Byers); rat anti-vasa (1:50; <lb/>DSHB; developed by A. Spradling), rabbit anti-vasa (1:200; d-26; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), <lb/>mouse anti-Fasciclin III (1:200; DSHB; developed by C. Goodman), anti-LaminDm0 (1:200; <lb/>DSHB; developed by P. A. Fisher), rabbit anti-γ-H2AvD pS137 (1:100;Rockland), rabbit anti-<lb/>mnk (1:100; courtesy of Saeko Takada). Images were taken using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal <lb/>microscope with 63x oil-immersion objectives (NA=1.4) and processed using Adobe Photoshop <lb/>software. For detection of germ cell death, testes were stained with Lysotracker Red DND-99 in <lb/>PBS (1:1000) for 30 minutes prior to formaldehyde fixation. Stages (GB, 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-SGs) <lb/>of dying SGs were identified by counting the number of nuclei within the cyst visualized by <lb/>Lamin Dm0 and DAPI (Chiang et al., 2017). Note that the number of &apos;stageable&apos; dying SGs <lb/>underrepresents the total population of dying SGs, because nuclear structures disintegrate during <lb/>later phases of cell death and make it impossible to count the number of SGs within a dying cyst <lb/>(Chiang et al., 2017). Such &apos;unstageable&apos; SGs were not included in the scoring in this study. <lb/>For observation of unfixed samples, testes were dissected directly into PBS and incubated <lb/>in the dark with the desired dyes for 5 minutes, mounted on slides with PBS and imaged within <lb/>10 minutes of dissection. The dyes used in live imaging are: Lysotracker Red DND-99 (1:200) or <lb/>Lysotracker Green DND-26 (1:200) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Hoechst 33342 (1:200), and <lb/>FM4-64FX in PBS (1:200) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). SG stage (2-, 4-, 8-, or 16-SG) was <lb/></body>

			<body>assessed by number of Hoechst-stained nuclei only when using unfixed samples. Note that the <lb/>scoring of dying SGs is not directly comparable between fixed and unfixed samples (for <lb/>example, results shown in Fig. 1 vs. Fig. 2), due to the difference in the method of SG staging <lb/>and timing. In unfixed samples, SG cysts were staged by the number of Hoechst 33342-positive <lb/>nuclei per cyst marked by FM4-64FX, whereas in fixed samples SG cysts were staged by the <lb/>number of Lamin Dm0-positive nuclei per cyst. <lb/>Ionizing radiation <lb/>For radiation doses of 25-250 rad, a 137 Cs source was used with a dose rate of <lb/>approximately 100 rad per minute. Additionally, for radiation doses 100 rad and above, a Philips <lb/>RT250 model or Kimtron Medical IC-320 orthovoltage unit was used (dose rates of 200 and 400 <lb/>rad per minute respectively). Dosimetry was carried out using an ionization chamber connected <lb/>to an electrometer system directly traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology <lb/>calibration. The relative biological effectiveness of 137 Cs and x-ray sources is comparable at <lb/>lower doses (Fu, Phillips, Heilbron, Ross, &amp; Kane, 1979), and experiments were repeated with <lb/>both sources for 100-250 rad, which yielded essentially the same results irrespective of radiation <lb/>source. <lb/>TUNEL Assay <lb/>Larval heads with imaginal discs attached were dissected from third instar larvae into <lb/>PBS, then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 minutes. Samples were then washed in PBS-<lb/>T (PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X) for at least 20 minutes, transferred to 100% methanol for 6 <lb/>minutes with rocking, and washed again for at least 20 minutes in PBS-T. TUNEL assay was <lb/>then carried out according to manufacturer&apos;s instructions using a Millipore ApopTag Red In Situ <lb/>Apoptosis Detection Kit (S7165). Following washes with PBS-T for 20 minutes, wing imaginal <lb/>discs were dissected from larval heads and mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI (Vector <lb/>Labs). <lb/>Dose-response best fit regressions <lb/>Best fit functions and lines for radiation dose-cell death response curves were generated <lb/>by using GraphPad Prism 7 and the means-only values at all doses. Non-linear regressions were <lb/>determined using a four-parameter logistic curve with no constraints on bottom, top, or hillslope <lb/>and &gt;1500 iterations. Standard linear regression was performed using cell death as a function of <lb/>radiation dose. Goodness of fit, unadjusted R 2 value, was determined by 1.0 less the ratio of the <lb/>regression sum of squares to the total sum of squares, 1 -SS reg /SS tot. <lb/></body>
