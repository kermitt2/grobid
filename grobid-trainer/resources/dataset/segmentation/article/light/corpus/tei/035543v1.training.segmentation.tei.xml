			<front>ABSTRACT <lb/>The qualification of orthology is a significant challenge when developing large, <lb/>multi-loci phylogenetic datasets from assembled transcripts. Transcriptome assemblies <lb/>have various attributes, such as fragmentation, frameshifts, and mis-indexing, which pose <lb/>problems to automated methods of orthology assessment. Here, we identify a set of <lb/>orthologous single-copy genes from transcriptome assemblies for the land snails and slugs <lb/>(Eupulmonata) using a thorough approach to orthology determination involving manual <lb/>alignment curation, gene tree assessment and sequencing from genomic DNA. We <lb/>qualified the orthology of 500 nuclear, protein coding genes from the transcriptome <lb/>assemblies of 21 eupulmonate species to produce the most complete gene data matrix for a <lb/>major molluscan lineage to date, both in terms of taxon and character completeness. Exon-<lb/>capture of the 500 genes for 22 species of Australian Camaenidae successfully captured <lb/>sequences of 2,825 exons, with only a 3.7% reduction in the data matrix due to the <lb/>presence of putative paralogs or pseudogenes. The automated pipeline Agalma retrieved <lb/>the majority of the manually qualified 500 single-copy gene set and identified a further 375 <lb/>putative single-copy genes, although it failed to account for fragmented transcripts <lb/>resulting in lower data matrix completeness. This could potentially explain the minor <lb/>inconsistencies we observed in the supported topologies for the 21 eupulmonate species <lb/>between the manually curated and Agalma-equivalent dataset (sharing 458 genes). Overall, <lb/>our study confirms the utility of the 500 gene set to resolve phylogenetic relationships at a <lb/>broad range of evolutionary depths, and highlights the importance of addressing <lb/>fragmentation at the homolog alignment stage. <lb/></front>

			<body>INTRODUCTION <lb/>Robust and well resolved phylogenies document the evolutionary history of <lb/>organisms and are essential for understanding spatio-temporal patterns of phylogenetic <lb/>diversification and phenotypic evolution. Despite the central role of phylogenies in <lb/>evolutionary biology, most phylogenetic studies in non-model systems have relied on a <lb/>limited number of readily sequenced genes due to cost restrictions and availability of <lb/>phylogenetic markers. However, both theoretical and empirical studies have shown that a <lb/>greater number of independently evolving loci are needed to resolve difficult phylogenetic <lb/>questions (Gontcharov et al. 2004; Wortley et al. 2005; Leaché &amp; Rannala 2011). This <lb/>need has spurred rapid advances in phylogenomics, which capitalise on high-throughput <lb/>sequencing to acquire large multi-loci datasets. In particular, both transcriptome <lb/>sequencing and targeted-enrichment strategies are increasingly being employed to <lb/>reconstruct phylogenetic relationships across a wide range of taxonomic levels (e.g. Bi et <lb/>al. 2012; Lemmon et al. 2012; Faircloth et al. 2012; Zapata et al. 2014; O&apos;Hara et al. 2014; <lb/>Misof et al. 2014). A common aim of these studies, especially targeted enrichment based <lb/>studies, has been to identify universal sets of orthologous loci that can readily be captured <lb/>and sequenced across a broad taxonomic spectrum (e.g. Lemmon et al. 2012; Faircloth et <lb/>al. 2012; Hugall et al. 2015). Obtaining such universal sets of orthologous genes allows for <lb/>consistency and comparison across studies, and ultimately contributes towards a more <lb/>comprehensive Tree of Life (ToL) meta-analysis. <lb/>One of the greatest challenges associated with developing large, multi-loci <lb/>phylogenomic datasets is the qualification of orthology. In the context of phylogenetic <lb/>analysis, genes need to be orthologous and single-copy across all taxa under study (Fitch <lb/>2000; Philippe et al. 2011; Struck 2013). To this end, a number of automated pipelines <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>have been developed to identify single-copy orthologous genes from assembled <lb/>transcriptomes. These methods generally involve two main steps. The first step is to <lb/>identify and cluster homologous sequences, either by direct reference to annotated <lb/>genomes (e.g., O&apos;Hara et al. 2014) or by reference to ortholog databases, which themselves <lb/>are derived from genome comparisons (e.g., Tatusov et al. 2003; Ranwez et al. 2007; <lb/>Waterhouse et al. 2013; Altenhoff et al. 2015). Alternatively, non-reference methods have <lb/>been employed such as all-by-all and reciprocal BLAST comparisons (Li et al. 2003; Dunn <lb/>et al. 2013) followed by clustering (Enright et al. 2002). In the second step, orthology is <lb/>qualified using either similarity based approaches, including best-hit reciprocal blasts <lb/>(Ebersberger et al. 2009; Waterhouse et al. 2013; Ward &amp; Moreno-Hagelsieb 2014), <lb/>and/or tree based methods, where gene trees are used to identify sequences with purely <lb/>orthologous relationships (e.g., Agalma, Dunn et al. 2013; PhyloTreePruner, Kocot et al. <lb/>2013). <lb/>Despite rapid advances in automated approaches to homolog clustering and <lb/>qualifying orthology, there are many characteristics of transcriptome assemblies that <lb/>challenge such automated methods. These include frameshifts, mis-indexing, transcript <lb/>fragmentation and the presence of multiple isoforms. Not accounting for these issues can <lb/>lead to erroneous inclusion of paralogous sequences and/or the inadvertent removal of <lb/>appropriate orthologous sequences (Martin &amp; Burg 2002; Pirie et al. 2007; Philippe et al. <lb/>2011). To address these issues O&apos;Hara et al. (2014) placed greater emphasis on careful <lb/>manual curation and editing of homolog alignments prior to ortholog qualification. A key <lb/>aspect of this approach was the concatenation of transcript fragments into a single <lb/>consensus sequence prior to tree-based ortholog qualification, leading to a more complete <lb/>final data matrix. This, in turn, allowed a more robust probe design for subsequent exon-<lb/></body>

			<body>capture (Hugall et al. 2015). With the same objective of deriving a gene set appropriate for <lb/>exon-capture, here we implement this approach to identify and qualify 500 single-copy <lb/>orthologous genes for the Eupulmonata, a major lineage of air breathing snails and slugs <lb/>within the class Gastropoda. <lb/>Eupulmonata comprises over 24,000 species, with an evolutionary depth spanning <lb/>over 150 million years (Jörger et al. 2010). The evolutionary relationships of the <lb/>Eupulmonata, however, remain incompletely understood despite many morphological and <lb/>molecular phylogenetic studies over the last two decades (e.g., Ponder &amp; Lindberg 1997; <lb/>Wade et al. 2001, 2006; Grande et al. 2004; Dinapoli &amp; Klussmann-Kolb 2010; Holznagel <lb/>et al. 2010; Dayrat et al. 2011). The lack of congruence between studies is largely due to a <lb/>combination of using insufficient genetic markers (Schrödl 2014) and widespread <lb/>morphological convergence (Dayrat &amp; Tillier 2002). Therefore to resolve the &apos;tree of life&apos; <lb/>of the eupulmonates, it is essential to identify more independently evolving markers with a <lb/>greater range of substitution rates to better estimate relationships across all evolutionary <lb/>depths. To achieve this, we sequenced and assembled transcriptomes for representatives of <lb/>15 families across Eupulmonata. We used the owl limpet genome, Lottia gigantea, as a <lb/>reference to identify and cluster homologous sequences and manually curated all homolog <lb/>alignments accounting for transcript fragmentation, mis-indexing and frameshifts. We then <lb/>qualified orthology by assessing individual gene trees and by sequencing the orthologous <lb/>gene set from genomic DNA using target enrichment. Lastly, as a comparison and <lb/>qualification of our approach we also analysed our transcriptome dataset using the fully <lb/>automated orthology determination pipeline Agalma (Dunn et al. 2013). <lb/>METHODS <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>Transcriptome sequencing and assembly <lb/>We sequenced transcriptomes for 21 species of terrestrial snails and slugs <lb/>representative of 15 families across Eupulmonata (Table 1). Total RNA was extracted from <lb/>foot or whole body tissue stored in RNAlater (Ambion Inc, USA) using the Qiagen <lb/>RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Library preparations were conducted <lb/>using the TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), and <lb/>sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (100 bp paired end reads). We used the <lb/>program Trimmomatic v0.22 (Lohse et al. 2012) to remove and trim low quality reads and <lb/>adaptor sequences, and the program Trinity v2012-06-08 (Grabherr et al. 2011; Haas et al. <lb/>2013) with default settings to assemble the transcriptomes. <lb/>Homolog clustering and orthology assessment <lb/>Our approach to homolog clustering and orthology qualification is largely <lb/>consistent with that detailed in O&apos;Hara et al. (2014). A schematic representation of our <lb/>pipeline is provided in Figure 1. To generate clusters of putatively homologous sequences <lb/>we first compared each assembly to the Lottia gigantea predicted gene dataset (hereon <lb/>referred to as the L. gigantea genes) using blastx with an e-value cut off of 1e-10. The L. <lb/>gigantea gene dataset comprises 23,851 filtered gene models annotated in the most current <lb/>draft genome (Grigoriev et al. 2012; Simakov et al. 2013). Only the top hit based on the <lb/>lowest e-value was retained. A relatively relaxed e-value cut-off was used to ensure all <lb/>closely related homologs were assessed. <lb/>We ran an all-by-all BLAST of the L. gigantea gene dataset against itself (blastp, <lb/>cut off e-value of 1e-10) to identify paralogs within the L. gigantea genome, retaining all <lb/>hits. To qualify the all-by-all BLAST results, we also obtained orthology status for all L. <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>gigantea genes classified in the OMA ortholog database (Altenhoff et al. 2015). While this <lb/>information provided guidance, we were not reliant on it when prioritising homolog <lb/>clusters to assess. Specifically, we considered L. gigantea to be sufficiently divergent from <lb/>the eupulmonates (&gt; 400 million years, Zapata et al. 2014) that single copy status could <lb/>differ. To identify candidate single copy genes for the eupulmonates we concatenated the <lb/>BLAST results across all species, including the reference all-by-all BLAST, and sorted this <lb/>by L. gigantea gene. Hence, a homolog cluster is considered here as that containing 1) all <lb/>contigs from all species that had a match to a given reference L. gigantea gene, and 2) all <lb/>contigs having a hit to any of the closely related L. gigantea genes identified by the all-by-<lb/>all BLAST. The resulting clusters were then translated and aligned using ClustalW <lb/>(Thompson et al. 1994), using the program BioEdit (Hall 1999). <lb/>To maintain consistency across studies, we first assessed homolog alignments <lb/>corresponding to the 288 L. gigantea genes used in a phylogenomic study of the Mollusca <lb/>(Kocot et al. 2011). Although there are two other published molluscan phylogenomic <lb/>datasets (Smith et al. 2011; Zapata et al. 2014), we focussed on the final dataset of Kocot <lb/>et al. (2011) as this was well annotated in reference to the L. gigantea gene dataset. After <lb/>qualifying the subset of genes from the Kocot et al. study that were single copy across all <lb/>the eupulmonates considered here, we proceeded to assess and qualify additional homolog <lb/>clusters until we obtained a final set of 500 single-copy orthologous genes. This dataset <lb/>size was chosen to represent a balance between phylogenetic power at varying time scales <lb/>(Leaché &amp; Rannala 2011; Philippe et al. 2011; Lemmon &amp; Lemmon 2013) and a suitable <lb/>size for subsequent exon-capture probe design. Accordingly, we prioritised homolog <lb/>clusters with high taxonomic representation (≥ 18 taxa) as completeness of the data matrix <lb/>is critical for designing baits across multiple lineages (Lemmon et al. 2012; Hugall et al. <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>2015). Where possible we also prioritised genes for which the coding region (CDS) was ≥ <lb/>300bp, or which had at least one exon ≥ 200bp. <lb/>When assessing the orthology of homolog clusters, we only considered the coding <lb/>region (i.e. untranslated regions (UTRs) were removed). We manually corrected <lb/>frameshifts and removed both clearly erroneous sequences (highly divergent with poor <lb/>blast e-values) and redundant sequences (transcripts identical within the aligned coding <lb/>region). Mis-indexing was identified as cases where two sequences for the same region <lb/>were present but one (typically just a fragment) matched exactly the sequence for another <lb/>taxon. Taxa containing paralogs were clearly evident by generally having &gt; 5% <lb/>dissimilarity at the nucleotide level. To further qualify that paralogs were present we <lb/>inspected genealogies constructed using the neighbour joining method in MEGA (see <lb/>Figure S1). Any homolog cluster containing paralogs for any species was excluded from <lb/>further consideration. In certain cases paralogous sequences were closely related, <lb/>representing either in-paralogs (see Remm et al. 2001) or genes exhibiting elevated allelic <lb/>diversity (see O&apos;Hara et al. 2014). These also were excluded from further consideration as <lb/>such genes are not optimal for exon-capture with greater taxonomic sampling. In the case <lb/>of fragmented transcripts, consensus sequences were produced if the overlapping regions <lb/>did not differ by more than three nucleotides. Non-overlapping fragments were also <lb/>concatenated if there were no other competing contigs and they displayed a high degree of <lb/>sequence similarity to closely related taxa. <lb/>As a proxy measure of substitution rate variation across the final 500 gene set we <lb/>calculated uncorrected distances (p-distance) for species pairs within the families <lb/>Rhytididae (Terrycarlessia turbinata and Victaphanta atramentaria) and Camaenidae <lb/>(Sphaerospira fraseri and Austrochloritis kosciuszkoensis). We chose to limit this analysis <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>to intrafamilial comparisons to avoid underestimation due to saturation. For comparison, <lb/>we also calculated the p-distances for two commonly used phylogenetic markers, CO1 and <lb/>28S, for the same taxa. <lb/>Qualification of orthology using TreSpEx <lb/>Although only a single copy of each gene per taxon was present in our final <lb/>ortholog alignments, they may nevertheless be paralogous (see Struck 2014). To <lb/>investigate this we used the program TreSpEx (Struck 2014) to assess genealogies for <lb/>conflict with a priori taxonomic hypotheses. Gene trees for each of the 500 genes were <lb/>constructed using the GTRGAMMA model, codon specific partitioning, and 100 fast <lb/>bootstraps in RAxML (Stamatakis 2006). TreSpEx then searched for well supported <lb/>conflicting phylogenetic signal relative to five distinct and taxonomically well-established <lb/>eupulmonate clades (Limacoidea, Orthurethra, Helicoidea, the Australian Rhytididae <lb/>(Table 1: see Hausdorf 1998; Wade et al. 2006, 2007; Herbert et al. 2015), and the <lb/>Stylommatophora). All nodes with ≥ 75 bootstrap support were assessed for conflict with <lb/>the monophyly of each of the five clades. Strongly supported sister relationships between <lb/>sequences from different clades can indicate the presence of &apos;hidden&apos; paralogous <lb/>sequences. TreSpEx also flags very short terminal branches as indicative of potential cross-<lb/>contamination and internal branches which are five times greater than the average, which, <lb/>in addition to strong nodal support, may indicate paralogy. <lb/>Qualification of orthology using exon-capture <lb/>To further qualify orthology and identify unexpressed paralogs and pseudogenes, <lb/>we designed an exon-capture probe set to enrich and sequence 1,646 exons, representative <lb/>of 490 of the final gene set, from genomic DNA. We used MYbaits (MYcroarray, Ann <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>Arbor, Michigan) custom biotinylated 120bp RNA baits at 2X tiling. We designed the baits <lb/>based on two species of Australian Camaenidae, Sphaerospira fraseri and Austrocholritis <lb/>kosciuszkoensis as a test case as the divergence across the eupulmonates is too large for a <lb/>single probe design. Exon boundaries were delineated as per the L. gigantea genome and <lb/>all exons shorter than 120bp (the probe length) were excluded (ten genes contained only <lb/>exons shorter than 120bp). <lb/>We tested the probe set on 22 species belonging to the family Camaenidae, <lb/>spanning much of the phylogenetic breadth of the Australasian radiation, representing up <lb/>to 30 million years (My) of evolution (Hugall &amp; Stanisic 2011) (Table 2). DNA was <lb/>extracted using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) and sheared using the Covaris <lb/>S2. Libraries where then constructed using the Kapa DNA Library Preparation Kit (Kapa <lb/>Biosystems, USA), modified to accommodate dual-indexing using the i7 and i5 index sets <lb/>(see Hugall et al. 2015). Up to eight libraries (normalised to 100 ng each) were pooled per <lb/>capture, and hybridised to the baits (at one-quarter dilution) for 36 hours, following the <lb/>MYbait protocol v1. A second hybridisation was then carried out on the fragments retained <lb/>from the first hybridisation to further enrich the capture. The captured fragments were <lb/>sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (v2), obtaining 150bp paired-end reads. <lb/>We used FastUniq (Xu et al. 2012) to remove duplicates, and Trimmomatic v0.22 <lb/>(Bolger et al. 2014) to trim and remove low quality reads and adaptor sequences <lb/>(minimum average quality score threshold of 20 per 8nt window). Reads shorter than 40 <lb/>bases after trimming were discarded. The trimmed reads were then mapped onto the <lb/>transcriptome sequences used for the probe design using BFAST (Homer et al. 2009) with <lb/>a single index of 22nt without mismatch. After creating pileup files using Samtools (Li et <lb/>al. 2009), VarScan v2.3.7 (Koboldt et al. 2012) was used to call variants and produce a <lb/></body>

			<page>11 <lb/></page>

			<body>final consensus. To flag potential pseudogenes and paralogs we identified consensus <lb/>sequences with an elevated proportion of variable sites (&gt; 3% heterozygote sites) and <lb/>reviewed the corresponding read alignments (BAM files) using the Integrative Genomics <lb/>Viewer (IGV: Thorvaldsdóttir et al. 2013). All sequences with greater than 3% ambiguous <lb/>sites where removed from the final dataset. Exons where more than 10% of the taxa <lb/>contained greater than 3% ambiguous sites were discarded entirely. <lb/>We again used TreSpEx to assess conflicting phylogenetic signal. We screened for <lb/>hidden paralogs based on five a priori phylogenetic hypotheses representing well <lb/>supported clades within the Australian camaenid radiation as delineated by Hugall and <lb/>Stanisic (2011), namely the Hadroid group (clade 1 -4 inclusive), the far-northern (sister <lb/>clades 5 and 6) and north-eastern (clade 7) Chloritid groups, a group dominated by arid and <lb/>monsoonal camaenids (clade 11) previously recognised as the subfamily Sinumeloninae <lb/>(e.g. Solem 1992), and a phenotypically and ecologically diverse group dominated by <lb/>eastern Australian wet forest taxa (sister clades 8 and 9). Gene trees for each of the 490 <lb/>genes (constituent exons were combined as one partition) were constructed using the <lb/>GTRGAMMA model and 100 fast bootstraps in RAxML (Stamatakis 2006). <lb/>Comparison to the Agalma pipeline <lb/>As an independent qualification of the manually curated 500 gene set we ran the <lb/>fully automated orthology determination pipeline Agalma (Dunn et al. 2013) (Figure 1). <lb/>We commenced this pipeline from the &apos;postassemble&apos; step which first identified open <lb/>reading frames and putative coding regions (Dunn et al. 2013). Homolog clusters were <lb/>then identified using an all-by-all tblastx, followed by clustering using the Markov <lb/>Clustering algorithm (MCL) (Figure 1). Homolog clusters were then translated and aligned <lb/>using MAFFT (Katoh &amp; Standley 2013) and gene trees estimated using RAxML. To <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>identify orthologous sequences, the genealogies were then screened for &apos;optimally <lb/>inclusive subtrees&apos; which contain only a single representative of each species. Multiple <lb/>orthologous subtrees can be delineated per homolog cluster, potentially allowing paralogs <lb/>to be separated and retained. The surviving subtrees were filtered based on the number of <lb/>taxa (set to greater than four taxa) and realigned for subsequent phylogenetic analysis. <lb/>Phylogenetic analysis <lb/>We reconstructed maximum likelihood trees using the program RAxML <lb/>(Stamatakis 2006) for datasets resulting from both the manual curation and the Agalma <lb/>pipeline. PartitionFinder (Lanfear et al. 2012) was used to identify suitable models and <lb/>partitioning schemes, implemented with 1% heuristic r-cluster searches, optimized <lb/>weighting, RAxML likelihood calculations, and model selection based on BIC scores. In <lb/>all cases, nodal support was assessed by performing 100 thorough bootstraps. We analysed <lb/>two datasets resulting from the Agalma pipeline. The first dataset comprised ortholog <lb/>clusters that corresponded to the manually curated 500 gene set (here on referred to as the <lb/>Agalma equivalent dataset). The second dataset consisted of all ortholog clusters which <lb/>had high taxon coverage (≥18), and were derived from homolog clusters containing only a <lb/>single ortholog cluster (from here on referred to as the Agalma best dataset); that is, <lb/>Agalma homolog clusters containing multiple copies, albeit diagnosable, were not <lb/>considered further. <lb/>We also reconstructed a phylogeny for the camaenid dataset obtained through <lb/>exon-capture and included sequences from the five camaenid transcriptomes presented <lb/>herein, as well as sequences of Cornu aspersum as an outgroup. In the case of the manually <lb/>curated transcriptome dataset, regions difficult to align across all taxa were manually <lb/>masked out. Gblocks (Castresana 2000) was used to remove any additional regions of <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>ambiguous alignments from the manually curated dataset as well as the exon-capture data <lb/>matrix. <lb/>RESULTS <lb/>Transcriptome assembly and homolog clustering <lb/>The number of paired reads obtained for each of the 21 eupulmonate species <lb/>sequenced ranged from 7.8M to 31.6M (Table 3). Trimming and de novo assembly <lb/>statistics are presented in Table 3. The number of L. gigantea reference genes with BLAST <lb/>matches ranged from 7,011 to 9,699 per assembly (Table 3), 5,490 of which had <lb/>homologous sequences in at least 18 of the 21 transcriptome assemblies. <lb/>Of the 288 genes used in a previous molluscan phylogenomic study (Kocot et al. <lb/>2011) 130 were single-copy for all eupulmonates considered here, while 146 contained <lb/>paralogs in at least one species (mean p-distance between paralogs of 0.28, ranging from <lb/>0.16-0.46). We could not unambiguously qualify the remaining 12 genes from this study as <lb/>they were poorly represented in our transcriptomes. Prioritising genes with high taxon <lb/>coverage and long exon length, we assessed alignments of candidate homolog clusters until <lb/>we reached 500 single-copy genes. In addition to the 146 Kocot genes shown to be <lb/>paralogous within the eupulmonates, we identified and qualified 62 multi-copy genes <lb/>during the course of this work. The final single-copy gene set is 98.5% taxa complete (i.e. <lb/>sequence present for each gene and taxon) and 93.1% character complete (Figure 4d), with <lb/>an average gene length of 1,190nt, ranging from 228nt to 6,261nt. In total, the final <lb/>alignment of this gene set represents 512,958nt. Approximately 12% of the sequences in <lb/>the final gene-by-species matrix were derived by concatenating fragmented transcripts. <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>Based on the all-by-all BLAST of the L. gigantea genes, 347 of our final 500 genes <lb/>had a single hit at an e-value threshold of 1e-10 (i.e. single copy status was consistent <lb/>between the L. gigantea reference and the eupulmonates), while the remainder had <lb/>multiple hits, indicative of the presence of close paralogs in the reference. Conversely, of <lb/>the 208 genes qualified as multiple-copy for the eupulmonates (146 from the Kocot gene <lb/>set plus 62 from this study), 134 only had one hit within the L. gigantea gene set (i.e. just <lb/>over half of the multiple-copy gene set are potentially single copy for patellogastropods). <lb/>These results broadly correspond to the orthology designation in the OMA (Orthologous <lb/>MAtrix) database. <lb/>Across the 500 single-copy genes, the p-distance between the two rhytidids, <lb/>Terrycarlessia turbinata and Victaphanta atramentaria, ranged from 0.02 to 0.13 (average <lb/>of 0.06; Figure 3). This family is thought to have originated 120 Mya (Bruggen 1980; <lb/>Upchurch 2008). However, the Australian rhytidids probably represent a more recent <lb/>radiation (Herbert et al. 2015, Moussalli and Herbert 2016). Similarly, p-distance between <lb/>the two camaenids, Sphaerospira fraseri and Austrochloritis kosciuszkoensis, ranged from <lb/>0.01 to 0.13 (average of 0.04). This group is thought to have originated in the Oligo-<lb/>Miocene approximately 30 Mya (Hugall &amp; Stanisic 2011). All genes had a higher relative <lb/>substitution rate than the commonly used phylogenetic marker 28S, and were on average <lb/>approximately four times slower than COI (Figure 3). <lb/>Orthology qualification using TreSpEx <lb/>TreSpEx analyses of all 500 genes found no well supported conflict with the a <lb/>priori phylogenetic hypotheses, suggesting that hidden paralogs (i.e., genes represented by <lb/>a single sequence per taxon yet paralogous across multiple taxa) were absent from our <lb/></body>

			<body>dataset. Furthermore, this analysis also showed no evidence of cross sample contamination, <lb/>nor any evidence of suspect long internal branches within the Stylommatophora. <lb/>Qualification of orthology using exon-capture <lb/>We enriched and sequenced all 1,646 targeted exons when considering all 22 <lb/>samples collectively. We first mapped reads to the original reference used in the probe <lb/>design with exon boundaries delineated based on the L. gigantea genome. Examination of <lb/>the resulting read alignments (BAM files) identified 437 reference exons which contained <lb/>multiple internal exon boundaries within the Camaenidae (Figure S4). Accordingly, the <lb/>mapping reference was modified to account for exon-splitting (including the removal of <lb/>163 exons that were shorter than 40 bp after splitting), with the final revised reference <lb/>comprising 2,648 exons representing 417,846nt (Supplementary Table 1). <lb/>We then remapped reads to the revised reference (coverage and specificity statistics <lb/>presented in Table 4) and flagged resulting consensus sequences which exhibited elevated <lb/>polymorphism (&gt; 3% heterozygote sites). There were 508 exons where at least one taxon <lb/>exhibited elevated polymorphism. Of these, 105 exons had greater than 10% of the taxa <lb/>(typically two or more taxa, taking into account missing taxa) exhibiting elevated <lb/>polymorphism. Based on an examination of the corresponding read alignments (i.e. BAM <lb/>files), 95 exons were classified as having lineage specific pseudogenes or paralogs, four <lb/>contained evidence of processed pseudogenes, and six where the alignment was <lb/>complicated by the mapping of unrelated reads containing small, highly similar domains <lb/>(see Figure S4-S8 for examples of each case). These 105 exons were removed prior to <lb/>phylogenetic analyses. For the remaining 403 exons only the consensus sequences for the <lb/>taxa with elevated polymorphism were removed from the final alignment. In total, 3.7% of <lb/></body>

			<page>16 <lb/></page>

			<body>the sequences were removed from final data matrix due to elevated polymorphism. The <lb/>final data matrix was 98% taxa complete and 95% character complete. <lb/>Based on the TreSpEx analyses, four genes did not support the monophyly of the <lb/>&apos;Far North Chloritid&apos; group, but rather placed (Nannochloritis layardi and Patrubella <lb/>buxtoni) as sister to the &apos;North-East Chloritid&apos; group (Figure 5). We concluded that this <lb/>was not the result of hidden paralogy, but rather due to insufficient lineage sorting of <lb/>relatively conserved genes. An additional five genes were in conflict with the a priori <lb/>taxonomic hypotheses, however, these represented cases where the genes were small and <lb/>the proportion of phylogenetically informative sites was low. Five genes were flagged as <lb/>having at least one internal branch which was greater than five times the average. <lb/>Assessment of the alignments and corresponding genealogies indicated that they <lb/>represented deep basal divergence between well supported major clades, and was not <lb/>reflective of hidden paralogy. <lb/>Finally, we enriched another representative of Sphaerospira fraseri, one of the <lb/>reference species used in the probe design. Comparing the mapped consensus genomic <lb/>sequence to the transcriptome reference we found only minor mismatch, reflective of <lb/>intraspecific variation as the two samples came from different populations. Furthermore, <lb/>for this species at least, all reference genes constructed from multiple transcript fragments <lb/>were consistent with those captured from genomic DNA (i.e. chimeras of unrelated <lb/>fragments were not created). <lb/>Comparison to Agalma pipeline <lb/>Using the Agalma pipeline we identified 11,140 ortholog clusters. Of these <lb/>ortholog clusters 635 corresponded to 457 of our 500 single-copy gene set. We refer to this <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>dataset as the &quot;Agalma equivalent&quot; dataset, and is 61% taxa complete and 54% character <lb/>complete. Many of the genes were represented by multiple ortholog clusters in the Agalma <lb/>analysis, many of which contained fewer taxa relative to that obtained via manual curation <lb/>(Figure 3). Rather than paralogs, in all cases fragmentation in the transcriptome assemblies <lb/>resulted in the splitting of homolog clusters into multiple ortholog clusters, each <lb/>representing the same locus but containing a different subset of taxa (see example in Figure <lb/>S3). Of the 43 single-copy genes not picked up by Agalma, five were not annotated in the <lb/>&apos;postassemble&apos; step, 12 were annotated but not recovered by the all-by-all BLAST, 18 <lb/>were recovered by the all-by-all BLAST but dropped during the clustering step, and eight <lb/>made it to the initial clusters but failed the alignment and trimming step prior to the gene <lb/>tree reconstruction. Failure to recover these genes during the BLAST comparison, <lb/>clustering and alignment steps is most likely due to a combination of frameshift errors and <lb/>transcript fragmentation, and in certain cases, resulting in the taxon sampling threshold and <lb/>cluster size criteria not being met. <lb/>Of the 11,140 ortholog clusters there were 546 clusters that contained sequences of <lb/>at least 18 taxa and that had one ortholog cluster per homolog cluster. Of these, 171 were <lb/>also contained in our 500 single-copy gene set. Hence, the Agalma pipeline identified 375 <lb/>genes in addition to the 500 manually curated genes, which had optimum taxon sampling. <lb/>The majority of these genes also represented the full CDS with 89% representing at least <lb/>80% of the length of the respective L. gigantea gene. We refer to this dataset as the <lb/>&quot;Agalma best&quot; dataset and is 92% taxa complete and 85% character complete. <lb/>Phylogenetic analysis <lb/>We reconstructed phylogenies from three ortholog datasets for comparison: (1) the <lb/>manually curated 500 single-copy gene set (Figure 4a, d), (2) the Agalma equivalent <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>dataset consisting of 635 orthologous clusters which corresponded to 457 of the 500 <lb/>single-copy genes (Figure 4b, e), and (3) the Agalma best dataset consisting of 546 <lb/>orthologous clusters which had 18 or more taxa and were the only orthologous cluster from <lb/>the respective homolog cluster (Figure 4c, f). Of the manual curated dataset, 1.6% of the <lb/>alignment was removed by Gblocks prior to phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenies for the <lb/>500 single-copy gene set and the Agalma best dataset had identical topologies, supporting <lb/>all major clades with very high bootstrap support, namely Helicoidea, Limacoidea, <lb/>Orthurethra, the Australian rhytidids and the Stylommatophora (Figure 4a, c). In terms of <lb/>phylogenetic relationships, the Rhytididae forms a sister relationship with the Limacoidea, <lb/>and the Helicoidea occupies a basal position within Stylommatophora. In contrast, while <lb/>also supporting the monophyly of all major clades, the phylogeny based on the &apos;Agalma <lb/>equivalent&apos; dataset places Orthurethra in a basal position within Stylommatophora, (Figure <lb/>4b). <lb/>Of the Camaenidae exon catpture dataset, 5% of the alignment was removed by <lb/>Gblocks prior to phylogenetic analysis. The resulting phylogeny supported all major <lb/>groups previously recognised by Hugall and Stanisic (2011). In terms of phylogenetic <lb/>relationships, the two Chloritid groups formed a clade with the Hadroid group, with the <lb/>Far-northern chloritids sister to the hadroids. There was poor resolution regarding the <lb/>phylogenetic positions of the two remaining groups, the Eastern rainforests and the arid <lb/>and monsoonal NW Australian clades (Figure 5). <lb/>DISCUSSION <lb/>The identification and qualification of orthology is a critical prerequisite for sound <lb/>phylogenetic inference. Our approach of orthology assessment involved an initial <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>assessment and manual editing of homolog clusters, allowing us to correct for multiple <lb/>isoforms and errors such as sequence fragmentation, frame-shifts and mis-indexing. Using <lb/>this approach, we qualified the orthology and single-copy status of 500 genes across the <lb/>eupulmonates, 130 of which were used in a previous phylogenomic study of the Mollusca <lb/>(Kocot et al. 2011). The resulting 500 gene data matrix is the most complete produced for <lb/>a major molluscan lineage to date, both in terms of taxon and character completeness. We <lb/>further qualified orthology by capturing and sequencing 490 of the 500 genes from <lb/>genomic DNA, revealing the presence of paralogs and/or pseudogenes otherwise not <lb/>evident from the transcriptome data. Although the automated pipeline Agalma recovered <lb/>the majority of the 500 genes as single copy and identified 375 additional putatively <lb/>orthologous genes for the eupulmonates, it was hampered by fragmentation within the <lb/>assemblies. Furthermore, supported topologies for the 21 eupulmonate species were not <lb/>entirely consistent between the manually curated and Agalma equivalent dataset, <lb/>potentially a consequence of lower data matrix completeness in the latter. We discuss <lb/>approaches to ortholog determination and implications for phylogenetic inference below. <lb/>Ortholog determination <lb/>To date, transcriptome based phylogenomic studies have focused on resolving <lb/>relatively deep evolutionary relationships (e.g. Kocot et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011; Zapata <lb/>et al. 2014; O&apos;Hara et al. 2014; Misof et al. 2014), and a number have relied on annotated <lb/>ortholog databases such as OMA (Altenhoff et al. 2015) and OrthoDB (Waterhouse et al. <lb/>2013) for the initial screening of suitable genes. Such databases are typically limited in the <lb/>number of representatives per lineage (e.g., Tatusov et al. 2003; Ranwez et al. 2007; <lb/>Waterhouse et al. 2013; Altenhoff et al. 2015). Nevertheless, it is a reasonable assumption <lb/>that orthologous genes qualified as single-copy across many highly divergent taxa are more <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>likely to maintain single-copy status with greater taxonomic sampling. We tested this idea <lb/>at a preliminary stage of our work by first assessing genes used in a phylogenomic study of <lb/>the Mollusca (Kocot et al. 2011). In that study, orthologous genes were identified using the <lb/>program HaMStR, based on a 1,032 ortholog set resulting from the Inparanoid orthology <lb/>database (Ostlund et al. 2010). We found that just under half of the genes used in Kocot et <lb/>al. (2011) were paralogous within the eupulmonates. To some extent the high proportion of <lb/>the Kocot et al. gene set being paralogous is due to the limited representation of <lb/>eupulmonates in that study, and for these few taxa paralogs may have been absent. <lb/>Alternatively, in such deep phylogenomic studies lineage-specific duplication may have <lb/>manifested as in-paralogs and were dealt with by retaining one copy from the in-paralog <lb/>set at random (Kocot et al. 2011; Dunn et al. 2013) or based on sequence similarity <lb/>(Ebersberger et al. 2009). However, with an increase in taxonomic sampling, such <lb/>paralogy may extend across multiple taxa, and unless isorthology can be qualified (Fitch <lb/>2000), these genes would no longer be suitable for phylogenetic analysis. <lb/>When the 500 gene set was compared to the OMA database (Altenhoff et al. 2015), <lb/>which at the time of this analysis only incorporated a single molluscan genome, namely L. <lb/>gigantea, we found a similarly high proportion of eupulmonate specific paralogy. A more <lb/>interesting result arising from this comparison, however, was that many genes classified as <lb/>having putative paralogs in L. gigantea were single-copy across the eupulmonates. We <lb/>cannot ascertain at this stage whether this is a consequence of duplication being derived <lb/>within Patellogastropoda, the lineage containing L. gigantea, or the consequence of <lb/>duplicate loss in the ancestral eupulmonate. Nevertheless, this result highlights that <lb/>potentially suitable genes may be overlooked when restricted to ortholog database <lb/>designations, especially when such databases have poor representation of the relevant <lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>lineage. Accordingly, although we used the L. gigantea gene set as a reference with which <lb/>to identify and cluster homologous sequences, we did not rely on orthology database <lb/>designations of the L. gigantea gene set to guide our analyses. <lb/>Automated vs manually curated aided pipelines <lb/>Pipelines that fully automate homology searches and clustering, orthology <lb/>qualification, and final alignments are highly desirable for efficiency, consistency, and <lb/>repeatability. Moreover, reference free methods, like that implemented in Agalma are also <lb/>highly desirable in cases where the study taxa are poorly represented in ortholog databases. <lb/>There are characteristics of assembled transcriptome sequences, however, that challenge <lb/>fully automated methods, including fragmentation, mis-indexing and frameshifts, and these <lb/>aspects necessitate careful manual appraisal and editing (Philippe et al. 2011; O&apos;Hara et al. <lb/>2014). Although recent phylogenomic studies have, to varying degrees, incorporated <lb/>manual appraisal, such checks are typically conducted at the final proofing stage (e.g. <lb/>Kocot et al. 2011; Simmons &amp; Goloboff 2014). In this study, we purposefully addressed <lb/>the abovementioned issues at an early stage following the initial alignment of homologous <lb/>sequences. The most important aspect of our manual curation was the creation of <lb/>consensus sequences from fragmented transcripts (see also: O&apos;Hara et al. 2014), which in <lb/>turn ensured maximum retention of data and placed subsequent orthology assessment on a <lb/>sounder footing. Consequently, our final data matrix was highly complete. <lb/>The Agalma analysis confirmed the single-copy, orthology status for the majority <lb/>of the 500 manually curated gene set, but it was hampered by fragmentation within the <lb/>transcriptome assemblies. In all cases where multiple ortholog clusters were derived using <lb/>Agalma for any one of the 500 genes, this was due to fragmentation, not missed paralogy. <lb/>In essence, alignments of fragmented transcripts (whether or not they were partially <lb/></body>

			<page>22 <lb/></page>

			<body>overlapping) resulted in poorly reconstructed gene trees, which in turn misled subsequent <lb/>tree pruning and ortholog clustering (e.g. Figure S3). Consequently, for the Agalma <lb/>equivalent dataset, both taxon and character completeness was poor relative to the <lb/>manually curated data matrix. To our knowledge, no fully automated phylogenomics <lb/>pipeline currently implements the consensus of fragmented sequences, and studies that <lb/>have made the effort to retain multiple fragments, as in this study, have decided which <lb/>sequences to retain and merge manually (e.g., Rothfels et al. 2013; O&apos;Hara et al. 2014). <lb/>The issue of working with fragmented assemblies can be addressed, however, by <lb/>incorporating an automated consensus making algorithm such as TGICL (Pertea et al. <lb/>2003) into the pipeline to address fragmentation at the homolog alignment stage. Doing so <lb/>is particularly desirable, given that manual curation of homologous sequences requires <lb/>considerable time investment. <lb/>A major strength of automated pipelines is that they enable a more comprehensive <lb/>screening of putative orthologous genes. Manual curation requires considerable effort, and <lb/>while more candidate genes were identified than were assessed, we stopped the manual <lb/>assessment once our target of 500 genes had been attained. The Agalma analyses had no <lb/>constraints, however, hence all possible orthologous clusters were considered. <lb/>Consequently, we identified an additional 375 ortholog clusters which met a strict taxa <lb/>completeness threshold (18 taxa or more) and represented the only ortholog cluster arising <lb/>from original homolog clusters. While beyond the scope of this study, further qualification <lb/>of these additional genes using exon-capture (see below) would be highly desirable. <lb/>Phylogenetic inference <lb/>The 500 gene set represents a significant contribution towards advancing molecular <lb/>phylogenetics of the eupulmonates, providing the capacity to resolve both evolutionary <lb/></body>

			<page>23 <lb/></page>

			<body>relationships at shallow to moderate depths, and deep basal relationships. The phylogenetic <lb/>reconstructions presented here are well resolved and support the a priori taxonomic <lb/>hypotheses used as part of the orthology assessment. In terms of deeper relationships, <lb/>reconstructions based on the two most complete datasets are consistent, namely the <lb/>monophyly of Stylommatophora, within which Helicoidea is basal, and the sister <lb/>relationship between the Rhytidoidea and the Limacoidea. For the less complete Agalma <lb/>equivalent dataset, however, Orthurethra is basal within Stylommatophora, albeit with <lb/>marginal support. Without greater taxonomic sampling of all the major lineages within the <lb/>eupulmonates, however, a comprehensive phylogenetic assessment is beyond the scope of <lb/>this study. Nevertheless, these phylogenomic datasets do afford greater resolution of <lb/>deeper relationships than obtained in previous molecular studies (Wade et al. 2001, 2006). <lb/>Secondly, convergence in supported topology between the two most complete and largely <lb/>independent datasets (only 171 genes were in common), and the inconsistency between the <lb/>manually curated and Agalma equivalent dataset (sharing 458 genes), suggests the possible <lb/>importance of data matrix completeness in resolving short, basal internodes. <lb/>Exon-capture <lb/>One of the overarching objectives of this study was to identify and qualify 500 <lb/>genes suitable for exon-capture work within the eupulmonates. Here we sequenced and <lb/>analysed a small dataset for the family Camaenidae principally as a means to further <lb/>qualify orthology. There are two principle outcomes from this exploration. First, for all <lb/>reference sequences based on the concatenation of fragmented transcripts, there was no <lb/>evidence that erroneous chimeric sequences were created. Second, as was the case with the <lb/>increased sampling in the transcriptome work, the pervasiveness of lineage-specific <lb/>duplication was also evident from the exon-capture experiment. Despite qualification of <lb/></body>

			<page>24 <lb/></page>

			<body>single-copy orthology of the transcriptome dataset, increased taxonomic sampling within <lb/>the family Camaenidae revealed lineage-specific duplication for potentially as high as one <lb/>fifth of the targeted exons. In the great majority of cases, however, a very small proportion <lb/>of taxa exhibited putative paralogy, and removal of the affected exon per taxon only <lb/>reduced the completeness of the final dataset by 3.7%. Similar results were achieved in the <lb/>brittle stars with 1.5% of their target discarded due to putative paralogs or pseudogenes <lb/>(Hugall et al. 2015). <lb/>Within the Australian Camaenidae, uncorrected distances for the majority of the <lb/>genes did not exceed 13%. This level of sequence variability is within the range of <lb/>mismatch that is tolerated by in-solution exon-capture protocols (Bi et al. 2012; Bragg et <lb/>al. 2015; Hugall et al. 2015). This was qualified here given the high proportion of target <lb/>recovery (&gt;95%) across a broad representation of the camaenid diversity. As was the case <lb/>for the Euplumonata phylogeny presented above, our preliminary phylogenomic dataset for <lb/>camaenids provides considerable resolution, particularly among the chloritis and hadroid <lb/>groups which to date have been difficult to resolve (Hugall &amp; Stanisic 2011). <lb/>Expanding the bait design to enrich across the Australasian camaenid radiation, <lb/>indeed the family Helicoidea, would require the incorporation of multiple divergent <lb/>reference taxa into the bait design. Recent &quot;anchored enrichment&quot; approaches to bait <lb/>design (e.g. Lemmon et al. 2012; Faircloth et al. 2012) target highly conserved regions to <lb/>allow capture across highly divergent taxa. By contrast, the approach taken here is to target <lb/>both conserved and highly variable regions, and where possible the full coding region (Bi <lb/>et al. 2012; Bragg et al. 2015; Hugall et al. 2015), requiring substantially greater reference <lb/>diversity to be incorporated into the bait design relative to the anchored approach to <lb/>capture across highly divergent lineages (e.g. across families). Recently, Hugall et al. <lb/></body>

			<page>25 <lb/></page>

			<body>(2015) used a similar approach to the one in the present study, but designed baits based on <lb/>ancestral sequences, rather than representative tip taxa, to reduce the overall size of the <lb/>reference set. Using this approach, Hugall et al. successfully enriched and sequenced both <lb/>conserved and highly variable exons across the entire echinoderm class Ophiuroidea, <lb/>spanning approximately 260 million years. Here we have presented a simple bait design <lb/>targeting a specific family, but our transcriptome dataset could be used to produce a more <lb/>diverse bait design to facilitate a more comprehensive study of Eupulmonata phylogenetics <lb/>and systematics. <lb/></body>
