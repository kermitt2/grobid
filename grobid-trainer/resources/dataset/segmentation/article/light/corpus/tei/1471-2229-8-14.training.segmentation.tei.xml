In common with many other polyploids, it seems that a severe genetic bottle-neck <lb/>was imposed at the species origin, via hybridisation of two wild species and spontaneous <lb/>chromosome duplication. Therefore, the study of the genome of peanut is hampered both by the <lb/>crop&apos;s low genetic diversity and its polyploidy. In contrast to cultivated peanut, most wild Arachis <lb/> species are diploid with high genetic diversity. The study of diploid Arachis genomes is therefore <lb/>attractive, both to simplify the construction of genetic and physical maps, and for the isolation and <lb/>characterization of wild alleles. The most probable wild ancestors of cultivated peanut are A. <lb/>duranensis and A. ipaënsis with genome types AA and BB respectively. <lb/> Results: We constructed and characterized two large-insert libraries in Bacterial Artificial <lb/>Chromosome (BAC) vector, one for each of the diploid ancestral species. The libraries (AA and <lb/>BB) are respectively c. 7.4 and c. 5.3 genome equivalents with low organelle contamination and <lb/>average insert sizes of 110 and 100 kb. Both libraries were used for the isolation of clones <lb/>containing genetically mapped legume anchor markers (single copy genes), and resistance gene <lb/>analogues. <lb/> Conclusion: These diploid BAC libraries are important tools for the isolation of wild alleles <lb/>conferring resistances to biotic stresses, comparisons of orthologous regions of the AA and BB <lb/>genomes with each other and with other legume species, and will facilitate the construction of a <lb/>physical map. <lb/>

			<body> Background <lb/> Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L) is the second-most <lb/>important grain legume crop worldwide after soybean, <lb/>with a production of 33 million tons in 2003/04 [1]. Pea-<lb/>nut is produced throughout the tropics and warmer <lb/>regions of the subtropics, but is particularly important in <lb/>Africa, Asia and in the United States [1]. It is an allotetra-<lb/>ploid (AABB) of recent origin that arose from hybridiza-<lb/>tion of two wild species and spontaneous chromosome <lb/>duplication [2,3]. This polyploidization event gave rise to <lb/>a severe genetic bottle-neck [2,3] which has led to lack of <lb/>variability in some important traits, limited availability of <lb/>allelic combinations and consequently restrictions in pro-<lb/>ductivity. In addition, the very low level of polymorphism <lb/>in cultivated peanut has hampered genetic and genomic <lb/>characterization. In contrast, diploid wild relatives of pea-<lb/>nut have high genetic diversity and have been selected <lb/>during evolution in a range of environments and biotic <lb/>stresses, constituting a rich source of allele diversity [3]. <lb/>Wild alleles can be introduced into the gene-pool of culti-<lb/>vated peanut using a &quot;resynthesis&quot; pathway, essentially <lb/>artificially recreating events similar to those that gave rise <lb/>to the origin of the crop species [4]. Recent advances in the <lb/>knowledge of the relationships of wild and cultivated <lb/>genomes through traditional taxonomy, cytogenetics and <lb/>molecular studies are enabling new choices of wild species <lb/>for resynthesis [5-8]. In parallel new genetic and genomic <lb/>tools (see below) for monitoring the introgression of wild <lb/>genes into a cultivated background are opening the per-<lb/>spectives for the efficient introgression of wild genes into <lb/>the peanut crop using molecular breeding. <lb/>The very low level of polymorphism in cultivated peanut <lb/>has hampered genetic mapping and QTL (Quantitative <lb/>trait loci) studies. Consequently only a few linkage maps <lb/>have been published. All of them have used wild species <lb/>to enable the generation of sufficient polymorphic mark-<lb/>ers. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) <lb/>maps were developed by Halward based on a cross of two <lb/>AA genome species, A. stenosperma Krapov. &amp; WC Gregory <lb/>and A. cardenasii Krapov. &amp; WC Gregory, and a tetraploid <lb/>map based on a cross of TxAG-6 (a synthetic amphiploid) <lb/>and A. hypogaea was published by Burow et al. [9]. <lb/>Recently, we developed an SSR-based map for the AA <lb/>genome of Arachis based on a cross of A. stenosperma and <lb/> A. duranensis Krapov. &amp; WC Gregory [10] and a map of the <lb/>BB genome, based on a cross of A. ipaënsis Krapov., WC <lb/>Gregory &amp; CE Simpson and A. magna Krapov., WC Gre-<lb/>gory &amp; CE Simpson [11]. Currently there are 54,168 ESTs <lb/>for A. hypogaea in Genbank [12-14], and 6,264 for the <lb/>wild AA genome A. stenosperma [15,16]. <lb/>Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) libraries are fun-<lb/>damental tools for genomic studies, being important for <lb/>physical mapping, map-based gene cloning and analysis <lb/>of gene structure and function. The easy handling and <lb/>propagation of the clones, their relatively stability and <lb/>low degree of chimerism compared with yeast artificial <lb/>chromosome (YAC) vectors have made BAC vectors the <lb/>cloning system of choice [17,18]. A number of strategies <lb/>have been proposed for physical mapping with large-<lb/>insert clones: hybridisation-based methods such as inter-<lb/>active hybridisation using individual cDNA or genomic <lb/>clones as probes [19], restriction-based fingerprinting <lb/>methods [20] integrated BAC end sequencing and finger-<lb/>print analysis [21] or more recently, the use of oligonucle-<lb/>otide-based &quot;overgos&quot; [22]. <lb/>Within the Leguminosae, BAC libraries are available for <lb/> Phaseolus vulgaris [23], Vigna radiata [24], Glycine max [25], <lb/> Trifolium pretense [26] and the model legumes Lotus japon-<lb/>icus [27] and Medicago truncatula [28]. Within the genus <lb/> Arachis, one BAC library for the allopolyploid cultivated <lb/>peanut has been developed [29]. As a complement to this <lb/>resource, here we describe the production of BAC libraries <lb/>for the two diploid wild species A. duranensis (AA <lb/>genome) and A. ipaënsis (BB genome) that have been <lb/>identified as the most probable ancestors of cultivated <lb/>peanut [8,30]. Using whole genome in-situ hybridization <lb/>(GISH) we also further investigated the affinities and cov-<lb/>erage of the selected diploid genomes compared to those <lb/>present in A. hypogaea. <lb/> Results <lb/> In-situ hybridizations <lb/> Total genomic DNA of A. duranensis (AA genome) and A. <lb/>ipaënsis (BB genome) when used as probes on the chro-<lb/>mosomes of A. hypogaea displayed intense and uniform <lb/>hybridization patterns onto AA and BB chromosomes of <lb/> A. hypogaea respectively (Fig. 1). This clear genome dis-<lb/>crimination of the chromosome subsets from the corre-<lb/>sponding parental genomes in the tetraploids was <lb/>possible without the need of any unlabelled blocking <lb/>DNA, which is normally used to avoid cross-hybridization <lb/>between a specific probe from one genome and homolo-<lb/>gous DNA sequences from another genome. Counter-<lb/>stained A and B chromosomes show very similar total <lb/>sizes for the two genomic components (Fig. 1). <lb/> High Molecular Weight (HMW) DNA isolation <lb/> The use of standard HMW DNA isolation protocols <lb/>[31,32] did not produce sufficient amounts of good qual-<lb/>ity nuclei for Arachis. High levels of carbohydrate and <lb/>polyphenols are present in both A. duranensis and A. <lb/>ipaënsis leaves. This results in high viscosity leaf extracts, <lb/>which are difficult to filtrate, increasing considerably the <lb/>time of the nuclei exposure to the action of oxidizing sub-<lb/>stances. To overcome this problem, some modifications <lb/>were necessary: inclusion of PVP-40 in the extraction <lb/>buffer, filtration of leaf extracts in four layers of cheese-<lb/>

			cloth followed by two layers of Miracloth, centrifugation <lb/>at low speed (60 × g for 2 min) and a Percoll gradient <lb/>(37.5%). The analysis of the extracts by DAPI-staining <lb/>microscopy enabled the correct evaluation of the amount <lb/>and quality of the nuclei preparations. <lb/>The inclusion of an extra purification step, consisting of <lb/>PFGE of agarose plugs for 40 min before digestion, ena-<lb/>bled the purging of smaller fragments and eliminated <lb/>impurities, increasing cloning efficiency. To obtain the <lb/>highest amount of restricted DNA after electro-elution, <lb/>only 50 μL was recovered at the very bottom of the collec-<lb/>tion tube instead of 300 μL as described in the standard <lb/>protocol [21]. After the double size selection, various <lb/>ratios of ligation were tested with the 1/4 V/I ratio result-<lb/>ing in the greatest number of transformants. Overall, five <lb/>different ligations were necessary to obtain each BAC <lb/>library (Table 1). <lb/> BAC libraries characterisation <lb/> The BAC library for the AA genome (A. duranensis) con-<lb/>tained 84,096 clones whilst the BB genome library (A. <lb/> ipaënsis) consisted of 75,648 (Table 1). A random sample <lb/>of each library was analyzed by NotI digestion, and the <lb/>average insert size was 110 and 100 kb for A. duranensis <lb/> and A. ipaënsis respectively (Fig. 2a and 2b; Fig. 3). <lb/>The organelle contamination in both BAC libraries was <lb/>evaluated by screening the high-density filters with mito-<lb/>chondrial and chloroplast specific probes. For A. duranen-<lb/>sis, the contamination of BAC clones with chloroplast <lb/>sequences was of 0.016% and mitochondrial sequences of <lb/>0.21%. For A. ipaënsis 0.363% was contaminated with <lb/>chloroplast sequences and 0.081% of the clones with <lb/>mitochondrial DNA. These values, together with the <lb/>microscopic DAPI-staining observations, reflect the high <lb/>level of purification of the Arachis nuclei obtained with <lb/>the modified protocol. <lb/>Based on the library average insert size and A. duranensis <lb/> haploid genome, equivalent to 1260 Mb [33], the esti-<lb/>mated coverage of the AA genome BAC library is of 7.4 <lb/>haploid genome equivalents. However, for A. ipaënsis, the <lb/>DNA-content determination is controversial. It is possible <lb/>that the haploid genome equivalent of 2,830 Mb reported <lb/>by Singh et al [34] is a 2.0 fold overestimate because of <lb/>measurement inconsistencies, as already described for <lb/>other Arachis species [33,35] Therefore the BB genome <lb/>BAC library for A. ipaënsis could represent from 2.7 to 5.3 <lb/>the haploid genome equivalents of the species. Consider-<lb/>ing that A and B chromosomes show very similar sizes for <lb/>the two genomic components of the tetraploid (as men-<lb/>tioned above, Fig. 1) we consider that latter to be a better <lb/>estimate. To further test the coverage, high-density filters <lb/>were screened with probes corresponding to single copy <lb/>gene used as anchor markers in legume and that have <lb/>been placed on the Arachis AA genetic map (unpublished <lb/>data). An average of 5.1 clones per probe was identified in <lb/>the AA genome and 4.5 in the BB (Table 2). <lb/>The hybridization of both BAC libraries with an Arachis <lb/> resistance gene analogue RGA S1_A_36 identified two <lb/>clones in the AA genome but none in the BB genome <lb/>(Table 2). <lb/> Discussion <lb/> Cultivated peanut is an allotetraploid with two nuclear <lb/>genomic components, AA and BB.

			diploid wild ancestors, the exact species involved has been <lb/>a matter of some research and discussion. Although the <lb/>evidence is not completely clear cut, analysis of data from <lb/>molecular markers, cytogenetics, morphology and geo-<lb/>graphical distributions support that A. duranensis and A. <lb/>ipaënsis are the direct ancestors of cultivated peanut <lb/>[8,30]. <lb/>Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) of A. hypogaea met-<lb/>aphase chromosomes with total genomic DNA from the <lb/>AA genome of A. duranensis and the BB genome of A. <lb/>ipaënsis allowed a clear differentiation of the A and B chro-<lb/>mosomes. Firstly, this observation reinforces the evidence <lb/>of the close relationship between the genomes of A. duran-<lb/>ensis, A. ipaënsis and cultivated peanut. Secondly, since <lb/>GISH relies largely on the hybridization of repetitive <lb/>sequences, it also indicates that A. duranensis and A. ipaën-<lb/>sis genomes have diverged substantially regarding their <lb/>repeated sequences/transposable elements contents. <lb/>In contrast, the evidence available indicates that the gene <lb/>order in the AA and BB genomes is substantially conserved <lb/>[9]. This situation of largely syntenic gene frameworks <lb/>embedded within quickly evolving repetitive DNA seems <lb/>to be a recurrent theme in plant evolution [36-39]. <lb/>The availability of BAC libraries from the allopolyploid <lb/>and the two wild ancestors will allow the comparison of <lb/>these genomes regarding microsynteny and repetitive <lb/>DNA contents, in particular transposable elements and <lb/>will provide insights into the fascinating area of polyploid <lb/>genome evolution. <lb/> Table 2: BAC library filter-hybridization results using legume single-copy probes and one RGA <lb/> Probe <lb/>Number of BAC clones detected <lb/> A. duranensis <lb/>A. ipaënsis <lb/> RGA S1_A_36 <lb/>2 <lb/>0 <lb/>Leg083 <lb/>2 <lb/>5 <lb/>Leg128 <lb/>4 <lb/>4 <lb/>Leg092, Leg149, Leg178 (mixed) <lb/>19 <lb/>Leg 92 <lb/>10 <lb/>* <lb/>Leg237 <lb/>5 <lb/>* <lb/>Leg242 <lb/>6 <lb/>* <lb/>Leg 88 <lb/>0 <lb/>* <lb/>Average Leg clones <lb/>5,11 <lb/>4,5 <lb/>* Not tested <lb/> A. duranensis (a) and A. ipaënsis (b) libraries sizing <lb/> Figure 2 <lb/> A. duranensis (a) and A. ipaënsis (b) libraries sizing. <lb/> Random BAC clones from the A. duranensis (a) and A. ipaënsis <lb/> (b) libraries digested with NotI and separated by PGEF.

			In addition, the legume single copy anchor markers, used <lb/>to characterize the libraries, will allow orthologous <lb/>regions to be identified and compared between the AA <lb/>and BB Arachis genomes, and with other legume genomes, <lb/>in particular the sequenced genomes of Lotus and Medi-<lb/>cago, providing insight into legume genome evolution. <lb/>Construction of BAC libraries in some plants can require <lb/>substantial effort due to particular chemical constitution <lb/>as already experienced by us before [32]. For Arachis, <lb/> obtaining good quality HMW DNA was difficult due to <lb/>contamination from polyphenols and carbohydrates, <lb/>which are abundant in Arachis leaves. A number of steps <lb/>had to be added to the standard protocols of nuclei extrac-<lb/>tion and several ligations had to be made to obtain a rea-<lb/>sonable number of BAC clones. These difficulties were <lb/>also reported by Yuksel and Paterson [29] for the con-<lb/>struction of the A hypogaea BAC library. <lb/>The genome coverage of the BAC libraries was estimated <lb/>between 7.4 and 5.1 haploid genome equivalents for the <lb/>A genome and 5.3 to 4.5 for the B genome. These dispari-<lb/>ties are due to variations of the density of restriction sites <lb/>in certain genome regions or difficulties in cloning too <lb/>large or too small fragments [40]. Considering that 99% <lb/>coverage is equivalent to 4.7× haploid genomes [40]A. <lb/> duranensis and A ipaënsis genomes are well represented <lb/>and the libraries will be suitable for many applications. <lb/>The availability of BAC libraries from diploid Arachis will <lb/>greatly facilitate the development of a reference physical <lb/>map for Arachis. The construction of this physical map <lb/>will be initiated soon with the A. duranensis BAC library. <lb/>This species was used as a parent of the mapping popula-<lb/>tion used for the construction of the Arachis SSR-based <lb/>map [10]. A. ipaënsis is also the parent of a mapping pop-<lb/>ulation [11]. This will facilitate the integration of genetic <lb/>and physical maps. <lb/>The exploitation of peanut&apos;s diploid wild relatives for <lb/>breeding is very attractive since they possess various resist-<lb/>ances to biotic and abiotic stresses. The two species used <lb/>to make the BAC libraries harbour resistances to nema-<lb/>tode and fungal diseases[41,42]. These new BAC resources <lb/>will help the tagging and/or the isolation of the corre-<lb/>sponding resistance genes. For example, a QTL for resist-<lb/>ance to late leaf spot, caused by Cercosporidium personatum <lb/> has been mapped in a cross of A. duranensis with A. steno-<lb/>sperma [43]. S1_A_36, a RGA that co-segregates with this <lb/>QTL has been used to identify two BAC clones in the A. <lb/>duranensis library, whilst no clones in the A. ipaënsis <lb/> library were found. Sequencing of the BAC clones should <lb/>enable the identification of microsatellites in the target <lb/>region, thus providing more convenient markers for track-<lb/>ing the QTL in segregating populations. <lb/> Conclusion <lb/> In summary, here we describe the production of BAC <lb/>libraries for the AA and BB genomes of Arachis. The librar-<lb/>ies will be a useful resource for the isolation of genes, the <lb/>construction and correlation of physical and genetic <lb/>maps, the isolation of probes for cytogenetic analysis, the <lb/>study of the evolution of the two genome types, and, by <lb/>comparison with the allotetraploid genome of cultivated <lb/>peanut, for the study of the evolution of polyploid <lb/>genomes. <lb/> Methods <lb/> Plant Material <lb/> Seeds were obtained from the Arachis germplasm collec-<lb/>tion, maintained at Embrapa Genetic Resources and Bio-<lb/>technology – CENARGEN (Brasília-DF, Brazil). The <lb/>germination was improved by placing the seeds on a blot-<lb/>ting paper humidified with a 1% Ethephon. For HMW <lb/>DNA isolation, A. duranensis V14167 (genome AA) and A. <lb/>ipaënsis KG30076 (genome BB) were grown under green-<lb/>house conditions. Young leaves were collected in liquid <lb/>nitrogen then stored at -80°C. <lb/> Probe labelling and fluorescent in situ hybridization <lb/> Whole genomic DNA from A. duranensis and A. ipaënsis <lb/> were used as probes in genomic in situ hybridization <lb/>(GISH). Probes were labelled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP <lb/>(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) or biotin-11-dUTP <lb/>(Sigma) by nick translation. <lb/>Pre-treatment of preparations, chromosome and probe <lb/>denaturation, conditions for the in situ hybridization <lb/>(hybridization mixes contained DNA probes at a concen-<lb/>tration of 2.5–3.5 ng/μL), post-hybridization washings, <lb/>blocking, and indirect detection by fluorochrome conju-<lb/>gated antibodies were performed according to Moscone et <lb/>al[44]. Antibodies consisted of mouse anti-biotin (Dako-<lb/>patts, Dako, Carpinteria, California, USA) and sheep anti-<lb/>digoxigenin conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate <lb/>(FITC) (Roche) in PBS (0.13 mol/L NaCl, 0.007 mol/L <lb/>Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.003 mol/L NaH 2 PO 4 ), 3% (w/v) bovine <lb/>serum albumin (BSA) or, rabbit anti-mouse conjugated to <lb/>tetramethyl-rodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) (Dako-<lb/>patts) and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep (Dakopatts) <lb/>in PBS, 3% (w/v) BSA. Preparations were counterstained <lb/>and mounted with Vectashield medium (Vector Laborato-<lb/>ries, Burlingame, California, USA) containing 2 μg/mL of <lb/>4&apos;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). <lb/>The DAPI counterstaining subsequent to GISH resulted in <lb/>a C banding-like pattern with major heterochromatin <lb/>bands fluorescing more intensely, thus aiding chromo-<lb/>some identification [8,44]. <lb/>

			Fluorescence microscopy and image acquisition <lb/> Chromosomes were viewed and photographed with a <lb/>Leica DMLB fluorescence microscope (Leica, Heerbrugg, <lb/>Switzerland) equipped with a computer-assisted Leica DC <lb/>250 digital camera system. Red, green, and blue images <lb/>were captured in black and white using appropriate filters <lb/>for TRITC, FITC, and DAPI excitation, respectively. Digital <lb/>images were pseudo-coloured and combined using IM <lb/>1000 Leica software, then imported into Adobe Pho-<lb/>toshop, version 7.0 (Adobe, San Jose, California, USA) for <lb/>final processing. <lb/> HMW DNA isolation <lb/> Nuclei were isolated from leaves according to Meyers et al. <lb/>[31] with some modifications. Fifty grams of young leaves <lb/>were ground in liquid nitrogen and nuclei were liberated <lb/>by incubating the cell extract at 4°C for 20 min in HB 1× <lb/>extraction buffer, plus 0.2% of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP <lb/>40). PVP was added to the buffer to reduce the production <lb/>of oxidizing polyphenolic substances. To eliminate cell <lb/>debris, the leaf homogenate was filtered successively <lb/>through four layers of cheesecloth then two layers of Mir-<lb/>acloth (250 μm), (Calbiochem, UK) and a low speed cen-<lb/>trifugation (60 × g for 2 min) was performed. <lb/>Centrifugation at 850 × g for 8 min at 4°C was followed <lb/>by a Percoll gradient (37.5%) to separate nuclei from the <lb/>pectin matrix [45]. The nuclei was washed in 20 mL of HB <lb/>1× extraction buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and Tri-<lb/>ton-100×, and then centrifuged at 850 × g for 8 min at <lb/>4°C. Finally the nuclei pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of <lb/>filtered HB 1× and embedded in 1.2% low-melting-point <lb/>agarose plugs (InCert Agarose, Cambrex-Bioscience, Rock-<lb/>land, Inc.). An aliquot of the nuclei extraction was evalu-<lb/>ated under a microscope using DAPI staining to observe <lb/>the integrity of the nuclei and the purity of the preparation <lb/>in terms of organelle contamination. Agarose plugs con-<lb/>taining HMW DNA were incubated for 24 h at 50°C in <lb/>lysis buffer (5% Sodium Lauryl Sarcosyl, 0.625 M EDTA <lb/>pH 9.0, 50 mg Proteinase K), washed for 1 h at 4°C in <lb/>inactivation solution (0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM PMSF), <lb/>then washed four times for 30 min in TE 10/10 (10 mM <lb/>Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). An extra HMW DNA <lb/>purification step was conducted with a pulsed-field gel <lb/>electrophoresis (PFGE) using a CHEF Mapper™ XA appa-<lb/>ratus (Bio-Rad, U.K.) at 6 V/cm, with 3 s of switch time, <lb/>and an angle of 120° for 40 min aiming to eliminate the <lb/>degraded DNA. Agarose plugs were finally washed four <lb/>times for 30 min in TE 10/1 (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM <lb/>EDTA, pH 8.0). at 4°C before being used for restriction <lb/>enzyme digestions. <lb/> BAC library construction <lb/> Agarose plugs containing HMW DNA were chopped into <lb/>small pieces and incubated on ice, with agitation, three <lb/>times in 1 mL of HindIII restriction buffer (Gibco BRL, <lb/>USA), with buffer exchange every 30 min. Seven units of <lb/> HindIII was added to each chopped plug and allowed to <lb/>diffuse for 4 hours on ice. For partial digestions, the reac-<lb/>tions were incubated for 15 min at 37°C and then <lb/>stopped by adding one-tenth of the total volume of 0.5 M <lb/>EDTA, pH 8.0. Partially digested HMW DNA was size-<lb/>selected by two successive PFGE in 1% GTG SEAKEM aga-<lb/>rose gels in 0.5× TBE at 14°C. The first-sizing was per-<lb/>formed at 6 V/cm, with 1 s to 50 s of switch-time, and an <lb/>angle of 120° for 20 h. Two regions from 80 to150 kb and <lb/>150 to 250 kb were excised from the gel and loaded onto <lb/>a new gel. The second-sizing selection was then performed <lb/>at 6 V/cm, with 3 s of switch time, and an angle of 120° <lb/>for 20 h. The regions from 100 to 250 kb were cut out <lb/>from the latter gel and the DNA was recovered through an <lb/>electro-elution (BIO-RAD/electro-eluter, UK). DNA con-<lb/>centration was estimated in 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE. Sev-<lb/>eral ligation reactions were tested containing different <lb/>ratios of vector to insert. A constant 30 ng of the commer-<lb/>cial vector &quot;pIndigo BAC-5 HindIII-Cloning Ready&quot; (Epi-<lb/>centre, USA) was used, and varying amounts of DNA <lb/>ranging from 50 to 600 ng of HMW DNA were used. One <lb/>microlitre of ligation was mixed to 20 microlitres of com-<lb/>petent E. coli cells (ElectroMAX DH10B, Invitrogen) and <lb/>electro-transformed using a BRL Cell-Porator system <lb/>according to the manufacturer&apos;s recommendations but <lb/>with a charge rate of 355 volts. Transformants were <lb/>selected on 2YT plates (tryptone 16 g/L, yeast extract 10 g/ <lb/>L, sodium chloride 5 g/L, agar 16 g/L) containing 12.5 μg/ <lb/> mL of chloramphenicol, 50 μg/mL of 5-bromo-4-chloro-<lb/>3-indole-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) and 25 μg/mL of <lb/>isopropyl-thiogalactoside (IPTG). White colonies were <lb/>picked using a Q-Pix 2 colony picker robot (Genetix) and <lb/>transferred to 384-well plates containing 80 μL of 2YT, 7% <lb/>glycerol. Microplates were incubated for 18–20 h at 37°C <lb/>and stored at -80°C. <lb/> BAC library screening and DNA isolation <lb/> For estimation of BAC clone insert sizes, random individ-<lb/>ual clones were grown in 100 μL pre-innoculum and then <lb/>in 3 mL 2YT liquid medium containing chloramphenicol <lb/>(12.5 μg/mL). BAC DNA was isolated using a QIAGEN <lb/>BIO-ROBOT 9600 (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). BAC DNA <lb/>was digested with NotI to release the inserts. The digested <lb/>clones were separated by PFGE at 6 V, a switch time from <lb/>5 to 15 s, an angle of 120° and run for 15 h. High-density <lb/>filters were made using a Q-Pix 2 robot (Genetix). Each <lb/>high-density filter contained 18,432 double-spotted <lb/>clones. Hybridisations were performed as described in the <lb/>Clemson BAC protocols [45]. Filters were exposed for 24 <lb/>h to Ferrania LifeRay XCG-films. <lb/> Genomic probes <lb/> Estimation of organelle contamination in both libraries <lb/>was evaluated by hybridization of high-density filters <lb/>
