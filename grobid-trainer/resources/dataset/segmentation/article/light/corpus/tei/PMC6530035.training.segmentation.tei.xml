			<body>Establishing a venoarterial extracorporeal membrane <lb/>oxygenation (vaECMO) in cardiac arrest is known as <lb/>extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR). <lb/>After eCPR, patients commonly present with a com-<lb/>bined respiratory and metabolic acidosis [1]. It is clear <lb/>that acidosis negatively impacts survival after eCPR [2] <lb/>and that a respiratory acidosis can be easily corrected <lb/>by vaECMO. Current guidelines for conventional CPR <lb/>suggest normocapnia as targeted after return of spon-<lb/>taneous circulation [3]. This recommendation is based <lb/>on heterogeneous data. While a recent meta-analysis <lb/>found adverse outcome in both hyper-and hypocapnia <lb/>[4], a randomized trial reported no difference in sur-<lb/>vival in low normal and high normal paCO 2 [5]. <lb/>The aim of the present study was to correlate arter-<lb/>ial paCO 2 and pH with hospital survival in eCPR. <lb/>A single-center retrospective register analysis was <lb/>performed. All eCPR patients treated between 2010 <lb/>and 2017 were included. We analyzed arterial blood <lb/>gases after 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h as well as hos-<lb/>pital mortality. We detected a total of 186 eCPR. The <lb/>mean age was 58.6 ± 14.9 years, and total hospital sur-<lb/>vival rate was 26.3%. After cannulation, paCO 2 and pH <lb/>values were (mean ± standard deviation) 38.3 ± 8.9 <lb/>mmHg/7.28 ± 0.14 (+ 1 h), 38.5 ± 8.5 mmHg/7.30 ± 0.11 <lb/>(+ 3 h), 38.72 ± 7.42 mmHg/7.31 ± 0.11 (+ 6 h), 38.62 ± <lb/>7.26 mmHg/7.34 ± 0.10 (+ 12 h), and 38.22 ± 5.62 mmHg/ <lb/>7.38 ± 0.09 (+ 24 h), respectively. When comparing <lb/>patients with paCO 2 &lt; 35, 35-45, and &gt; 45 mmHg, sur-<lb/>vival was statistically similar for all observed time points. <lb/>There was however a highly significant association be-<lb/>tween hospital survival and pH when comparing groups <lb/>with pH &lt; 7.3, 7.3-7.4, and &gt; 7.4 (see Fig. 1). <lb/>As secondary endpoint and surrogate for neuro-<lb/>logical outcome, neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was <lb/>analyzed. Maximum NSE measured within 72 h after <lb/>eCPR was 150.8 ± 145.1 μg/l (mean ± standard devi-<lb/>ation). When correlating maximum NSE with paCO <lb/>at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after eCPR, no statistical signifi-<lb/>cant linear correlation was found (p &gt; 0.4 for all time <lb/>points). There was however a significant linear correl-<lb/>ation of maximum NSE and pH at 1, 3, and 6 h after <lb/>eCPR (p = 0.037, 0.029, and 0.018, respectively). <lb/>In this registry study, we found a strong correlation <lb/>between hospital survival and arterial pH but no such <lb/></body>

			<body>correlation with paCO 2 . Also elevated NSE as a marker <lb/>for neural injury did correlate with pH but not with <lb/>paCO 2 . Being a retrospective, observational, single-cen-<lb/>ter study, inherent limitations and biases are to be pre-<lb/>sumed and findings are to be considered hypothesis <lb/>generating. Until further data are available however, it <lb/>might be reasonable to correct both respiratory and <lb/>metabolic acidosis in eCPR patients. <lb/></body>
