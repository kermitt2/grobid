			<body>Introduction <lb/>embers of diphyllobothridae are <lb/>the most significant cestoda that <lb/>infect fish as the intermediated <lb/>host in the plerocercoid phase (1). This family <lb/>has significant genera like Ligula intestinalis, and <lb/>Digramma interrupta is distributed all around the <lb/>world. <lb/>The position of D. interrupta in <lb/>diphyllobothridae family remains disputable <lb/>since it was raised by Cholodkovsky from L. <lb/>alternans. Morphological differences, with one <lb/>set of reproductive organs in L. intestinalis and <lb/>two sets of this in D. interrupta, present the <lb/>most important differences between them. <lb/>However, the morphological features are not <lb/>completely reliable to distinguish genus from <lb/>each other (2). <lb/>One of the aims of this study was support or <lb/>reject the validity of D. interrupta and its corre-<lb/>lation with L. intestinalis on the basis of mor-<lb/>phological characteristics and a study of mo-<lb/>lecular data based on entire internal tran-<lb/>scribed spacer of the ribosomal DNA (ITS <lb/>rDNA) that contains ITS1-5.8S and ITS2. In <lb/>addition, this study intends to assess the ge-<lb/>netic diversity of L. intestinalis or D. interrupta <lb/>from different hosts and geographical regions. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Samples collection <lb/>Overall, 1301 fish varieties, including 883 <lb/>Alburnoides bipunctatus (A. bipunctatus) and 418 <lb/>Abramis brama (A. brama), were collected from <lb/>north and north-western parts of Iran. A. <lb/>bipunctatus samples were obtained from fresh <lb/>water sources of the Maragheh dam (north-<lb/>west) and the Ramesar Lake (north). Moreo-<lb/>ver, samples of A. brama were captured from <lb/>the Aras Dam (northwest) and the Bandar-e-<lb/>Anzali lagoon (north) (Fig. 1). The samples <lb/>were put into ice boxes and immediately trans-<lb/>ferred to the laboratory; they were isolated <lb/>from body cavities of infectious fish and pre-<lb/>served either by being placed in 96% ethanol <lb/>or being stored at -20 °C for morphological <lb/>and molecular analysis. <lb/>Morphological characterizations <lb/>The samples&apos; terminal segments were <lb/>stained with aceto-carmine and mounted with <lb/>the Canada balsam. The specimens were iden-<lb/>tified as L. intestinalis and D. interrupta by using <lb/>characters that are suitable for species identifi-<lb/>cation according to taxonomic keys (3). <lb/>Fig. 1: Localities in Iran where specimens of Ligula intestinalis and Digramma interrupta were collected <lb/>The morphological characterization of <lb/>plerocercoid was completed by observing <lb/>them under a light microscope equipped with <lb/>the camera lucida.

These primers were designed <lb/>by Vector NTI11. The first for the 891bp <lb/>fragment comprised ITS1-5.8S, and second <lb/>for the 421bp sequence-long inclusive ITS2 <lb/>locus (Table 1). The PCR product was puri-<lb/>fied by using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen, <lb/>Germany). The sequencing was performed <lb/>from both sites of each PCR products by <lb/>Kawsar Biotech Company in Iran on the basis <lb/>of the Sanger method (1977).

From 883 spec-<lb/>imens of A. bipunctatus and 418 collected sam-<lb/>ples of A. brama, 558 (63.19%) and 67 fishes <lb/>(16%) were infected, respectively (Table 2). <lb/>After blast, the data, according to the ITS <lb/>locus, 13 isolates were determined from D. <lb/>interrupta and 10 samples were determined L. <lb/>intestinalis.

			<body>Climatic conditions in the north-western <lb/>part of the country are more conducive to <lb/>these parasites, while another probable reason <lb/>could be the neighborhood of Turkey. Since <lb/>Turkey is a good source of pollution by Ligu-<lb/>lidae plerocercoid, maybe water imported <lb/>from Turkey can be attributed to infection of <lb/>water by plerocercoid in northwest Iran (8). <lb/>Another reason could be migratory birds that <lb/>could transmit the infection in nearby loca-<lb/>tions in two adjacent countries. <lb/>Host specificity probably exists in Iran be-<lb/>cause D. interrupta was detected only from A. <lb/>brama, in Russia (9). In addition, similar to a <lb/>survey (5), results from northwest Iran <lb/>showed detection of plerocercoid of L. <lb/>intestinalis from A. bipunctatus. However, the <lb/>morphological difference could be used to <lb/>detect the genus and species from each other, <lb/>but it is not enough and an accurate meter is <lb/>needed for distinguishing the species and line-<lb/>age from each other. Therefore, over the last <lb/>two decades, molecular studies have helped <lb/>scientists to improve and revise their infor-<lb/>mation about the taxonomical status of para-<lb/>sites and their phylogeny. <lb/>Despite various studies on the epidemiologi-<lb/>cal aspect of this Cestoda, any molecular char-<lb/>acterization is not found in Iran and also in <lb/>the entire Middle East zone. Thus, there is <lb/>lack of sufficient information about the mo-<lb/>lecular characteristics of this Pseudophyllidean <lb/>Cestoda in this zone. It confirms the necessity <lb/>of a study on molecular and morphological <lb/>features of this genus, and another genus of <lb/>this family, as well as their true taxonomical <lb/>station in this region. <lb/>Liao and Liang (10) watched in Digramma the <lb/>transitional reproductive organ structure. A <lb/>single set of reproductive organs was located <lb/>at the anterior end of the larva in the carassian <lb/>intermediate hosts and also two rows of this <lb/>were located at the posterior end. Sexual di-<lb/>morphism was reported in D. interrupta in A. <lb/>brama the reproductive organs found in <lb/>one row, whereas two rows occur in those <lb/>from carp (9). Maybe D. interrupta was just a <lb/>rare diplogonadic form of the Ligula species <lb/>(2). In L. intestinalis dimorphism with some of <lb/>them debating on the potential existence of <lb/>this species in the Ligula genus. For example, <lb/>based on ITS region and 28S rRNA, verified <lb/>that plerocercoid of L. intestinalis specimens <lb/>from Rutilus and Gobio may represent different <lb/>strains or species (11). Despite recognition of <lb/>species based on morphological features ap-<lb/>propriate for the discrimination between two <lb/>genera (3), the morphological specification of <lb/>them is not reliable and raises much confusion <lb/>concerning D. interrupta validity because of the <lb/>transitional shape of reproductive organs in <lb/>the proglottids of these two genera. <lb/>In the present study, D. interrupta exhibited <lb/>identical sequences with L. intestinalis with <lb/>about 1% heterology based on the ITS1-5.8S <lb/>regions analysis, whereas a high degree of ge-<lb/>netic diversity of about 3% to 7% has seen <lb/>based on the ITS2 locus. The present study <lb/>also suggests that ITS2, unlike ITS1-5.8S se-<lb/>quences, can act as a useful genetic marker. <lb/>There is not any yardstick for identifying <lb/>species or genus borders by using the result of <lb/>the DNA-sequence distinction, with a value of <lb/>divergence based on ITS2 sequences, D. <lb/>interrupta is almost different from L. intestinalis. <lb/>Therefore, with nucleotide variation levels be-<lb/>tween L. intestinalis and D. interrupta specimens, <lb/>besides morphological differences, it cannot <lb/>be verified whether D. interrupta is a synonym <lb/>of the genus L. intestinalis, against the theory of <lb/>some researchers (10, 11). <lb/>On the other hand, they are different genera <lb/>because of low levels of nucleotide variation <lb/>and unstable morphological difference be-<lb/>tween them. Maybe polymorphism seen in L. <lb/>intestinalis and D. interrupta is present only in <lb/>some global locations (10, 12). Besides low <lb/>levels of nucleotide variation (else two sam-<lb/>ples that have 6% and 7% diversity, the other <lb/>differences would amount to (3% to 4%), we <lb/>reach and verify the theory that maybe D. <lb/>interrupta was just a rare diplogonadic form of <lb/>the Ligula species (2) not a different genus and <lb/>not synonymous with the Ligula genus, but <lb/></body>

			<body>only another species of the Ligula genus. Phy-<lb/>logenetic tree results have displayed differ-<lb/>ences between clade A and clade B, verifying <lb/>that the effect of geography in speciation and <lb/>its effect on molecular structures. L. intestinalis <lb/>and D. interrupta samples were different from <lb/>samples registered in GenBank. Eleven sam-<lb/>ples of D. interrupta and eight samples of L. <lb/>intestinalis were located in a common cluster so <lb/>that it may be support the analogy of this ge-<lb/>nus. Moreover, the discrepancy amount of 1% <lb/>to 4%, shown in the sequence of L. intestinalis <lb/>samples, were compared with each other in <lb/>the same host that could supplement the pres-<lb/>ence of a species and/or strains in this genus <lb/>much like results derived by other researchers <lb/>(12,13). <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>ITS2 may be one of the most useful markers <lb/>used to distinguish L. intestinalis from D. <lb/>interrupta. It can also be used to detect the var-<lb/>iations within L. intestinalis. Further, D. <lb/>interrupta may be another species of the Ligula <lb/>genus. On the other hand, they could not be <lb/>different genera because of low levels of nu-<lb/>cleotide variation arising from the possibility <lb/>of polymorphism and therefore D. interrupta is <lb/>another species of the Ligula genus. Its possi-<lb/>ble presence as a species and/or strains in the <lb/>Ligula genus is based on host specificity. <lb/></body>
