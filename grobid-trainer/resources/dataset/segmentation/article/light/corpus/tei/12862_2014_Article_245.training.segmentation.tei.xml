			<front> R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E <lb/>Open Access <lb/> Hybridisation and diversification in the adaptive <lb/>radiation of clownfishes <lb/> Glenn Litsios 1,2 and Nicolas Salamin 1,2* <lb/> Abstract <lb/> Background: The importance of hybridisation during species diversification has long been debated among <lb/>evolutionary biologists. It is increasingly recognised that hybridisation events occurred during the evolutionary <lb/>history of numerous species, especially during the early stages of adaptive radiation. We study the effect of <lb/>hybridisation on diversification in the clownfishes, a clade of coral reef fish that diversified through an adaptive <lb/>radiation process. While two species of clownfish are likely to have been described from hybrid specimens, the <lb/>occurrence and effect of hybridisation on the clade diversification is yet unknown. <lb/> Results: We generate sequences of three mitochondrial genes to complete an existing dataset of nuclear <lb/>sequences and document cytonuclear discordance at a node, which shows a drastic increase of diversification rate. <lb/>Then, using a tree-based jack-knife method, we identify clownfish species likely stemming from hybridisation events. <lb/>Finally, we use molecular cloning and identify the putative parental species of four clownfish specimens that display <lb/>the morphological characteristics of hybrids. <lb/> Conclusions: Our results show that consistently with the syngameon hypothesis, hybridisation events are linked <lb/>with a burst of diversification in the clownfishes. Moreover, several recently diverged clownfish lineages likely <lb/>originated through hybridisation, which indicates that diversification, catalysed by hybridisation events, may still be <lb/>happening. <lb/> Keywords: Syngameon, Speciation, Diversification, Cytonuclear discordance, Anemonefish <lb/></front> 
			
			<body>Background <lb/> Hybridisation has long been considered as a process redu-<lb/>cing genetic diversity through introgression [1]. Thus, the <lb/>effect of hybridisation on species diversification should, if <lb/>anything, be negative due to the potential reduction in fit-<lb/>ness of the hybrids. However views are changing as many <lb/>evolutionary radiations have now documented cases in <lb/>which hybridisation plays a key role in promoting species <lb/>diversification. Common examples of hybridisation indu-<lb/>cing diversification can be found in the Galapagos finches <lb/>[2], Hawaiian Lapaula crickets [3] and Rift Lakes cichlids <lb/>[4,5]. Building on those evidences and others, Seehausen <lb/>proposed that hybridisation may promote speciation <lb/>and adaptive radiation by generating new genetic and <lb/>phenotypic variation that can be the target of selection <lb/>[6]. With more and more cases of hybrid speciation be-<lb/>ing documented [7], the main question is now shifting <lb/>towards understanding how evolutionary radiations are <lb/>facilitated or even catalysed, rather than prevented, by <lb/>hybridisation [8]. <lb/>During adaptive radiation, available ecological niches <lb/>are filled by the diversifying species [9]. In the classical <lb/>view, this process occurs through specific phenotypic adap-<lb/>tations that allow the constituent species to take advantage <lb/>of the diversity of ecological niches [10]. Hybridisation be-<lb/>tween incipient species has been proposed as a mechanism <lb/>that is able to rapidly create new phenotypic combinations <lb/>suitable for further occupancy of untapped niches [6]. In-<lb/>deed, transgressive segregation can produce individuals <lb/>with novel phenotypes reaching beyond the possibilities of <lb/>the parental populations [11,12]. For example, the comple-<lb/>mentary action of genes regulating mineral ion uptake <lb/>allowed hybrids of species of Helianthus sunflowers to sur-<lb/>vive in salt marshes while none of the parent species are <lb/>salt tolerant [13]. Such an event can create new species <lb/></body>

			<body> very rapidly, especially when the newly formed hybrids are <lb/>ecologically distinct from the two parent species [14]. For <lb/>instance, as little as 10 to 60 generations are needed for re-<lb/>combination to no longer reduce the size of parental link-<lb/>age blocks in Helianthus, which is a clear sign of genome <lb/>stabilisation in the hybrids [15]. This mechanism is never-<lb/>theless dependent on the availability of untapped ecological <lb/>niches. Indeed, the frequency of hybridisation events lead-<lb/>ing to speciation will decrease after the initial burst of <lb/>adaptive radiation because of the saturation of the niche <lb/>space [6]. While the theoretical grounds defining the po-<lb/>tential role of hybridisation as an important component of <lb/>species diversification have been laid, empirical evidence is <lb/>needed to better illustrate the effects of this factor during <lb/>adaptive radiations. <lb/>Several methods exist to identify putative hybridisation <lb/>events in evolutionary radiations (reviewed in [6]). Discord-<lb/>ance between phylogenetic trees inferred with either cyto-<lb/>plasmic (chloroplast or mitochondrial) or nuclear DNA can <lb/>suggest the occurrence of hybridisation. This is possible be-<lb/>cause phylogenetic trees based on cytoplasmic information <lb/>will show the evolutionary history of females while nuclear <lb/>DNA will illustrate that of the parental allele that has been <lb/>fixed. Moreover, a tree-based method (the homoplasy ex-<lb/>cess test; HET) has been proposed to identify putative hy-<lb/>brid taxa and likely parental lineages [6]. While DNA <lb/>sequences of cytoplasmic or nuclear origin are now readily <lb/>available for a growing number of species, these approaches <lb/>have only been used scarcely (e.g. [16]). Given the potential <lb/>importance of hybridisation for species diversification, there <lb/>is a need to study new cases such as comprehending more <lb/>fully the interactions between hybridisation and speciation. <lb/>In this context, we study hybridisation patterns in the <lb/>clownfishes (or anemonefishes; Pomacentridae), a mono-<lb/>phyletic clade which maintains mutualistic interactions with <lb/>sea anemones [17]. This behaviour is the key innovation <lb/>that promoted the adaptive radiation of clownfishes as spe-<lb/>cies segregated among specific combinations of potential <lb/>host species and habitat, each time matching their pheno-<lb/>type to the environment [18]. While this process of eco-<lb/>logical speciation [9] could alone be responsible for the <lb/>extant diversity of clownfish species, evidence suggests that <lb/>hybridisation may have occurred during the evolution of <lb/>the group. Indeed, a recent phylogenetic tree of the clade <lb/>based on nuclear markers showed several discordant nodes <lb/>with previous phylogenetic trees reconstructed mostly from <lb/>mitochondrial markers [19]. Moreover, interspecific pairs <lb/>have been observed in the wild and two species, Amphi-<lb/>prion leucokranos and A. thiellei, were likely described from <lb/>hybrid material [17,20]. This indicates a potential history of <lb/>hybridisation in the group. However, whether it impacted <lb/>on the diversification of clownfishes is yet unknown. <lb/>To resolve this issue, we analyse a dataset of mitochon-<lb/>drial and nuclear DNA sequences of clownfish species to <lb/>assess cyto-nuclear discordances and highlight possible <lb/>ancient hybridisation events. Furthermore, we use the <lb/>HET approach to identify species of hybrid origin. Finally, <lb/>we investigate potential hybrids among clownfish individ-<lb/>uals showing hybrid phenotypic characteristics and use <lb/>molecular cloning to assess their status and putatively <lb/>identify the parental species. <lb/> Results <lb/> We define from phylogenetic inference eight monophy-<lb/>letic groups of species to facilitate the interpretation of <lb/>our results (Table 1). The clade names are based on clas-<lb/>sical clownfish taxonomy that describes 6 species com-<lb/>plexes [21]. <lb/> Discordance between phylogenetic hypotheses <lb/> The two consensus phylogenetic trees that we obtain <lb/>show an overall good support with only several recent <lb/>splits showing low posterior probabilities (Figure 1). <lb/>Major clades appear in both mitochondrial and nuclear <lb/>phylogenetic trees. Despite the fact that the two datasets <lb/>show well resolved topologies, the relative position of <lb/>the main clades is different between the two analyses <lb/>(Figure 1, see Additional files 1 and 2 for a complete il-<lb/>lustration of node support). The organisation of the per-<lb/>cula clade at the base of the clownfish tree and the <lb/>position of A. latezonatus is congruent between the two <lb/>datasets. However, the Australian group and A. chrysop-<lb/>terus intercalate between the polymnus and Indian <lb/>groups in the nuclear dataset. We identify two mito-<lb/>chondrial lineages in A. sandaracinos with a posterior <lb/>probability of 1, but both samples are clustered in the <lb/>nuclear phylogenetic tree.

			phylogenetic tree, becomes sister to the Australian clade <lb/>with the mitochondrial dataset. This suggest the exis-<lb/>tence of a hybridisation event at the time of node 8 <lb/>(Figure 2). Other studies showed that a main upward shift <lb/>in speciation rate occurred at this specific node [22,23]. <lb/> Hybrid signal <lb/> We recover an excess of homoplasy at nine nodes of the <lb/>clownfish phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). Removing either <lb/> A. ocellaris from Bali or A. percula from Papua New <lb/>Guinea increases the BS of Node 41 (Figure 2), which sug-<lb/>gests genetic exchange between members of the percula <lb/> clade. We find that the  &quot; black &quot;  specimen of A. clarkii col-<lb/>lected in Bali likely originated from hybridisation between <lb/>other members of the clarkii group (node 37, Figure 2). <lb/>We measure further increase of BS at three different <lb/>nodes (6, 16 and 17, Figure 2) when individuals of A. chry-<lb/>sopterus from either Moorea or the Solomon Islands are <lb/>removed. Moreover, the BS of node 17 increases when A. <lb/>akindynos is removed, which suggests several hybridisa-<lb/>tion events between A. chrysopterus and species of the <lb/>Australian and polymnus groups occurring around the <lb/>timeframe of node 16 and 17. We also find evidence of <lb/>genetic exchanges between members of the Indian group <lb/>at nodes 20, 22 and 23 (Figure 2). Finally, we identify gene <lb/>exchange between the two A. sandaracinos individuals at <lb/>node 13 and A. pacificus, but the effect on bootstrap <lb/>values is relatively small. <lb/> Identification of recent hybrid parental species <lb/> We infer the phylogenetic trees of mitochondrial (Figure 3) <lb/>and nuclear (Figure 4) markers for all sampled clownfish <lb/>species augmented with the additional sequences of the <lb/>supposed hybrid individuals. The cloning procedure <lb/>allowed us to separate the two parental BMP4 sequences <lb/>of each hybrid individual analysed (clones 1 and 2 in <lb/>Figure 4). As expected, we find that the BMP4 sequences <lb/>from those hybrid individuals that were cloned do not <lb/>cluster by individual species but are separated among par-<lb/>ental clades (Figure 4). We deduced the maternal origin of <lb/>the putative hybrids with the mitochondrial phylogenetic <lb/>tree. We find that both hybrids 2 and 3 inherited their <lb/>mitochondrial genes from A. akallopisos. The plastid se-<lb/>quence of hybrid 1 is similar to A. perideraion and A. leu-<lb/>cokranos, as already proposed [20], derives from A. <lb/>chrysopterus. Moreover, in the mitochondrial tree, A. leu-<lb/>cokranos clusters with A. chrysopterus sampled from the <lb/>Solomon Islands, the origin of A. leucokranos (Figure 5). <lb/>The maternal origin of the four hybrid individuals is highly <lb/>supported in the phylogenetic tree with posterior probabil-<lb/>ities of 1 on the respective ancestral nodes (Figure 3). The <lb/>nuclear tree confirms those results and each individual <lb/>has one of the cloned sequence that clusters with the same <lb/>species as in the mitochondrial tree (Figure 4). The pos-<lb/>ition of the other clone provides information on the pater-<lb/>nal origin of the hybrids. A. leucokranos clusters with high <lb/>posterior probability with A. sandaracinos and hybrid 1 <lb/> Figure 1 Cytonuclear incongruence.

			and 3 both cluster with A. perideraion. The other hybrid <lb/>individual (hybrid 3) clusters with any of A. pacificus, <lb/>A. sandaracinos and A. akallopisos, but low posterior <lb/>probabilities forbid any definitive conclusion. Neverthe-<lb/>less, we do not find clear evidence of recombination <lb/>events amongst the cloned sequences, suggesting that <lb/>we sequenced individuals deriving from recent hybri-<lb/>disation events. <lb/> Discussion <lb/> Our results show instances of cyto-nuclear incongruence <lb/>in the clownfish phylogenetic tree, which suggests several <lb/>hybridisation events. The most ancient of those events oc-<lb/>curred in the same time frame as a node that was identi-<lb/>fied twice independently as the highest increase in <lb/>diversification rate happening in the damselfish family <lb/>[22,23]. This evidence suggests a relationship between this <lb/>ancient hybridisation event and the main burst of diversifi-<lb/>cation of the adaptive radiation of clownfishes. Moreover, <lb/>we identify nodes with an excess of homoplasy that can be <lb/>attributed to more recent hybridisation events. Finally, we <lb/>identify the parental lineages of four hybrid individuals, <lb/>showing that hybridisation still occurs within clownfishes. <lb/>This evidence suggests that the diversification of the <lb/>clownfishes has been likely fuelled by hybridisation events <lb/>that created novel phenotypes and eventually new species <lb/>in a manner similar to the well-known East African <lb/>cichlids. <lb/> (a) <lb/> (b) <lb/> Figure 3 Mitochondrial phylogeny of hybrid individuals.

			Past hybridisation <lb/> We reconstruct separately the phylogenetic trees of the <lb/>mitochondrial (three markers) and nuclear (seven markers) <lb/>genomes. Most nodes show high posterior probabilities, <lb/>yet, several shallow nodes of our mitochondrial and nuclear <lb/>trees are only weakly supported. This can originate from <lb/>the lack of phylogenetic informative sites between closely <lb/>related species. Previous studies of phylogenetic relation-<lb/>ships of the Pomacentridae inferred by mitochondrial or <lb/>nuclear markers, all support the monophyly of the clown-<lb/>fish as well as the existence of the main clownfish clades <lb/>[18,23-25]. The topology obtained with the mitochondrial <lb/>data corresponds to these published phylogenetic trees. <lb/>We find several deep cytonuclear discordances in the <lb/>clownfish. The relative position of the ephippium clade <lb/>changes radically between the two datasets, which sug-<lb/>gests the occurrence of hybridisation in the timeframe of <lb/>node 8 (Figure 2).

			clownfishes, it is ancestral to 24 of the 28 species (30 de-<lb/>scribed species minus A. leucokranos and A. thiellei <lb/> which were likely described from hybrid material [20]). <lb/>This clade represents a major shift in diversification rate <lb/>with a 2.5-fold increase compared to the diversification <lb/>rate of Pomacentridae [22,23]. The pattern of concurrent <lb/>increase in rate of diversification and occurrence of hy-<lb/>bridisation fits into the framework of the syngameon hy-<lb/>pothesis [6], where hybridisation events preludes an <lb/>acceleration of ecological differentiation and diversification <lb/>rate. Moreover, this result is robust regarding node support, <lb/>as the relationship between the clarkii and the ephippium <lb/> clade is itself highly supported (see Additional file 1). <lb/>We find paraphyletic mitochondrial genotypes in A. <lb/>sandaracinos. The fact that the two A. sandaracinos in-<lb/>dividuals cluster with high support in the nuclear dataset <lb/>suggests a recent hybridisation event implying a mito-<lb/>chondrial genotype that belongs to an unknown lineage <lb/>of the akallopisos clade. Results of the HET suggest the <lb/>ongoing occurrence of genetic exchanges between A. <lb/>sandaracinos and A. pacificus (node 13, Figure 2). The <lb/>two species are phenotypically very similar and it is pos-<lb/>sible that a third cryptic species having the mitochon-<lb/>drial profile of the A. sandaracinos sample from Papua <lb/>New Guinea exists. The remaining topological inconsist-<lb/>encies of the polymnus clade are not well supported as <lb/>shown by the Bayesian posterior probabilities of their re-<lb/>spective nodes on the mitochondrial phylogeny. This <lb/>discrepancy may be artifactual and is thus not further <lb/>discussed. <lb/> Hybridisation and adaptive radiation <lb/> Our results highlight the existence of a main hybridisa-<lb/>tion event at the base of the Amphiprion crown group <lb/>(node 8, Figure 2). This node has been previously linked <lb/>with a burst of diversification rate in the clownfish clade <lb/>[22,23] and may also be mainly responsible for the in-<lb/>crease in rate of morphological evolution found in the <lb/>group [18]. In contrary, we did not detect traces of an-<lb/>cient hybridisation in the percula group which is species <lb/>poor relative to the Amphiprion crown group. One re-<lb/>cent hybridisation event likely occurred around node 41 <lb/>(Figure 2) between A. percula and A. ocellaris. The dis-<lb/>tribution of those two species is mostly allopatric, but <lb/>they share a common boundary and may overlap at <lb/>some locations [26] possibly leading to gene exchange. <lb/>Yet, despite similar behaviour and ecology, the species of <lb/>the percula clade seemingly failed to radiate [19]. The <lb/>fact that the clade deriving from a major hybridisation <lb/>event is the only one to show patterns of rapid speci-<lb/>ation supports the view that hybridisation can promote <lb/>diversification during adaptive radiation. Actually, hy-<lb/>bridisation appears to be one of the key factors explain-<lb/>ing the adaptive radiation of the clownfishes. <lb/> Recent hybridisation events <lb/> We identify the parental species of four putative hybrids, <lb/>one being A. leucokranos, which is currently described <lb/>as a species. Since their taxonomic descriptions, the spe-<lb/>cies status of A. leucokranos and A. thiellei has been <lb/>questioned [20]. Indeed, heterospecific pairs have been <lb/>observed in the wild and fish with similar phenotype can be <lb/>produced in aquaria by hybrid crosses [17]. Nevertheless, <lb/>evidence of A. leucokranos pairs also exist [27], tentatively <lb/>proposing that we may be witnessing hybrid speciation in <lb/>progress. Yet, demonstrating this ongoing process would <lb/>require more data than available here. It is thus more parsi-<lb/>monious to conclude at the moment, that A. leucokranos is <lb/>an invalid species. <lb/>We separate BMP4 sequences of each parental chromo-<lb/>some through molecular cloning and identify the putative <lb/>parental species of A. leucokranos as A. chrysopterus and <lb/> A. sandaracinos. This is consistent with field observations <lb/>[20]. The hybrid individuals that we sequenced are all <lb/>likely recent hybrids (possibly F1) because the two clones <lb/>can always be clearly separated and cluster with different <lb/>putative parental taxa. This suggests that genomic re-<lb/>arrangement occurring during reproductive events did not <lb/>yet occur. <lb/>The special social structure of clownfish may put some <lb/>behavioural constraints on hybridisation. Indeed, all clown-<lb/>fish species are protandrous hermaphrodites and live in so-<lb/>cial groups with size-based dominance hierarchy. The <lb/>female is the largest and dominant individual, the male the <lb/>second largest, and usually smaller non-breeding individ-<lb/>uals follow, decreasing in size relative to their hierarchical <lb/>position [28]. In certain cases [29-31], size differentiation <lb/>allows smaller species to cohabit with a larger species in <lb/>the same anemone. While reproduction of the smallest <lb/>species is largely suppressed by the presence of the largest <lb/>clownfish [32], species hybridisation cannot be fully ex-<lb/>cluded. In such instance, the size-based hierarchy ensure <lb/>that the female of a hybrid pair will most probably always <lb/>be the largest individual. This is what we observe in A. leu-<lb/>cokranos. The parental origin of the three other hybrids <lb/>does not allow for a definitive conclusion regarding this be-<lb/>havioural constraint. Indeed, the size difference between <lb/>species of the akallopisos group is small and cannot be <lb/>used as a diagnostic feature separating A. akalloposis, A. <lb/>pacificus and A. perideraion [33]. It is thus likely that the <lb/>behavioural constraint on hybridisation between those spe-<lb/>cies is going to be weaker than between species with large <lb/>size difference. <lb/> Geography of recent hybridisation <lb/> Hybrid zones appear when two species share such mar-<lb/>gins and have the possibility to exchange genes. At the <lb/>range margins, the probability of encountering a hetero-<lb/>specific mate is higher than that of meeting an individual <lb/>

			of its own species whenever an individual moves into the <lb/>range of the other species [34]. This will increase the prob-<lb/>ability of hybridisation events. As expected, A. leucokranos <lb/> is distributed at the edge of the two parental distributions <lb/>and hybrids 1 and 3 were found at the eastern edge of the <lb/>range of A. akallopisos (Figure 5). Further genetic sam-<lb/>pling would be necessary to better define those potential <lb/>hybrid zones. This would be of particular interest given <lb/>the evolutionary significance of hybridisation in animals, <lb/>as exemplified by the importance of exogenous selection <lb/>on contemporary hybrid zones [35]. <lb/> Conclusion <lb/> Hybridisation can impact speciation in many ways. Our <lb/>analyses show that in the case of the adaptive radiation <lb/>of the clownfishes, hybridisation events are linked with a <lb/>burst in diversification rate. We observe that hybridisa-<lb/>tion has occurred throughout the evolutionary history of <lb/>the group and is still happening. Further studies are re-<lb/>quired to measure the extant of ongoing hybrid speciation, <lb/>for example in A. leucokranos. There, field observations <lb/>coupled with experiments will allow to identify the condi-<lb/>tions in which hybrids have a better fitness than their par-<lb/>ents, illustrating the thight relationship linking species <lb/>ecology and evolutionary processes. <lb/> Methods <lb/> Phylogenetic reconstruction <lb/> We used previously extracted DNA from 41 individuals <lb/>(see [19] for details; Additional file 3: Table S1) repre-<lb/>senting 27 species of clownfish to analyse the evolution-<lb/>ary history of mitochondrial genes. We amplified parts <lb/>of the ATP86, CytB and 16S markers via polymerase <lb/>chain reaction (PCR) with a 25 μl reaction mixture con-<lb/>taining ~50 ng of DNA template, 2.5 μL GoTaq buffer, <lb/>3 μL dNTPs (2.5 μM), 1 MgCl2 (25 μM), 1 μL of both <lb/>forward and reverse primer and 0.3 μL of Taq polymer-<lb/>ase (GoTaq DNA Polymerase, Promega, Madison, WI). <lb/>Primer sequences and PCR cycles were set as in [24] for <lb/>ATP86 and CytB, and [25] for the 16S. We purified the <lb/>amplification products with the QIAquick PCR Purifica-<lb/>tion Kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany). We sequenced the <lb/>purified products forward and reverse strands with the <lb/>Big Dye 3.1 Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied <lb/>Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufac-<lb/>turer&apos;s instructions, and separated the products on an <lb/>ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems, <lb/>Foster City, CA). We assembled a nuclear dataset from <lb/>sequences generated in a previous study [19]; Additional <lb/>file 3: Table S1). The nuclear dataset is 6,679 base pairs <lb/>long and comports seven genes (BMP4, Glyt, Hox6, <lb/>RAG1, S7, Svep, Zic1). We used MAFFT 6.864b [36] <lb/>with default settings to align each mitochondrial and <lb/>nuclear gene individually. We verified each alignment <lb/>visually and concatenated the mitochondrial and nuclear <lb/>datasets in two separate super-matrices with Sequence-<lb/>Matrix [37]. We estimated the mitochondrial and nu-<lb/>clear phylogenetic relationships of clownfish species <lb/>with MrBayes 3.2.1 [38]. The parameters of the nucleo-<lb/>tide substitution process for each gene in the mitochon-<lb/>drial and nuclear data sets were sampled across the GTR <lb/>model space during the Bayesian MCMC [39]. This ap-<lb/>proach has the advantage of removing the need of a <lb/>priori testing for a specific model of substitution (e.g. <lb/>[40]). We performed, for each dataset, two independent <lb/>runs of MrBayes with four parallel MCMC chains, each <lb/>10 million generations long, and sampled model param-<lb/>eters every 1000 generations. We checked for optimal <lb/>parameter convergence using the &apos;sump&apos; command and <lb/>by visualising the trace files and the ESS values of the <lb/>MCMC chains using Tracer v 1.5 [41]. After the removal <lb/>of 25% of the trees as burn-in, we merged the two inde-<lb/>pendent runs to generate a majority-rule consensus tree <lb/>for both mitochondrial and nuclear dataset that included <lb/>all compatible groups. <lb/> Hybrid signal <lb/> We assessed cytonuclear discordance by comparing visu-<lb/>ally the topology of both consensus phylogenetic trees. <lb/>This step was facilitated by the use of the  &quot; cophyloplot &quot; <lb/> function available in the R package Ape [42]. We further <lb/>applied the framework of the HET on the nuclear data-<lb/>set only [6]. Hybrid taxa are intermediate to the parental <lb/>species when considering their nuclear genome, but they <lb/>share identical alleles at each individual locus with only <lb/>one parent [43]. When included in a phylogenetic tree <lb/>based on a matrix of concatenated nuclear markers, a <lb/>hybrid taxon will introduce an excess of homoplasy due <lb/>to the conflicting phylogenetic signal present in the cor-<lb/>responding gene tree topologies in the clades containing <lb/>the two parental species. Thus, the removal of a putative <lb/>hybrid should reduce conflicts in the phylogenetic tree <lb/>and result in increased support values for the nodes that <lb/>includes the parental species [6]. While AFLP have ini-<lb/>tially been proposed as input data for the HET, it is con-<lb/>ceptually similar to use the alignments of several nuclear <lb/>genes. The only drawback of using sequence data is a re-<lb/>duction in power due to the lower amount of data and <lb/>less independence between sites. Yet, by increasing the <lb/>number of genes studied, this should not be a major <lb/>issue. We implemented this test in R 3.0.1 [44] and used <lb/>RAxML 7.3.5 [45] to perform the phylogenetic inference <lb/>and bootstrap support (BS) using the &apos;GTRGAMMA&apos; <lb/> model of nucleotide substitution and specified a different <lb/>partition for each gene in the dataset. For a species i, we <lb/>first removed it from the complete concatenated align-<lb/>ment of nuclear data. We used this reduced data set <lb/>lacking species i to build a phylogenetic tree and <lb/>

			estimate node support with 100 bootstrap replicates. <lb/>Second, we generated a null distribution of BS for each <lb/>node of the consensus phylogenetic tree by removing at <lb/>random a species j that is different from the focal species <lb/> i, and inferred, again, the phylogenetic tree and BS. This <lb/>was replicated 100 times. Third, we compared the BS for <lb/>each node obtained by the reduced dataset lacking the <lb/>focal species i to those of the null distribution. We iden-<lb/>tified outlier values of BS when the BS of a node fell <lb/>above the highest value still within 1.5 interquartile <lb/>range of the upper quartile of the null distribution <lb/>[16,46]. This represent a case where the focal species i is <lb/>of hybrid origin which has the effect of reducing drastic-<lb/>ally the BS of the node ancestral to the parental species. <lb/>Finally, this process was carried on for each taxon in-<lb/>cluded in the phylogeny. At first, we performed this ana-<lb/>lysis using single species removals, but then extended the <lb/>framework to monophyletic pairs, triplets and so on, of <lb/>species (n up to 8) to account for hybrid species which <lb/>may have already further diversified into several descen-<lb/>dants. Each time, we removed n random species from the <lb/>dataset and generated a new null distribution of BS where <lb/> n random species were removed from the alignment. <lb/> Molecular cloning of recent hybrids <lb/> We obtained, through an aquarium fish importer, sam-<lb/>ples from three unidentified clownfish specimens that <lb/>displayed hybrid characteristics such as aberrant colour-<lb/>ation or shape. Hybrid 1 and 3 were collected in Bali, <lb/>Indonesia, while hybrid 2 originated from Papua New <lb/>Guinea. We followed the protocol described above to se-<lb/>quence, for each new sample, all three mitochondrial <lb/>markers and the nuclear gene BMP4. We further iso-<lb/>lated from those three individuals and a sample of A. <lb/>leucokranos (a species that may have been described <lb/>form hybrid individuals [20]), putative parental se-<lb/>quences of BMP4 using molecular cloning. We cloned <lb/>the purified PCR products of the BMP4 gene into the <lb/>pTZ57R/T vector using the InsT/Aclone PCR Product <lb/>Cloning Kit (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). Then, we <lb/>amplified up to 12 clones for each individual with the <lb/>M13 forward and reverse primers to ensure that we se-<lb/>quenced all existing variants. We purified and sequenced <lb/>the PCR products as above. We ensured, by checking <lb/>visually all chromatograms, that no sequence showed <lb/>double peaks, which would indicate heterozygous sites <lb/>and thus a failure of the cloning procedure. We assem-<lb/>bled identical clones in Geneious 6 (Biomatters), expect-<lb/>ing to recover two different sequences (one for each <lb/>parent) if the individual is truly a hybrid, or only one if <lb/>it is not the case. We aligned the mitochondrial and nu-<lb/>clear sequences of the hybrid individuals to the two <lb/>super-matrices with MAFFT [36]. Finally, we expected <lb/>clones to cluster with the sequences of their parental <lb/>species. We identified the putative parents of the indi-<lb/>viduals by reconstructing the phylogenetic trees of both <lb/>super-matrices using MrBayes 3.2.1 in the same manner <lb/>as described above. All newly generated sequences have <lb/>been deposited in the EMBL database (accession num-<lb/>bers in Additional file 3). <lb/>
