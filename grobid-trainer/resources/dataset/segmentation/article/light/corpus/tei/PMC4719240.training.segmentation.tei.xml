			<body>Ulnar / Radiopalmar pattern from Iranian population; <lb/>and we believe that this is first report from our geopolitical <lb/>area. <lb/>Clinically the anastomosis between radial and ulnar <lb/>arteries in hand is of great significance when performing <lb/>surgical procedures on hand, forearm or on individual <lb/>arteries. One of the complications of common procedure <lb/>of radial artery like arterial blood sampling is occlusion of <lb/>the artery, however in these situations the hand perfusion <lb/>can be maintained by the ulnar artery through the palmar <lb/>arch. This can be easily established by using Allen&apos;s test <lb/>[11] or Doppler ultrasound studies [12] which can <lb/>provide good idea about the continuity of the palmar <lb/>arches. In cases of incomplete palmar arch, as in this case, <lb/>the Allen&apos;s test will be negative confirmed with and both <lb/>radius and ulna arteries will behave as &apos;end arteries&apos;. Thus <lb/>any procedure on radial or ulnar artery needs to be <lb/>After proper skin incision and dissection of flexor carefully planned and potential of ischemic complications <lb/>retinaculum, palmar aponeurosis and deep fascia covering should be kept in mind. <lb/>the thenar and hypothenar muscles, we encountered an <lb/>incomplete type of SPA in the left upper extremity of a <lb/>In viewof high rate of road traffic injuries in Iran and need <lb/>formalin-fixed adult male cadaver during routine <lb/>for surgical intervention, the anatomic knowledge of the <lb/>dissection. The history of the individual and the cause of <lb/>SPA variability as a dominant vascular structure of palm <lb/>death was not known. In the present case, the brachial <lb/>becomes essential. <lb/>artery divided into RA and UA at the cubital fossa. There <lb/>was no anastomosis between RA and UA at palm of hand <lb/>and SPA was incomplete. UA gave three palmar digital <lb/>arteries; proper palmar digital artery and two common <lb/>palmar digital arteries which passed to the medial three <lb/>interdigital clefts. RA gave two branches: proper palmar <lb/>digital artery to the radial side of the index finger and an <lb/>arteria princeps pollicis (Fig. 1). <lb/>A classic morphology of complete SPA is formed by the <lb/>linkage between superficial palmar branches of the radial <lb/>and ulnar arteries. But other morphology of incomplete <lb/>SPA was reported. The incidence of the incomplete SPA <lb/>reported 10%, 16%, 16% and 21.47% of cases in studies of <lb/>Loukas, et al. (2005), Patnaik, et al. (2002), Al-turk and <lb/>Metcalf. (1984) and Coleman and Anson (1961), <lb/>respectively. Most of the SPA arches (54.76%), in the study <lb/>of Sarkar et al. (2012) were incomplete [3, 5-8]. <lb/>According to Ottone, et al. (2010) the present case is Ulnar <lb/>/ Radiopalmar pattern subtype of incomplete SPA (9). The <lb/>incidence of this variation reported in 8.3%, 3.2% and <lb/>3.6% of cases in studies of Ottone, et al. (2010), Coleman <lb/>and Anson (1961) and Ikeda et al. (1988) [9,3,10]. <lb/>There was no report of the incomplete SPA, especially <lb/></body>
