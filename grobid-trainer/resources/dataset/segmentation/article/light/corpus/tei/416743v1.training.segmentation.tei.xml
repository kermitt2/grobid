			<body>I. INTRODUCTION <lb/>RNA-binding proteins are major modulators of gene ex-<lb/>pression at the post-transcriptional level, where they control <lb/>RNA splicing, stability, localization, degradation, and trans-<lb/>lation [1,2]. For mRNAs, the role of RBPs in modulating <lb/>global changes in gene expression at both the RNA and <lb/>protein level becomes particularly important under conditions <lb/>where new gene transcription is repressed, such as during <lb/>inflammation, cell stress, and in response to genomic dam-<lb/>age [3-5]. In addition, mutations affecting the expression of <lb/>specific RBPs, or their function, have been implicated in a <lb/>variety of diseases, including cancer [5-8]. <lb/>RBPs appear to play an especially critical role in or-<lb/>chestrating the DNA damage response (DDR) by regulating <lb/>mRNA expression changes that control the onset and dura-<lb/>tion of cell cycle checkpoints and drive DNA repair [9-11]. <lb/>Recent large-scale screening efforts have converged on RBPs <lb/>as one of the most enriched classes of proteins modulating <lb/>the DDR, even more so than annotated DNA damage repair <lb/>proteins [12-16]. In addition, emerging evidence from our <lb/>lab and others has identified RBPs as critical targets of DDR <lb/>kinases, including both upstream responder kinases such as <lb/>ATM, ATR and DNA-PK, and downstream effector kinases <lb/>such as Chk1 and MK2 [12,13,17-19]. The discovery <lb/>of RBPs as integration points of the cellular response to <lb/>genomic damage has important clinical applications, since <lb/>the efficacy of many commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs <lb/>is dependent on the integrity (or lack thereof) of the DNA <lb/>damage response (DDR) [20,21]. For example, we found that <lb/>a key target of the DNA damage-activated MK2 pathway was <lb/>the RBP hnRNPA0, which was required for maintenance of <lb/>the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints following cisplatin treat-<lb/>ment [22,23]. Furthermore, this finding dictated the response <lb/>of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) to chemotherapy in <lb/>both mouse models and human patients, where the expression <lb/>levels of two critical hnRNPA0 target RNAs, Gadd45Î± and <lb/>p27, predicted the clinical response of mouse and human <lb/>tumors to platinum therapy. Despite these types of data, <lb/>and the recent surge of interest in the roles of RBPs in <lb/>cancer chemosensitivity and resistance [5,9,24], methods for <lb/>systematic prioritization of RBPs that influence the response <lb/>to therapy in diverse clinically relevant data sets are lacking. <lb/>Motivated by our long standing interest in the DNA <lb/>damage response, protein kinase signaling and the centrality <lb/>of RBPs in dictating cell death decisions in response to <lb/>chemotherapy, we developed Transite. Transite is a computa-<lb/>tional method that leverages the wealth of publicly available <lb/>gene expression data to infer RBPs influencing mRNA <lb/></body>

Schematic of the Transite analysis pipeline: The initial steps of the canonical Transite data analysis workflow include preprocessing and differential <lb/>expression analysis of gene expression profiles, which are usually obtained from NCBI and EMBL-EBI repositories such as GEO, SRA, and ENA. Differential <lb/>expression analysis is used to either identify groups of upregulated and downregulated genes (for Transcript Set Motif Analysis) or establish a ranked list <lb/>of genes from most upregulated to most downregulated (for Spectrum Motif Analysis). Transite then collects the sequences of all genes in the data set and <lb/>identifies RBPs whose targets concordantly change their expression level. <lb/>expression changes through modulation of mRNA stability. <lb/>Specifically, our method performs motif enrichment analysis <lb/>on a user-specified region of the mRNA, e.g., the 3 -UTR. <lb/>By identifying RBPs whose targets are overrepresented in <lb/>differentially-expressed genes, Transite nominates potential <lb/>RBP drivers of the observed gene expression changes, a <lb/>workflow that has been effective in the study of the kinases <lb/>associated with a particular biological stimulus [25]. A <lb/>schematic overview of the Transite pipeline is shown in <lb/>figure 1. <lb/>Application of Transite to a NSCLC patient data set of <lb/>chemoresistant tumors identified hnRNPC as a top putative <lb/>driver of increased mRNA levels in resistant patients. An <lb/>orthogonal analysis of hnRNPC-target mRNAs derived from <lb/>CLIP-Seq data confirmed upregulation of hnRNPC-target <lb/>mRNAs identified by our in silico approach. We then exper-<lb/>imentally validated that knock-down of hnRNPC enhanced <lb/>cisplatin-induced cell death in vitro, while hnRNPC over-<lb/>expression reduced cisplatin induced cell death. Furthermore, <lb/>high levels of hnRNPC expression were associated with <lb/>failure to respond to adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy <lb/>in an independent NSCLC patient cohort. <lb/>Since the data input requirements for using Transite are <lb/>very general, the approach is not limited to DNA damage <lb/>or cancer chemotherapy responses, but instead Transite can <lb/>take advantage of the plethora of publicly available gene <lb/>expression data sets for any perturbation, and can be used to <lb/>investigate the effects of RBPs on gene expression using the <lb/>result of any experiment measuring the expression levels of <lb/>large numbers of genes simultaneously. Most prominently, <lb/>these include RNA-Seq, ribosome profiling and microarray <lb/>experiments. Transite is a versatile tool for inferring the <lb/>RBPs modulating gene expression and as such, should be <lb/>a valuable resource for the entire RNA community. <lb/>II. MATERIALS AND METHODS <lb/>A. Differential gene expression analysis <lb/>The analysis was done with the R/Bioconductor package <lb/>limma [26]. The design matrix for this analysis contains <lb/>two sample groups, untreated adenocarcinoma (10 microar-<lb/>ray samples) and recurrent adenocarcinoma (15 microarray <lb/>samples). A linear model was fit to each row of the log 2 -<lb/>transformed expression value matrix, where rows correspond <lb/>to transcripts and columns correspond to samples. The <lb/>coefficients of the fitted models describe the differences <lb/>between the untreated adenocarcinoma and recurrent adeno-<lb/>carcinoma groups. An empirical Bayes method was used to <lb/>obtain the significance and the strength of the log fold change <lb/>between sample groups for each transcript [27], resulting in <lb/>an estimate of the fold-change analysis between groups and <lb/>the significance of the change. Raw p-values were adjusted <lb/>using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [28]. <lb/>B. Motif databases <lb/>Transite incorporates sequence motifs of RBP binding <lb/>sites from two databases: CIS-BP, the Catalog of Inferred <lb/>Sequence Binding Preferences [29], and RBPDB, a database <lb/>of RNA-binding specificities [30]. Together these contribute <lb/>174 sequence motifs of varying lengths (between six and <lb/>18 nucleotides). All motifs were obtained using in vitro <lb/>techniques for determining RNA targets. The majority of <lb/>motifs was determined by either systematic evolution of <lb/>ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) [31] or RNA-<lb/>compete [32]. The RNA binding specificities of two further <lb/>RBPs were obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assays <lb/>(EMSA) [33]. <lb/>C. Motif representations <lb/>Motif descriptions provided from the databases described <lb/>above were converted from count matrices to position weight <lb/></body>

			<page>2 <lb/></page>

			<body>matrices (PWMs), obtained by normalizing each nucleotide&apos;s <lb/>probability at each position by the mean probability of each <lb/>nucleotide, 25%. <lb/>For k-mer-based analyses, PWMs were converted to hex-<lb/>amers and heptamers by generating all k-mers for which each <lb/>position has a probability higher than a certain threshold. In <lb/>the work presented here, we used a threshold probability of <lb/>0.215, which is a stringency level that works well empirically <lb/>with the motifs from the motif databases. <lb/>Laplace smoothing (also known as additive smoothing) is <lb/>applied to avoid zeros in count matrices before conversion <lb/>to PWMs. Zeros might occur if the number of sequences on <lb/>which the PSSM is based, is too small to contain at least <lb/>one occurrence of each nucleotide per position. In this case, <lb/>pseudocounts are introduced [34]. <lb/>D. CLIP-seq data analysis <lb/>The BED files (output from Piranha analysis) for <lb/>all CLIP-Seq data sets were downloaded from CLIPdb <lb/>(http://lulab.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/clipdb/). Read counts were <lb/>mapped to RefSeq identifiers using a UCSC table with <lb/>either just 3 -UTR sequences or the entire mature mRNA of <lb/>all human mRNAs in Hg19 coordinates. RefSeq identifiers <lb/>were then summarized to gene symbols. For gene symbols <lb/>with multiple RefSeq identifiers, the one with the maximum <lb/>counts was taken, as it was assumed this indicated the <lb/>most highly expressed transcript. This analysis created two <lb/>gene lists, one where there was binding in the 3 -UTR (3 -<lb/>UTR targets) or where there was binding in any region of <lb/>the mRNA (entire mature mRNA targets). These gene lists <lb/>were then merged with fold change lists from GEO gene <lb/>expression data set GSE7880. To generate the non-targets <lb/>list, the entire mature mRNA list was subtracted from the <lb/>GSE7880 list. <lb/>E. Package and web development <lb/>R package development and documentation was stream-<lb/>lined with devtools and roxygen2, respectively. Core algo-<lb/>rithms were implemented in C++. ggplot2 [35] was used for <lb/>data visualization. <lb/>The website was developed in R with the reactive web <lb/>application framework shiny from RStudio. The components <lb/>of the graphical user interface were provided by shiny and <lb/>shinyBS, which serves as an R wrapper for the Twitter <lb/>Bootstrap HTML/CSS/JavaScript components. <lb/>F. Cell culture and colony formation assays <lb/>T6a (mouse lung adenocarcinoma) cells were grown in <lb/>RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine <lb/>serum at 37 â¢ C in a humidified incubator supplied with <lb/>5 % CO 2 . Colony formation assays were performed as <lb/>previously described [22]. Briefly, 48 hours after transfection <lb/>with siRNAs or pcDNA vectors, cells were treated with <lb/>either 4 or 8 Î¼M cisplatin or vehicle for 4 hours. Cells <lb/>were then re-plated in 6-well plates using 1000 mock-treated <lb/>or 10,000 cisplatin-treated cells per well. In overexpression <lb/>assays, 500 Î¼g/ml G418 was added to the media to select <lb/>for cells transfected with pcDNA vectors. After 10 to 14 <lb/>days, cells were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde and stained <lb/>with either SYTO 60 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or modified <lb/>Wright-stain (Sigma-Aldrich). Colonies were scanned and <lb/>counted using Odyssey R CLx Imaging System (LI-COR <lb/>Biosciences). <lb/>G. siRNA transfection <lb/>Silencer select siRNAs (Ambion) transfection was per-<lb/>formed using RNAiMax following manufacturer instructions <lb/>(Life Technologies) with a final concentration of 5 nM. Cells <lb/>were then treated as described in the previous section. <lb/>H. Overexpression of hnRNPC <lb/>pcDNA3.1 vectors expressing FLAG-tagged mouse <lb/>hnRNPC were generated as follows. First, total RNA was <lb/>prepared from KP7B (mouse lung carcinoma) cells using <lb/>RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen) and was used to synthesize <lb/>cDNAs using Superscript cDNA Synthesis System (Life <lb/>Technologies). cDNAs were used as templates in PCR <lb/>reactions using PfuUltra II HF DNA polymerase (Agilent) <lb/>and the following primers: 5 -GCCCATAAGCTTATG-<lb/>GACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGCTAGCAAT-<lb/>GTTACCAACAAGACAGATCCTCGG-3 (forward) and <lb/>5 -GCCCATTCTAGATTATTAAGAGTCATCCTCCCCA-<lb/>TTGGCGCTGTCTCTG-3 (reverse). Restriction sites for <lb/>HindIII (in forward primer) and XbaI (in reverse primer) <lb/>are in bold. Sequences encoding FLAG are underlined. <lb/>The PCR products were cleaved with the indicated <lb/>restriction enzymes (New England BioLabs Inc), purified <lb/>(QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) and sub-cloned <lb/>into pcDNA3.1 vectors. The integrity of the plasmids were <lb/>confirmed by sequencing (Eton Bioscience Inc). <lb/>I. Immunoblotting <lb/>Cells were harvested 24 (siRNA transfected) or 48 <lb/>(pcDNA vectors transfected) hours after cisplatin treatment <lb/>and re-plating. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer and <lb/>subjected to standard SDS/PAGE electrophoresis and trans-<lb/>ferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were <lb/>immunoblotted with hnRNPC (ab10294, Abcam Inc., Cam-<lb/>bridge, MA) and Î³-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) following man-<lb/>ufacturers instructions. <lb/>III. RESULTS <lb/>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) influence all stages of the <lb/>mRNA life cycle through specific interactions involving <lb/>short linear sequence motifs containing 6 -8 nucleotides <lb/>within their target RNAs [36]. The identity of these RBP-<lb/>binding motifs has been determined for a subset of all <lb/>known RBPs using various in vitro based oligonucleotide <lb/>selection methods such as SELEX [31], RNAcompete [32] <lb/>and Bind-n-Seq [37], and directly confirmed for a smaller <lb/>set of RBPs through experimental analysis of RBP-RNA <lb/>interactions using CLIP-Seq and various extensions thereof. <lb/>These latter techniques are laborious and costly to perform, <lb/>and the direct experimental identification of the complete set <lb/></body>

			<body>of RNA targets for most RBPs is therefore not yet known. <lb/>Furthermore, identification of these RNA targets are likely <lb/>to differ depending upon the experimental situation under <lb/>which CLIP-Seq was performed. This has limited our ability <lb/>to understand which RBPs are critical mediators of changes <lb/>in RNA levels in pre-existing gene expression datasets like <lb/>those contained in the gene expression omnibus (GEO), <lb/>including cancer-relevant datasets that describe treatment <lb/>responses. <lb/>In order to systematically mine these existing data sets <lb/>for RBPs that may influence gene expression changes, with <lb/>a focus of patient response to therapy, we have developed <lb/>Transite. Transite takes either a discrete set of differentially <lb/>expressed genes, or a continuous list of genes, and searches <lb/>for enriched short linear oligonucleotide motifs within spe-<lb/>cific regions of the transcripts they encode, and then matches <lb/>these motifs to the likely RBP that binds them using a com-<lb/>pendium of RBP motifs. By default, Transite uses 3 -UTR <lb/>sequences, as our major focus is mRNA stability and motifs <lb/>that determine mRNA stability are known to generally reside <lb/>within the 3 -UTR. Gene sets used for Transite analysis can <lb/>be defined in either a discrete or a continuous fashion. For <lb/>discrete sets of genes we implement Transcript Set Motif <lb/>Analysis, which takes the predefined sets of transcripts such <lb/>as upregulated and downregulated transcripts and performs <lb/>motif analysis based on systematic differences between these <lb/>sets and the total gene expression data. For continuous <lb/>collections of genes we developed Spectrum Motif Analysis, <lb/>which uses a continuous quantity to establish an ordered <lb/>ranking of transcripts and analyzes motif enrichment along <lb/>that ordered list of transcripts, similar to the approach taken <lb/>by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis [38]. For this continuous <lb/>quantity, a measure of differential expression is commonly <lb/>used, such as fold change or signal-to-noise ratio, thus <lb/>exploiting information across the entire spectrum of changes <lb/>rather than limiting analysis to the up-and down-regulated <lb/>extremes. <lb/>A. Transcript Set Motif Analysis identifies RBPs with sub-<lb/>strate sites enriched or depleted among differentially ex-<lb/>pressed genes <lb/>Transcript Set Motif Analysis (TSMA) can identify the <lb/>overrepresentation or underrepresentation of putative binding <lb/>sites of 174 RNA-binding proteins in a set (or sets) of <lb/>transcripts, i.e., the foreground set, relative to the entire <lb/>population of transcripts measured in an experiment. The <lb/>latter is called background set, and is a proper superset of <lb/>the foreground sets. <lb/>Foreground sets are proper subsets of the background set <lb/>and their definition depends on the desired motif analysis <lb/>approach. In any case, foreground and background sets define <lb/>the groups of transcripts wherein the overrepresentation <lb/>and underrepresentation of putative RBP binding sites is <lb/>investigated. <lb/>When gene expression data is used, the two foreground <lb/>sets for TSMA are usually the statistically significantly <lb/>upregulated and downregulated transcripts. (Figure 2A). Var-<lb/>ious deviations of this canonical use of foreground sets are <lb/>possible. Upregulated and downregulated sets can be defined <lb/>in various ways, depending on the method of differential <lb/>expression analysis [39]. It is not even necessary to use <lb/>gene expression data to define foreground and background <lb/>transcripts. For example, all human or all murine genes as-<lb/>sociated with a certain Gene Ontology (GO) [40] term could <lb/>be compared to all genes of human or mouse, respectively, <lb/>which are annotated with at least one GO term, to identify <lb/>RBPs associated with particular ontological terms. <lb/>Two different methods are used to assign transcript targets <lb/>to specific RBPs, k-mer-based TSMA and matrix-based <lb/>TSMA. <lb/>B. k-mer-based TSMA <lb/>In the k-mer based approach of TSMA the sequence motifs <lb/>recognized by each RBP are specified by lists of RBP-<lb/>specific hexamers or heptamers, collated from current motif <lb/>databases [29,30]. <lb/>After foreground and background sets are defined and the <lb/>preferred sequence region is selected (3 -UTR, 5 -UTR, or <lb/>complete mature mRNA including the coding region), the <lb/>sequences of both sets are broken down into overlapping <lb/>hexamers (i.e., k-mers of length 6) (Figure 2B, left column), <lb/>and for each k-mer its frequency in the foreground set <lb/>and background set is determined. While Transite supports <lb/>both hexamer-and heptamer-matching, hexamers are recom-<lb/>mended, since run-time increases exponentially with k and <lb/>the results for heptamers mirror those for hexamers in our <lb/>experience. <lb/>1) k-mer enrichment values: The enrichment value of k-<lb/>mer i, e i , is calculated as follows: <lb/>e i = <lb/>f i /n F <lb/>b i /n B <lb/>, <lb/>where f i and b i are the absolute counts of k-mer i in <lb/>foreground and background set and n F and n B are the <lb/>total counts of k-mers in the foreground and background, <lb/>respectively. <lb/>2) Significance of k-mer enrichment values: The statisti-<lb/>cal significance of the enrichment for all possible k-mers is <lb/>then determined. First, a contingency table C i for k-mer i is <lb/>defined as <lb/>C i = <lb/>f i (n F â f i ) <lb/>b i (n B â b i ) <lb/>. <lb/>Then, the p-value p i for C i is approximated with Pearson&apos;s <lb/>Ï 2 test. If p i &lt; 5Î±, p i is replaced by the p-value obtained by <lb/>Fisher&apos;s exact test for C i . This step-wise procedure reduces <lb/>computation time dramatically (approximately 50-fold), be-<lb/>cause the computationally expensive Fisher&apos;s exact test is <lb/>only used in cases where the approximate p-value from the <lb/>computationally inexpensive Ï 2 test is close to the decision <lb/>boundary (Î±) and is avoided in cases where a precise p-value <lb/>is unnecessary. Furthermore, Fisher&apos;s exact test is always <lb/>used if at least one of the expected counts is less than five, <lb/>because this constitutes a violation of the assumptions of the <lb/>approximate test. The p-values are subsequently adjusted for <lb/></body>

The PWM slides along <lb/>the sequence, assigns a score to each position, and scores <lb/>above a certain threshold are considered putative binding <lb/>sites (hits). These hits are tallied in both the foreground and <lb/>the background set and enrichment values and associated <lb/>p-values are calculated analogously to the k-mer-based ap-<lb/>proach. Again, all p-values are multiple testing corrected. <lb/>A disadvantage of the matrix-based TSMA method relative <lb/>to the k-mer-based approach is that a PWM assumes inde-<lb/>pendence among positions, making it impossible to construct <lb/>a PWM that assigns high scores to AAAAAA and CCCCCC, <lb/>but a low score to ACACAC. <lb/>An advantage of our matrix-based approach is the possibil-<lb/>ity of detecting clusters of putative binding sites. This can be <lb/>done by counting regions with many hits using positional hit <lb/>information or by simply applying a hit count threshold per <lb/>sequence, e.g., only sequences with more than some number <lb/>of hits are considered. Homotypic clusters of RBP binding <lb/>sites may play a similar role as clusters of transcription <lb/>factors [41]. <lb/>D. Spectrum Motif Analysis identifies RBPs with nonrandom <lb/>arrangement of substrate sites in a ranked list of transcripts. <lb/>A limitation of the TSMA method described above is that <lb/>it will only capture those RBPs for which putative substrate <lb/>sequences are statistically significantly enriched among a <lb/>foreground defined using a collection of either the most or <lb/>least differentially-regulated genes. As an alternative method, <lb/>we present Spectrum Motif Analysis (SPMA), which is an <lb/>effort to more broadly and generally identify non-random <lb/>distributions of RBP substrate sequences in an ordered list <lb/>of genes without having to pre-define a specific foreground <lb/>set (compare Figures 2A and 3A). <lb/>Instead of using an arbitrary threshold (e.g., p-value less <lb/>than or equal to 0.05) to assign transcripts to a single <lb/>foreground set, SPMA subdivides the entire list of rank-<lb/>ordered transcripts into a number of foreground sets (bins) <lb/>of equal width, calculates enrichment scores for k-mers or <lb/>PWM motifs in each bin as described above, and then <lb/>searches for non-random bin-wise assortment of k-mer or <lb/>matrix hit frequencies associated with individual RBPs. <lb/>SPMA thereby helps to illuminate the relationship between <lb/>RBP binding evidence (putative binding site enrichment) and <lb/>the transcript sorting criterion (e.g., fold change between <lb/>treatment and control samples). Figure 3A illustrates how <lb/>the sorted list of transcripts is divided into bins. <lb/>1) Spectrum plots: The results of SPMA are displayed <lb/>as spectrum plots, compact graphical representations of the <lb/>distribution of putative binding sites for a single RBP, across <lb/>a range of transcripts (which are sorted in a meaningful way). <lb/>A spectrum plot visualizes putative binding site enrichment <lb/>or depletion, and associated p-values, for an RBP motif <lb/>across the spectrum of transcripts. Spectrum plots are one-<lb/>dimensional heatmaps, where red-blue coloring encodes the <lb/>putative binding site enrichment values and the columns <lb/>are the individual bins of transcripts. Significance levels are <lb/>indicated by one, two, or three asterisks (p-value less than <lb/>or equal to 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively). Examples of <lb/>spectrum plots are shown in panels B and C of figure 3. <lb/>2) Spectrum plot classification: SPMA generates one <lb/>spectrum plot for each RBP motif in the motif database. With <lb/>174 motifs currently available, it is imperative to provide a <lb/>means to aid in the identification of biologically meaningful <lb/>spectrum plots that exhibit non-random patterns. A typical <lb/>non-random pattern is shown in the first spectrum plot in <lb/>figure 3C, where the enrichment values are observed to <lb/>positively correlate with the sorting criterion. This type of <lb/>positive linear relationship between RBP motif enrichment <lb/>values and sorting criterion might arise in a situation where <lb/>transcripts are sorted according to their fold change between <lb/>treatment and control groups and the target transcripts of <lb/>the RBP are collectively upregulated in the treatment group, <lb/>perhaps via stabilization by the RBP itself. Transite further <lb/>aids the user in the process of identifying spectrum plots <lb/>with a meaningful pattern-one that might be indicative <lb/>of an underlying biological process-by separating them <lb/>from spectrum plots with more random distributions of motif <lb/>enrichment, which are more likely to occur by chance. Each <lb/>spectrum plot is automatically labeled either non-random or <lb/>random, based on three criteria. (1) the adjusted R 2 of a poly-<lb/>nomial model fit, (2) the local consistency score, and (3) the <lb/>number of bins with a significant enrichment or depletion of <lb/>putative binding sites. For (1), polynomial regression models <lb/></body>

			<body>chemotherapy (GEO Series accession GSE7880) in order to <lb/>prioritize RBPs that may influence the response of these <lb/>patients to chemotherapy. We ranked the gene expression <lb/>changes between pre-treatment and recurrent patients based <lb/>on signal-to-noise ratio where transcripts present in higher <lb/>quantities in recurrent patients had positive values and <lb/>those upregulated in naive patients had negative values (see <lb/>Figure 5A for schematic). The results of k-mer-based and <lb/>matrix-based TSMA and SPMA (including all 174 motifs) <lb/>are available as sample output on the Transite website, <lb/>About page, Example output section. Ranking the Transite <lb/>output of both SPMA runs by adjusted R squared (ARS) <lb/>revealed ELAVL1 and TIA1 to be among the top RBPs <lb/>predicted to be associated with the 3 -UTRs of transcripts <lb/>upregulated in recurrent patients relative to untreated patients <lb/>(Figure 5B shows top 10 RBPs in k-mer-based SPMA). <lb/>Individual spectrum plots for ELAVL1 (Figure 5C) or TIA1 <lb/>(Figure 5D) demonstrated consistent behavior of these motifs <lb/>across the gene expression continuum, being enriched in <lb/>3 -UTRs of genes that are up in recurrent patients and <lb/>depleted in 3 -UTRs of genes that are up in naive patients. <lb/>Importantly, upregulation of ELAVL1 and TIA1-target mR-<lb/>NAs was further validated by analyzing the distribution of <lb/>known CLIP-Seq identified targets [42,43] for these two <lb/>RBPs (Figure 5E and 5F). Moreover, both ELAVL1 [44] <lb/>and TIA1 [45] are known to be involved in the DNA damage <lb/>response. The fact that two well-known players in the DNA <lb/>damage response are among the top hits of the motif analysis <lb/>provides confidence that Transite&apos;s predictions are likely to <lb/>reflect bona fide regulators of the DNA damage response <lb/>and drivers of chemoresistance. Although CLIP-Seq-defined <lb/>target mRNAs remain the gold standard for known RBP <lb/>targets, there are very few RBPs that have been subjected <lb/>to extensive CLIP-Seq analysis. In the absence of this data, <lb/>Transite currently utilizes information about putative binding <lb/>sites from 174 motifs, covering 142 distinct RBPs. Therefore, <lb/>Transite presents the possibility of identifying RBPs whose <lb/>true targets as identified by CLIP-Seq and related methods <lb/>are currently unknown, thus nominating novel RBPs as <lb/>putative modulators of chemoresistance or other biological <lb/>processes, in order to prioritize those RBPs for further <lb/>analysis by CLIP. <lb/>G. Motif analysis of the non-small cell lung cancer response <lb/>to cisplatin treatment identfies hnRNPC as a potential mod-<lb/>ulator of resistance to chemotherapy <lb/>The data in Figure 5 shows that Transite analysis can <lb/>identify known RBPs involved in the DNA damage response. <lb/>We were particularly interested in using Transite as a tool <lb/>to discover new biology related to the DDR in data from <lb/>human clinical trials. We therefore focused on hnRNPC, <lb/>one of the highest-scoring RBPs that emerged from our <lb/>analysis of chemoresistant NSCLC patients, and has not <lb/>to our knowledge been strongly implicated in the response <lb/>to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage [46]. As shown in <lb/>Figure 6A, the spectrum plot of the distribution of putative <lb/>hnRNPC binding sites shows a strong enrichment of mRNAs <lb/>with hnRNPC motifs in their 3 -UTRs in patients with tumor <lb/>recurrence after platinum therapy. This Transite prediction <lb/>was independently confirmed by analysis of iCLIP-defined <lb/>target mRNAs [47], which also showed an overrepresentation <lb/>of hnRNPC targets in upregulated transcripts in recurrent <lb/>patients (Figure 6B), with those with binding in the 3 -UTR <lb/>showing the strongest enrichment. <lb/>H. hnRNPC modulates sensitivity to cisplatin <lb/>To experimentally validate these Transite results, we ex-<lb/>amined the effect of knockdown or over-expression of hn-<lb/>RNPC on sensitivity to cisplatin treatment in T6a murine <lb/>lung carcinoma cells. Colony formation assays in T6a cells <lb/>demonstrated that hnRNPC over-expression promoted re-<lb/>sistance to cisplatin as evidenced by a 1.6 fold increase <lb/>in the number of surviving colonies (Figure 6C, red bar). <lb/>Conversely, siRNA-downregulation of hnRNPC significantly <lb/>enhanced T6a cell sensitivity to cisplatin as evidenced by a <lb/>5-fold decrease in the number of colonies formed by cells <lb/>treated with hnRNPC siRNA compared to those of control <lb/>siRNA-treated cells after cisplatin treatment (Figure 6C, blue <lb/>bar). These data indicate that hnRNPC is a key player in <lb/>mediating resistance of NSCLC cells to chemotherapy, and <lb/>demonstrate that our computational approach can identify <lb/>new RBPs influencing the DDR. To independently vali-<lb/>date the importance of hnRNPC in mediating chemother-<lb/>apy response in patients, we took advantage of a unique <lb/>adjuvant chemotherapy trial, JBR.10 (Figure 6D). In this <lb/>trial, early stage NSCLC patients had their tumors surgi-<lb/>cally resected and subjected to gene expression profiling. <lb/>Patients were then randomized to receive cisplatin / vi-<lb/>norelbine doublet chemotherapy or observation and palliative <lb/>care [48](GSE14814), allowing us to specifically assess <lb/>the role of hnRNPC in the response to chemotherapy. We <lb/>focused our analysis on stage 2 patients, as their benefit from <lb/>adjuvant chemotherapy is most pronounced. Separation of <lb/>patients based on hnRNPC expression revealed that patients <lb/>whose tumors display low expression of hnRNPC benefited <lb/>significantly from chemotherapy in terms of survival (Fig-<lb/>ure 6D, right panel, p = 0.019) while patients whose tumors <lb/>have high hnRNPC expression did not benefit (Figure 6D, <lb/>left panel, p = 0.68). Together these data define hnRNPC <lb/>as an important new RBP involved in the chemotherapeutic <lb/>response in NSCLC and suggest that Transite is a highly <lb/>effective tool to pinpoint novel RBPs that drive chemoresis-<lb/>tance in human cancer patients. <lb/>IV. DISCUSSION <lb/>Despite their crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation <lb/>of gene expression, the majority of RNA-binding proteins <lb/>(RBPs) have unknown functions. To help understand the <lb/>influence of RBPs on their target transcripts, we developed <lb/>Transite, a novel computational method for the analysis of <lb/>the regulatory role of RBPs in various cellular processes <lb/>for which differential gene expression data, or other rele-<lb/>vant gene sets are available. Our analysis is based on the <lb/>fact that most RBPs recognize short linear oligonucleotide <lb/></body>

Furthermore, their in <lb/>vitro-derived motifs may not always reflect motifs derived <lb/>from in vivo binding analysis. These caveats have raised <lb/>questions about the ability of consensus motifs and PWMs <lb/>to accurately predict RBP targets a priori on a genome-wide <lb/>scale, and have led to the development of more sophisticated <lb/>approaches for predicting specific RBP RNA targets [49,50]. <lb/>In contrast, Transite does not make any specific RBP RNA <lb/>target predictions, and instead simply looks at the statistical <lb/>distribution of RBP motif representation in sets of expressed <lb/>genes to infer putative roles for specific RBPs in some <lb/>biological process. <lb/>By using two approaches to identify non-random distri-<lb/>butions of RBP-binding motifs, followed by back-mapping <lb/>of those motifs onto those of 174 known RBPs, Transite <lb/>identified 3 RBPs involved in the human DDR which we <lb/>could further validate based on independent CLIP-Seq data <lb/>of their known mRNA targets in cells, rather than using mo-<lb/></body>

			<body>tifs derived from in vitro sequence libraries. These findings <lb/>suggest that, although there are limitations to utilizing in <lb/>vitro-derived motifs, Transite serves as an excellent discovery <lb/>tool for new biology. Moreover, since users can define their <lb/>own motifs in addition to those from the database, users are <lb/>able to upload motifs from CLIP-Seq data of their favorite <lb/>RBP and use that as a means to analyze enrichment in <lb/>preexisting data sets. <lb/>To further demonstrate the utility of Transite, we per-<lb/>formed an analysis of human NSCLC patient data we were <lb/>able to recover previously-known biology and also identify <lb/>novel sources of chemoresistance. Well-known players in the <lb/>DNA damage response such as ELAVL1 and TIA1 were <lb/>among the top hits in the tumor resistance gene expression <lb/>data set, showing that our approach is consistent with previ-<lb/>ous DNA damage response literature. Transite was also able <lb/>to identify hnRNPC as a new potential modulator of cisplatin <lb/>sensitivity in NSCLC patients. Experimental validation of the <lb/>in silico prediction further provides independent support for <lb/>a critical role for hnRNPC in mediating resistance of NSCLC <lb/>cells to chemotherapy, which was independently validated in <lb/>an additional NSCLC patients data set. <lb/>Transite is a versatile tool that can be used with any type <lb/>of gene expression data, the only requirements being a list <lb/>of gene identifiers and some means to separate foreground <lb/>and background sets or rank the gene list. Examples of types <lb/>of data users may utilize Transite to analyze are: (1) search-<lb/>ing for RBP motif enrichment in 5 or 3 -UTRs of genes <lb/>whose translational efficiency changes in response to some <lb/>stimulus as measured by ribosome or polysome profiling. <lb/>(2) searching for enrichment of RBP motifs in mRNAs that <lb/>are localized to specific sub-cellular compartments. (3) de <lb/>novo motif analysis in the entire mRNA of gene expression <lb/>changes upon knockdown of a nuclease of unknown function. <lb/>These are just a few examples of the versatility of Transite. <lb/>The Transite website (https://transite.mit.edu) makes this tool <lb/>accessible to a broad group of scientists and provides insight <lb/>as to how key post-transcriptional regulators contribute to <lb/>the concerted regulation and function of specific cellular <lb/>processes. With Transite, the large body of gene expression <lb/>data from microarray and RNA sequencing experiments can <lb/>be further leveraged to identify changes in mRNA expression <lb/>associated with specific RBPs. In this way, hypotheses can <lb/>be generated regarding which RBPs interact preferentially <lb/>with mRNAs that are specific to a particular condition. <lb/></body>
