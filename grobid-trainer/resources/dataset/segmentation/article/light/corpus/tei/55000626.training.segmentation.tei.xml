			<body>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging tech-<lb/>niques for the study of cerebral perfusion <lb/>have been developed and used clinically <lb/>to detect and assess the severity of isch-<lb/>emic stroke prior to treatment. By using <lb/>tracer kinetic models and dynamic sus-<lb/>ceptibility contrast MR imaging, perfu-<lb/>sion parameters were derived from the <lb/>signal intensity changes in the brain fol-<lb/>lowing the intravenous injection of a bo-<lb/>lus of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. <lb/>Typically, a time series of multi-phase <lb/>echo-planar, T2*-or T2-weighted images <lb/>are acquired and used to derive paramet-<lb/>ric maps of relative cerebral blood flow <lb/>(CBF), mean transit time (MTT), and rel-<lb/>ative cerebral blood volume (CBV) (1-3). <lb/>In cases of hyperacute stroke, these per-<lb/>fusion images have been shown to be <lb/>more accurate for prediction of the areas <lb/>destined for infarction than commonly <lb/>used diffusion-weighted images (4). <lb/>Ostergaard and co-workers (5,6) and <lb/>Wirestam et al (7) have shown that an ac-<lb/>curate determination of relative CBF is <lb/>possible by using MR imaging methods <lb/>through mathematical deconvolution of <lb/>a tissue concentration curve with an ar-<lb/>terial input function (AIF). In current im-<lb/>plementations of the MR imaging per-<lb/>fusion study, the AIF is determined <lb/>interactively on the basis of an operator-<lb/>chosen region of interest that is assumed <lb/>to represent signal intensity changes in a <lb/>large feeding vessel, such as the middle <lb/>cerebral artery (6,7). Some groups have <lb/>proposed methods to calculate an AIF <lb/>from the time of arrival of the contrast <lb/>material and the time course of signal <lb/>intensity changes in the proximal carotid <lb/>artery (8). In both of these approaches, <lb/>off-line postprocessing of the MR perfusion <lb/>data is required, and this postprocessing <lb/>necessitates additional time, a dedicated <lb/>workstation, and specially trained opera-<lb/>tors. These additional steps and the need <lb/>for advanced training could pose practical <lb/>barriers to widespread clinical application <lb/>of dynamic susceptibility contrast MR im-<lb/>aging perfusion techniques. <lb/>We have developed a means of deter-<lb/>mining AIF with dynamic susceptibility <lb/>contrast MR imaging on the basis of <lb/>adaptive thresholding. The purpose of <lb/>this study was to compare the AIFs calcu-<lb/>lated with an automated method with-<lb/>out operator input with those calculated <lb/>with the conventional interactively de-<lb/>termined region of interest-based method <lb/>and to determine if the automated method <lb/>provided technically adequate results in <lb/>clinical practice. <lb/>Materials and Methods <lb/>Patients and Image Acquisition <lb/>Patient records were reviewed in a con-<lb/>secutive series of 100 patients (46 male, <lb/>54 female; mean age, 49.3 years Ϯ 19.2 <lb/></body>

This study <lb/>was approved by our institutional review <lb/>board, and informed consent was not re-<lb/>quired. The perfusion images were pro-<lb/>cessed with the automated AIF method <lb/>and with the conventional user-defined <lb/>AIF method, according to the standard <lb/>protocol of the institution. In all cases, <lb/>diffusion-weighted images (b ϭ 1,000 <lb/>sec/mm 2 ) and fluid-attenuated inver-<lb/>sion-recovery T2-and T1-weighted con-<lb/>trast material-enhanced images were ob-<lb/>tained and compared with the perfusion <lb/>images. Standard 1.5-T MR imagers (Signa <lb/>Advantage and CV/i; GE Medical Sys-<lb/>tems, Wakesau, Wis) were used. For the <lb/>perfusion study, images were acquired in <lb/>the transverse plane with two-dimen-<lb/>sional gradient-recalled-echo single-shot <lb/>echo-planar imaging with the following <lb/>parameters: repetition time msec/echo <lb/>time (TE) msec, 2,000/60; flip angle, 60°; <lb/>field of view, 24 cm; readout resolution, <lb/>128 steps; phase-encoding values, 64; <lb/>and section thickness, 7 mm. Thirty-six <lb/>whole-head images were obtained (imag-<lb/>ing time, 73 seconds) per subject. An in-<lb/>jection of 0.1 mmol per kilogram of body <lb/>weight of the contrast agent gadodia-<lb/>mide (Omniscan; Amersham Health, <lb/>Princeton, NJ) was administered at 2.0 -<lb/>4.0 mL/sec, followed by a saline flush by <lb/>using a power injector (Spectris; Medrad, <lb/>Indianola, Pa) 13 seconds after initiation <lb/>of imaging. <lb/>Automated AIF <lb/>The details of the automated AIF algo-<lb/>rithm (9) appear as an Appendix to this <lb/>report. In short, the automated AIF algo-<lb/>rithm identifies a single voxel to repre-<lb/>sent the AIF on the basis of arrival time of <lb/>contrast medium and integrated signal <lb/>change of the voxel. Thresholds for the <lb/>arrival of contrast medium are measured <lb/>in units of SD of the precontrast signal <lb/>intensity. Physiologic and hardware-re-<lb/>lated fluctuations are thereby incorpo-<lb/>rated into the threshold on an examina-<lb/>tion-by-examination basis. The mean <lb/>precontrast signal intensity is calculated <lb/>from five image sets acquired before the <lb/>administration of contrast medium, and <lb/>the SD of the precontrast signal intensity <lb/>is calculated. The arrival time of the con-<lb/>trast medium is defined as the time at <lb/>which signal intensity first deviates from <lb/>the mean by 10 SDs. Voxels with arrival <lb/>times of more than 2 seconds later than <lb/>the first arrival times were rejected be-<lb/>cause they likely represented voxels with <lb/>predominantly venous circulation. The <lb/>automated AIF voxel was selected as the <lb/>time course in the remaining voxels that <lb/>exhibited the largest integrated change <lb/>in signal intensity. A time integration <lb/>window, roughly 8 seconds, containing <lb/>four consecutive images was used to re-<lb/>move transient noise spikes, as well as to <lb/>optimize the chosen AIF with respect to <lb/>relative CBV. <lb/>Image Processing <lb/>The resulting time-series of images <lb/>were postprocessed through deconvolu-<lb/>tion (6,7) of the AIF and indicator dilu-<lb/>tion techniques (10). To calculate hemo-<lb/>dynamic parameters (1-3), gadolinium <lb/>concentration as a function of time was <lb/>determined for each voxel, up to a scale <lb/>factor, on the basis of the relationship <lb/>determined with the following equation: <lb/>͓Gd͔͑t͒ ϭ Ϫ <lb/>K <lb/>TE <lb/>ln ͩ S͑t͒ <lb/>S 0 ͪ , (1) <lb/>where [Gd](t) is the contrast agent con-<lb/>centration of the voxel at time t; S(t) is <lb/>the signal intensity of the voxel at time, t, <lb/>S 0 is the precontrast signal intensity; and <lb/>K is a constant that reflects the contrast <lb/>agent relaxivity and pulse sequence pa-<lb/>rameters. The value of K was set to unity, <lb/>since it appears as a cofactor in both the <lb/>numerator and the denominator in the <lb/>calculation of CBV and therefore is irrel-<lb/>evant in the calculation. <lb/>A stack of two-dimensional images, <lb/>one image per section, in which signal <lb/>intensity was proportional to CBF (rela-<lb/>tive CBF) were produced automatically in <lb/>less than 1 minute. Additional images of <lb/>CBV (relative CBV) and MTT were pro-<lb/>duced (1-3). All image-processing soft-<lb/>ware used at MR imaging was written in <lb/>house and installed on the host console <lb/>computer of the imagers. The calculated <lb/>relative CBF, relative CBV, and MTT im-<lb/>ages were immediately reinserted into <lb/>the image database of the MR imaging <lb/>unit for near real-time display. <lb/>Comparison of AIFs <lb/>Detailed comparison and validation of <lb/>the automated AIF method compared <lb/>with the standard manual method was <lb/>undertaken in 20 of 100 cases in which a <lb/>suspected perfusion abnormality was <lb/>present. The 20 randomly selected pa-<lb/>tients included 10 male patients and 10 <lb/>female patients, with a mean age of 52.05 <lb/>years Ϯ 27.14 and an age range of 3-90 <lb/>years. Manual AIF selection was per-<lb/>formed by an operator trained in a previ-<lb/>ously reported method for choosing an <lb/>AIF (6,7,11). The operator iteratively placed <lb/>a region of interest in the location of the <lb/>proximal middle cerebral artery on ana-<lb/>tomic images (mean area ϭ 7.0 mm 2 Ϯ <lb/>5.4). The operator then viewed a cine loop <lb/>display of the time course of that voxel on <lb/>the dynamic T2*-weighted images to deter-<lb/>mine that it had signal loss characteristic of <lb/>an artery on the basis of arrival time, bolus <lb/>shape, and the magnitude of the signal <lb/>change. <lb/>Anatomic Registration of Automated <lb/>AIF <lb/>The anatomic location of the auto-<lb/>mated AIF was superimposed on the rel-<lb/>ative CBF images as small crosshairs. <lb/>These images were presented indepen-<lb/>dently to two board-certified neuroradi-<lb/>ologists (H.A.R., V.M.H.), who were in-<lb/>structed to identify the position of the <lb/>voxel relative to known vascular struc-<lb/>tures. Discrepant findings were resolved <lb/>with consensus. <lb/>Quantitative Comparison <lb/>Signal intensity versus time curves <lb/>were used to calculate ⌬R2*(t) for both <lb/>the automated AIF and the user-defined <lb/>AIF, with ⌬R2*(t) ϭ Ϫln[S(t)/S 0 ]/TE. The <lb/>⌬R2*(t) curves from both AIFs were fitted <lb/>to a gamma-variate function, that is, <lb/>C(t) ϭ at b e Ϫct , by using the Levenburg-<lb/>Marquart algorithm (12). The effects of <lb/>recirculation were removed by fitting <lb/>only the first pass of the bolus of contrast <lb/>agent. The fitted curves were compared <lb/>on the basis of three criteria that reflected <lb/>the partial-volume effects and the extent <lb/>with which the input function was con-<lb/>volved from the point of injection to the <lb/>point of measurement. The three criteria <lb/>were as follows: peak ⌬R2*, width of the <lb/>⌬R2* curve, and ratio of the integrated <lb/>⌬R2* curves. These are explained further <lb/>next. <lb/>One effect of the convolution is to <lb/>broaden the width of the AIF. In vivo, <lb/>when venous injections are performed, <lb/>the idealized bolus has undergone con-<lb/>volution in transit from the injection site <lb/>to the arteries in the brain. Further con-<lb/>volution of this bolus occurs as it passes <lb/>through the capillary bed. We compared <lb/>the full width half maximum (FWHM) of <lb/>the two AIFs to determine which AIF rep-<lb/>resented the least convolved and thus <lb/>represented a more pristine AIF. Previ-<lb/>ously, this criterion was used to choose <lb/>voxels as an AIF (8). <lb/>A greater concentration of gadolinium <lb/>at the peak of the bolus was assumed to <lb/>indicate less partial-volume averaging, <lb/></body>

			<body>because ⌬R2* and contrast agent concen-<lb/>tration are proportional. Therefore, we <lb/>compared the peak ⌬R2* and the inte-<lb/>grated ⌬R2* curves of the user-defined <lb/>and the automated AIF. With the inte-<lb/>grated ⌬R2* curves, we derived a measure <lb/>of the &quot;relative vascular volume&quot; of the <lb/>two AIFs by means of defining the user-<lb/>AIF as a reference and calculated the <lb/>CBV ratio as follows: <lb/>CBV ratio ϭ <lb/>͐ auto-AIF͑t͒dt <lb/>͐ user-AIF͑t͒dt <lb/>, <lb/>(2) <lb/>where auto-AIF(t) is the ⌬R2* per unit <lb/>time of the automated AIF and user-AIF(t) <lb/>is the ⌬R2* per unit time of the user-<lb/>defined AIF. The ratio exceeded 1 when <lb/>the vascular volume determined with the <lb/>automated AIF exceeded that determined <lb/>with the user-defined AIF. <lb/>Statistical Analysis <lb/>Statistical analysis was performed for <lb/>the FWHM, peak ⌬R2*, and CBV ratio of <lb/>the automated and the user-defined AIFs. <lb/>Significant differences were determined <lb/>on the basis of a Wilcoxon signed rank <lb/>test. Significant differences were defined <lb/>with a P value less than .05. We also <lb/>compared the integrate ⌬R2* and half <lb/>width of the raw unfit data. <lb/>Technical Validation in Patients <lb/>Blood flow maps of relative CBF, rela-<lb/>tive CBV, and MTT were prepared with <lb/>the automated method for each case and <lb/>were interpreted with the picture archiv-<lb/>ing and communication system together <lb/>with the anatomic images. In each case, <lb/>the quality of the images and the pres-<lb/>ence or absence of an abnormality were <lb/>assessed by a neuroradiologist. In each <lb/>case, conventional images were available <lb/>for interpretation or comparison in the <lb/>event that the automatically processed <lb/>images were considered technically inad-<lb/>equate. In all cases, commercially avail-<lb/>able software was also available to evalu-<lb/>ate time courses from selected regions of <lb/>interest to obtain additional perfusion <lb/>information. Images were classified as <lb/>technically inadequate if the relative <lb/>CBF, relative CBV, and MTT maps did not <lb/>have marked distinction between gray <lb/>and white matter, had inadequate defini-<lb/>tion of the brain contours, or had inade-<lb/>quate definition of a perfusion deficit <lb/>when one was shown to be present by <lb/>using any method. <lb/>Results <lb/>Technical Validation in Patients <lb/>Of 100 consecutive patients, 28 pa-<lb/>tients had perfusion abnormalities evi-<lb/>dent on the perfusion images and 72 had <lb/>none. Of the 28, five had increased per-<lb/>fusion indicative of increased blood vol-<lb/>ume in a tumor and 23 had perfusion <lb/>deficits indicative of ischemia or infarc-<lb/>tion. In these cases, hemodynamically <lb/>significant carotid arterial stenosis, ca-<lb/>rotid arterial occlusion, middle cerebral <lb/>arterial occlusion, posterior cerebral arte-<lb/>rial occlusion, or basilar arterial occlu-<lb/>sion was identified on the accompanying <lb/>MR angiographic images. One such ex-<lb/>ample is shown in Figure 1. In no case <lb/>were the perfusion images processed <lb/>from the automatically determined AIF <lb/>considered technically inadequate. <lb/>Anatomic Location of AIF Voxels <lb/>Of the 20 randomly selected patients, <lb/>19 had observable perfusion abnormali-<lb/>ties; abnormalities in seven of these 19 <lb/>patients were caused by vascular occlu-<lb/>sions. The location of the automated AIF <lb/>voxel was found to cover, or was located <lb/>immediately adjacent to, a major vessel <lb/>in each case: In 10 patients, the auto-<lb/>mated AIF voxel was located in the mid-<lb/>dle cerebral arterial branch in the sylvian <lb/>fissure; in six patients, in the anterior <lb/>cerebral artery in the interhemispheric <lb/>fissure; in two patients, in the posterior <lb/>cerebral artery within the deep calcarine <lb/>fissure; and in two patients, in the basilar <lb/>artery. In each case, the location sug-<lb/>gested the presence of a vessel that had a <lb/>predominantly inferosuperior course <lb/>within the voxel. A single section that <lb/>contained the voxel chosen as the AIF <lb/>from each of the examinations in 20 pa-<lb/>tients is shown in Figure 2. The locations <lb/>of the chosen voxels are shown as a small <lb/>cross in each section. <lb/>Quantitative Comparison: Automated <lb/>AIF versus User-defined AIF <lb/>In all 20 cases both the automated and <lb/>user-defined AIFs were successfully fit to a <lb/>gamma-variate function. Visual inspec-<lb/>tion of the ⌬R2* fit confirmed that the <lb/>automated AIF exhibited the characteris-<lb/>tic gamma-variate shape. The peak ⌬R2*, <lb/>the FWHM, and the CBV ratio for the two <lb/>AIFs are included in the Table. The mean <lb/>differences between the automated and <lb/>user-defined AIF were Ϫ0.16 sec Ϫ1 Ϯ 0.99 <lb/>and 14.87 sec Ϯ 20.66, respectively, for <lb/>the FWHM and peak ⌬R2* distributions. <lb/>The peak ⌬R2* was significantly higher <lb/>(P Ͻ .05) with the automated AIF (⌬R2* ϭ <lb/>46.35 sec Ϫ1 Ϯ 14.80) than it was with the <lb/>user-defined AIF (⌬R2* ϭ 31.48 sec Ϫ1 Ϯ <lb/>10.78). The CBV ratio significantly ex-<lb/>ceeded 1.0 (CBV ratio ϭ 1.97 Ϯ 2.53; P Ͻ <lb/>.05). The FWHM was smaller for the au-<lb/>tomated AIF (FWHM ϭ 2.47 sec Ϯ 0.68) <lb/>than it was for the user-defined AIF <lb/>(FWHM ϭ 2.63 sec Ϯ 1.01); however, <lb/>these differences were not statistically <lb/>significant (P ϭ .67). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Findings of this study indicate that <lb/>perfusion-weighted MR images can be <lb/>generated reliably with a program that <lb/>automatically identifies the AIF. Requir-<lb/>ing no operator input, this method al-<lb/>lows rapid, standardized calculation of <lb/>relative CBF without the need for off-line <lb/>image processing. The automated AIF <lb/>had a greater peak value and a smaller <lb/>width at half maximum, which suggests <lb/>less partial-volume averaging artifact <lb/>than that with the user-defined AIF. The <lb/>CBV ratio calculated on the basis of the <lb/>automated AIF is significantly greater <lb/>than that calculated with the user-de-<lb/>fined AIF. Since the program selects the <lb/>AIF on the basis of its time course rather <lb/>than on the basis of anatomic location, <lb/>operator selection bias is eliminated and <lb/>partial-volume averaging is minimized. <lb/>The automated AIF algorithm can be <lb/>used to eliminate off-line postprocessing <lb/>of dynamic susceptibility contrast MR <lb/>images and the need for specially trained <lb/>personnel. The automation of the deter-<lb/>mination of an AIF could potentially re-<lb/>move several steps in the processing of <lb/>dynamic susceptibility contrast MR im-<lb/>ages. Streamlining the generation of rel-<lb/>ative CBF images may prove beneficial <lb/>for time-critical applications, such as the <lb/>delineation of ischemic regions in pa-<lb/>tients who have acute stroke. Elimina-<lb/>tion of the complexity in image process-<lb/>ing could potentially result in broader <lb/>dissemination of the dynamic suscepti-<lb/>bility contrast MR imaging technology in <lb/>the radiology community. <lb/>In this pilot study of the reliability of <lb/>the automated AIF, perfusion images <lb/>were successfully produced with no addi-<lb/>tional off-line postprocessing and were <lb/>reviewed as part of the nominal patient <lb/>work-up. The automated AIF curves had a <lb/>more &quot;arterial&quot; shape than the user-de-<lb/>fined AIF curves, in the sense that they <lb/>were less broadened, as might occur as <lb/>the bolus of contrast material passes <lb/>through the vascular bed. Although AIFs <lb/></body>

			<body>calculated with the conventional method <lb/>are not considered a reference standard, <lb/>the conventional method represents a <lb/>reasonable check on the accuracy of the <lb/>automated method. The automated AIF <lb/>is a robust means of generating paramet-<lb/>ric images of relative CBF, relative CBV, <lb/>and MTT by using dynamic susceptibility <lb/>contrast MR imaging. It routinely pro-<lb/>vides technically adequate images in <lb/>clinical cases and, in particular, in those <lb/>characterized by severe cerebrovascular <lb/>disease. <lb/>One potential criticism of the auto-<lb/>mated AIF is that it selects one and only <lb/>one voxel that is used to deconvolve the <lb/>entire data set. Classic tracer kinetic mod-<lb/>eling assumes each capillary bed is sup-<lb/>plied by a unique and different input <lb/>function. Therefore, some groups have <lb/>suggested that individual AIFs should be <lb/>applied to normal and ischemic territo-<lb/>ries. However, in clinical practice, the <lb/>perfusion maps are used to identify areas <lb/>that deviate from normal. Use of the sin-<lb/>gle best internal &quot;control&quot; AIF, therefore, <lb/>could be viewed as a practical advantage <lb/>over the use of many individual AIFs, <lb/>which would actually reduce sensitivity <lb/>for low-flow lesions. <lb/>No failures due to patient motion were <lb/>identified in the pilot series, but the ef-<lb/>fect of patient motion on the reliability <lb/>of the program has not been evaluated. <lb/>The effect of congestive heart failure, ar-<lb/>teriovenous shunting, or other condi-<lb/>tions that might affect the automated <lb/>program were also not systematically <lb/>evaluated in this study. <lb/>The AIF selected by the automated pro-<lb/>gram appeared to localize on or immedi-<lb/>ately adjacent to a major artery. The pro-<lb/>gram selects the voxel on the basis of a <lb/>large signal intensity change. A voxel <lb/>containing an artery with an inferosupe-<lb/>rior orientation was most likely chosen <lb/>by the program, since such an anatomic <lb/>relationship minimizes partial-volume <lb/>averaging artifacts. Further processing of <lb/>this AIF by using iterative techniques <lb/>may be necessary for quantitative flow in <lb/>milliliters per 100 g per minute (13). The <lb/>program rejects veins because of the re-<lb/>quirement that voxels selected have the <lb/>earliest signal intensity changes. Venous <lb/>structures such as the sagittal sinus ap-<lb/>pear to be effectively removed from the <lb/>set of voxels considered as an AIF, and <lb/>such locations were never chosen for the <lb/>AIF in the cases analyzed. <lb/>The AIF program also effectively dis-<lb/>criminated signal intensity changes re-<lb/>lated to bolus passage from physiologic <lb/>Figure 1.

			<body>or imager noise unrelated to the passage <lb/>of the bolus of contrast agent. In all 20 <lb/>cases, a voxel with a characteristic gam-<lb/>ma-variate shape was identified, which <lb/>indicated that the chosen voxels were <lb/>not anomalous noise spikes or other spu-<lb/>rious signal changes. By using the pro-<lb/>posed method of determining AIF, the <lb/>potentially confounding effect of tran-<lb/>sient signal changes due to noise were <lb/>minimized with integration of the signal <lb/>intensity changes over several seconds. <lb/>Selection of the AIF on the basis of min-<lb/>imum width or peak signal change would <lb/>not likely have produced as reliable a re-<lb/>sult because of spurious brief fluctua-<lb/>tions. An additional benefit of the signal <lb/>integration is that it correlates well with <lb/>the determination of relative CBV (ie, <lb/>rCBV), which may be calculated as fol-<lb/>lows: <lb/>rCBV ϭ ͵ ͓Gd͔͑t͒dt/ ͵ AIF͑t͒dt. <lb/>In this respect, we have chosen a voxel <lb/>that has optimal relative CBV and there-<lb/>fore minimal partial-volume averaging. <lb/>The reduced partial-volume averaging is <lb/>evidenced by the fact that the automated <lb/>AIF has both the higher peak ⌬R2* and <lb/>the greater integrated contrast than the <lb/>user-AIF. These results indicate less par-<lb/>tial-volume averaging in the automated <lb/>AIF, which indicates a cleaner measure of <lb/>the true AIF and, hypothetically, a more <lb/>accurate determination of flow. <lb/>The use of the arrival time parameter <lb/>could potentially be modified and used <lb/>to identify the time courses of venous <lb/>efflux voxels. The identification of a ve-<lb/>nous time course has been shown to be <lb/>useful in correction of AIF for quantita-<lb/>tive determination of CBF (14). The use <lb/>of this approach to automated quantita-<lb/>tive CBF would present some advantages <lb/>relative to previously reported quantita-<lb/>tive CBF measures for which fewer sec-<lb/>tions were acquired and for which a ded-<lb/>icated imaging section was required to <lb/>interrogate the distal carotid artery (8). <lb/>Figure 1 (continued).

This is a limi-<lb/>tation that prevents an evaluation of ab-<lb/>solute CBF and the evaluation of the po-<lb/>tential improvements afforded by the <lb/>proposed venous efflux correction. <lb/>The automated AIF algorithm, as in the <lb/>case of the manual method, chooses a <lb/>single voxel or region of interest to rep-<lb/>resent the AIF for the whole brain. There <lb/>is some question as to whether the same <lb/>AIF is appropriate to deconvolve tissue <lb/>curves measured in a more proximal sec-<lb/>tion. On the basis of simulations, Oster-<lb/>gaard et al (5) concluded that singular <lb/>valued deconvolution underestimates <lb/>flow measured from tissue curves that <lb/>possess an arrival time delay relative to <lb/>the AIF. To validate this finding, Wire-<lb/>stam et al (7) compared AIFs recorded in <lb/>the carotid artery with an AIF manually <lb/>chosen in a proximal area of the imaging <lb/>section. They were unable to reproduce <lb/>the expectations of the simulations and <lb/>found no difference in absolute cerebral <lb/>perfusion when these two AIFs were com-<lb/>pared. It should also be noted that on the <lb/>basis of the original work of Ostergaard et <lb/>al (5), Fourier deconvolution of an AIF <lb/>will not exhibit the same sensitivity to <lb/>arrival time. In short, the arrival time <lb/>issue is one of the chosen deconvolution <lb/>techniques and not the manner in which <lb/>the AIF is chosen. <lb/>The automated method has limita-<lb/>tions. The algorithm depends on six pa-<lb/>rameters chosen for our specific imaging <lb/>protocol. The suitability of the algorithm <lb/>for other protocols in which fewer pre-<lb/>contrast points are obtained or smaller <lb/>amounts of contrast medium are used <lb/>has not been tested. However, with a <lb/>suitable choice of parameters, it is antic-<lb/>ipated that this algorithm can be suitably <lb/>adjusted to other acquisitions. For exam-<lb/>ple, in spin-echo acquisitions, the tran-<lb/>sient signal changes associated with bo-<lb/>lus passage are not as great as they are in <lb/>the gradient-echo acquisitions presented <lb/>in this work. Therefore, a different crite-<lb/>rion for determining the time of depar-<lb/>ture from baseline may be required with <lb/>spin-echo acquisitions. It should be <lb/>noted that we have successfully applied <lb/>the automated AIF with the current set of <lb/>parameters to spin-echo acquisitions in a <lb/>Figure 2. Cerebral blood flow images obtained in 20 randomly chosen patients (numbers in parentheses are patient numbers). The voxel that was <lb/>identified as the automated AIF was demarked with a small cross (ϩ) that was drawn by the postprocessing software to cover the chosen voxel. Two <lb/>neuroradiologists identified the vascular anatomy of the AIF voxel. In all cases, the AIF was identified with an arterial branch, such as the middle <lb/>cerebral artery, the anterior communicating artery, or the posterior communicating artery. Examples of these arteries are indicated with arrows. <lb/></body>

			<body>limited number of cases; however, a <lb/>study in a larger number of patients is <lb/>needed to establish its utility for these <lb/>acquisitions. Finally, a more direct opti-<lb/>mization of the relative CBV may be pos-<lb/>sible through the use of the ⌬R2* curve as <lb/>opposed to the raw signal changes. <lb/>In conclusion, we have evaluated an <lb/>automated rapid method of estimating <lb/>AIF for the calculation of relative CBF at <lb/>dynamic susceptibility contrast MR im-<lb/>aging. The automated AIF was found to <lb/>yield relative CBF parametric images of <lb/>diagnostic quality in 100 consecutive pa-<lb/>tients by using a standard MR imager and <lb/>single-dose gadolinium-based contrast <lb/>material. In a randomly chosen sample of <lb/>20 patients, the voxel that was chosen as <lb/>the AIF was found to be associated with <lb/>signal changes in the middle, posterior, <lb/>or anterior cerebral artery in or other ar-<lb/>terial structures. When compared with <lb/>the user-defined AIF, the automated AIF <lb/>was found to have significantly higher <lb/>peak ⌬R2* and similar bolus width as a <lb/>user-defined AIF. <lb/>APPENDIX <lb/>The automated AIF algorithm proposed <lb/>in this work interrogates the sample of all <lb/>voxels in the entire perfusion time-series to <lb/>identify the voxel that optimally represents <lb/>the AIF. The AIF voxel is optimized with <lb/>respect to integrated signal change, which <lb/>correlates with optimal blood volume. Vox-<lb/>els occupied by veins, and thus exhibit large <lb/>CBV, are rejected with determination of <lb/>their arrival time relative to other voxels. <lb/>The automated AIF algorithm determines <lb/>bolus arrival times on the basis of adaptive <lb/>thresholds: thresholds for the arrival of con-<lb/>trast material and signal enhancement are <lb/>measured in units of the SD of the precon-<lb/>trast signal. In this way, signal fluctuations <lb/>from both physiologic and hardware noise <lb/>that vary from image to image and patient <lb/>to patient are implicitly included in the al-<lb/>gorithm. Our algorithm can be delineated <lb/>in five steps: (a) determine precontrast time <lb/>frames, (b) calculate the contrast material <lb/>arrival time of each voxel, (c) remove ve-<lb/>nous voxels on the basis of late contrast <lb/>material arrival time, (d) find the arterial <lb/>voxel with the highest peak signal change <lb/>associated with bolus passage, and (e) deter-<lb/>mine the time limits of the bolus passage for <lb/>the AIF deconvolution. These are described <lb/>next. <lb/>The precontrast time frames that are used <lb/>for baseline signal and noise calculations <lb/>are determined with the whole-brain signal <lb/>intensity as a function of time. By using <lb/>these average signal intensities, we estimate <lb/>the mean precontrast signal and the SD by <lb/>using frames acquired from 10 to 20 sec-<lb/>onds after initiation of imaging. The 10 -20-<lb/>second time window is appropriate because <lb/>our imaging protocol requires intravenous <lb/>injection of contrast material 13 seconds <lb/>after initiation of imaging to ensure con-<lb/>trast-free time frames for the determination <lb/>of baseline signal intensity. The SD was <lb/>used to determine an upper limit for signal <lb/>fluctuation to determine precontrast frames <lb/>(Ͻ3) and a threshold for contrast material <lb/>arrival (Ͼ10), as shown in Figure A1. <lb/>By using the precontrast frames deter-<lb/>mined from the analysis of the whole brain, <lb/>the mean precontrast signal intensity, or S 0 <lb/>of each individual voxel located at position <lb/>Comparison of Automated AIF and User-defined AIF on the Basis of ⌬R2*, <lb/>FWHM, and CBV ratio in 20 Patients <lb/>Subject <lb/>Peak ⌬R2* (sec Ϫ1 ) <lb/>FWHM (sec) <lb/>CBV ratio <lb/>Automated AIF <lb/>User-defined AIF <lb/>Automated AIF <lb/>User-defined AIF <lb/>1 <lb/>46.56 <lb/>36.27 <lb/>2.08 <lb/>2.40 <lb/>1.10 <lb/>2 <lb/>93.68 <lb/>15.47 <lb/>2.20 <lb/>2.50 <lb/>12.56 <lb/>3 <lb/>41.28 <lb/>30.89 <lb/>1.80 <lb/>3.64 <lb/>0.64 <lb/>4 <lb/>43.20 <lb/>27.43 <lb/>2.52 <lb/>2.96 <lb/>1.29 <lb/>5 <lb/>42.26 <lb/>41.10 <lb/>3.92 <lb/>3.28 <lb/>1.26 <lb/>6 <lb/>70.28 <lb/>37.11 <lb/>2.00 <lb/>2.88 <lb/>1.30 <lb/>7 <lb/>26.25 <lb/>30.21 <lb/>2.04 <lb/>2.56 <lb/>0.68 <lb/>8 <lb/>49.44 <lb/>32.69 <lb/>2.56 <lb/>1.96 <lb/>1.96 <lb/>9 <lb/>59.63 <lb/>16.29 <lb/>2.28 <lb/>5.24 <lb/>1.52 <lb/>10 <lb/>51.52 <lb/>35.10 <lb/>2.96 <lb/>3.24 <lb/>1.28 <lb/>11 <lb/>36.95 <lb/>44.42 <lb/>1.52 <lb/>0.96 <lb/>1.30 <lb/>12 <lb/>48.24 <lb/>17.89 <lb/>2.12 <lb/>2.24 <lb/>2.55 <lb/>13 <lb/>45.18 <lb/>42.24 <lb/>1.88 <lb/>1.56 <lb/>1.28 <lb/>14 <lb/>29.81 <lb/>21.15 <lb/>2.68 <lb/>2.20 <lb/>1.67 <lb/>15 <lb/>40.98 <lb/>28.16 <lb/>4.00 <lb/>4.36 <lb/>1.28 <lb/>16 <lb/>35.28 <lb/>28.13 <lb/>2.12 <lb/>1.92 <lb/>1.34 <lb/>17 <lb/>35.68 <lb/>39.90 <lb/>3.00 <lb/>1.32 <lb/>2.05 <lb/>18 <lb/>42.10 <lb/>57.89 <lb/>3.40 <lb/>2.72 <lb/>0.92 <lb/>19 <lb/>41.07 <lb/>18.58 <lb/>2.00 <lb/>2.72 <lb/>1.63 <lb/>20 <lb/>47.58 <lb/>28.73 <lb/>2.28 <lb/>2.00 <lb/>1.89 <lb/>Mean <lb/>46.35 <lb/>31.48 <lb/>2.47 <lb/>2.63 <lb/>1.98 <lb/>SD <lb/>14.80 <lb/>10.78 <lb/>0.68 <lb/>1.01 <lb/>2.53 <lb/>Note.-The mean difference, SD, and P value for automated AIF at peak ⌬R2* were 14.87, 20.66, <lb/>and less than .05, respectively, and at FWHM, they were Ϫ0.16, 0.99, and .67 (not significant), <lb/>respectively.

			<body>x,y,z and the SD, or (x,y,z), of each individ-<lb/>ual voxel were calculated and used to deter-<lb/>mine contrast material arrival time of each <lb/>voxel. Since the changes of whole-brain sig-<lb/>nal versus time were dominated by signal in <lb/>the large blood vessels, we calculated a sep-<lb/>arate arrival time threshold to determine <lb/>voxel-by-voxel arrival time. The contrast <lb/>material arrival time in each voxel is the <lb/>first time point with a signal depletion of <lb/>greater than 5 ⅐ (x,y,z). This arrival time <lb/>was used to identify any voxels with de-<lb/>layed arrival times. If the arrival time of a <lb/>voxel was more than 2 seconds after the <lb/>whole-brain arrival time, it was assumed to <lb/>reflect flow in large venous structures and, <lb/>therefore, was removed from further con-<lb/>sideration as the AIF voxel. <lb/>The AIF is defined as the voxel, of the <lb/>remaining voxels, that exhibits the largest <lb/>change in signal intensity sustained over <lb/>four time frames, or roughly 8 seconds, in <lb/>the current imaging protocol (Fig A1). The <lb/>AIF was then used to determine the arrival <lb/>of the contrast material and the recircula-<lb/>tion peak of the bolus. This is accomplished <lb/>with identification of the first time point <lb/>after peak signal where the derivative of the <lb/>AIF decreased to less than zero. The arrival <lb/>time and recirculation points were used to <lb/>determine the time limits for gamma-vari-<lb/>ate fits and the deconvolution of tissue con-<lb/>centration curves. <lb/></body>
