			<body>Introduction <lb/>Red blood cell (RBC) immunization is one of the most frequent side effects of blood transfu-<lb/>sion. Up to 8% of RBC recipients may develop new antibodies after a single transfusion epi-<lb/>sode [1]. Patients that develop alloantibodies are also at risk to develop autoimmunization <lb/>against RBC antigens. In fact, alloimmunization is the most frequent cause for autoimmuniza-<lb/>tion [2]. As about half to two third of the alloantibodies become undetectable within four to <lb/>five years [3-5], the affected patients are at risk of developing delayed serologic or hemolytic <lb/>transfusion reactions after subsequent blood transfusions. Therefore, RBC antibodies are <lb/>among the most common causes of transfusion morbidity [6, 7]. RBC antibodies were also the <lb/>most frequent transfusion cause of death accounting for 10 out of 25 cases in a recent report of <lb/>the European Commission [8]. Sensitive detection of these antibodies is essential. <lb/>Several techniques have been developed for this purpose. Low Ionic Strength Solution <lb/>(LISS)-Antihuman Globulin, polyethylene glycol and polybrene have been introduced as reac-<lb/>tion enhancers, and antigen-antibody reactions were transferred from tube to column aggluti-<lb/>nation or microplate solid-phase reactions. Among these, antihuman globulin non-tube tests <lb/>have been found to be superior to the others [9]. Solid-phase reactions on microtiter plates <lb/>[10] are known to be sensitive but lack sufficient specificity: They produce inconclusive results <lb/>2.5 to 10 times more frequently than column systems [11, 12]. Column agglutination may be <lb/>performed using cards that either trap agglutinates in a dextran-acrylamide matrix, or in a <lb/>matrix consisting of glass beads [13-15]. These similar methods have been investigated with <lb/>stored samples, blood donors or in house reagent cells. Data on the performance in patient <lb/>diagnostics is incomplete. <lb/>Therefore, we compared gel with glass bead based column agglutination technologies. Our <lb/>results indicate that both systems have equal sensitivity and specificity in screening. However, <lb/>we observed differences in identification related to the setup of the panels. <lb/>Material and methods <lb/>Reagents <lb/>RBC antibody screening and identification tests from Bio-Rad DiaMed (Cressier-sur-Morat, <lb/>Switzerland; gel card) [13] and Ortho Clinical Diagnostics (Raritan, New Jersey, USA; glass <lb/>card) [14] were used according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Reaction strength was <lb/>graded on a scale of zero (negative) to four-plus (complete agglutination). Screening was per-<lb/>formed using a panel of three reagent cells in antihuman globulin without enzyme-treated <lb/>cells (ID-DIA Panel I-II-III test cells, Surgiscreen test cells), which homozygously expressed <lb/>the antigens D, c, Fy a , Fy b , Jk a , Jk b , S, and s as well as C, E, e, C W , K, k, Kp a , Kp b , Le a , Le b , M, <lb/>N, Lu a , Lu b , and P 1 . Antibody identification with both systems was performed using untreated <lb/>and either papain-treated (DiaMed) or ficin-treated (Ortho) reagent cells (ID-Dia Panel or <lb/>Resolve Panel C). Untreated reagent cells were tested in antihuman globulin (LISS/Coombs <lb/>gel cards, BioVue System Poly Cassettes), and enzyme-treated cells in a saline milieu (neutral <lb/>gel card, BioVue neutral cassettes). Gel card samples were pipetted manually, and glass card <lb/>samples were pipetted using an automated platform (AutoVue Innova). Reactions were classi-<lb/>fied as specifically positive if at least homozygous cells were weakly reactive (+/-). <lb/>Patients and samples <lb/>Two groups of samples were investigated as approved by the local ethics committee (Indepen-<lb/>dent Ethics Committee at the University of Regensburg, 17-537-101). Group A consisted of <lb/>1000 unstored local routine EDTA-anticoagulated samples that were recruited from local <lb/></body>

			<body>patients of the University Hospital Regensburg with a case mix index of 2.0 and 835 beds that <lb/>are mainly focused on intensive care with approximately 28,000 antibody screens and 18,000 <lb/>red cell transfusions annually. These were screened for antibodies prospectively and in parallel <lb/>(by both test systems) from the end of March to the end of April 2017. If a sample tested posi-<lb/>tive by one or both methods, antibody identification was performed by both systems. <lb/>Group B consisted of 202 sera with known antibodies that were mainly collected locally as <lb/>well as from cooperating blood banks. Antibody identification of these samples was performed <lb/>retrospectively and in parallel from the end of March to the middle of August 2017. RBC <lb/>screening was not performed in group B. <lb/>Results <lb/>Prospective antibody screening was performed in a total of 1000 samples in group A (Table 1) <lb/>using both gel cards and glass bead cards. Irregular antibodies were detected in a total of 22 <lb/>samples (2.2%) from 17 group A patients (2.5%), seven samples of which had more than one <lb/>antibody (32%). <lb/>Both test systems yielded true positive results for 17 samples containing mostly clinically <lb/>relevant antibodies (Table 2). A further 3 samples only tested positive by gel card (including <lb/>one false positive), whereas additional 4 samples were only positive by glass card (also includ-<lb/>ing one false positive, Table 3 and Table 4). Samples were regarded as false positive if positive <lb/>screening could not be confirmed by differentiation (ie. sporadic reaction without determin-<lb/>able antigen specificity). Altogether, reaction discrepancies were observed in 7 of 24 samples <lb/>(29%), all of which had weak reactions graded one-plus or lower (Table 4). This included one <lb/>sample with a true positive glass card reaction and a false negative gel card reaction: antibody <lb/>differentiation was possible in the case of the gel card system but not the glass card system.

			<body>group A, the difference between the two systems was not significant (in McNemar&apos;s test, the p-<lb/>value was 1). <lb/>Group B samples consisted of 202 known positive samples from 180 patients with a total of <lb/>327 antibodies. 82 (41%) of these samples contained more than one antibody (including auto-<lb/>antibodies). As group B included only those sera that were reactive upon retesting, sensitivity, <lb/>specificity, and accuracy could not be determined for that group. In fact, a further 10 samples <lb/>were non-reactive after storage at -30˚C for up to 5 years and therefore not included. <lb/>Both systems were positive for 158 of the 202 antibody-containing group B samples, includ-<lb/>ing two samples with incomplete test results with both systems (Table 4). Altogether, gel card <lb/>testing produced false negative results for 11 samples, and glass card testing yielded false nega-<lb/>tive results for 35 samples. <lb/>There were discrepancies between results for certain blood groups. In group B samples, <lb/>antibodies to Rh antigens appeared to be more reactive in the gel card system. Of the 53 group <lb/>B sera containing anti-C, 40 were reactive in glass card testing compared to 52 in gel card test-<lb/>ing. Of a total of 123 samples containing antibodies against Rh antigens, 106 were detected by <lb/>the glass card system compared to 122 by the gel card system. Warm-reactive autoantibodies <lb/>(WAA), which usually display some Rh reactivity, were detected in 18 of 24 samples (glass <lb/>card) versus 22 of 24 samples (gel card). This difference indicates that reagent cells were more <lb/>intensely treated by the gel card system&apos;s enzyme (papain) than by that of the glass card system <lb/>(ficin) and, thus, were more reactive to antibodies to the Rh system. <lb/>Autoantibodies were present in 26 samples: 18 were detected by both systems; six by gel <lb/>card only; and two by glass card only. This finding is consistent with the more intense enzyme <lb/>treatment of reagent cells associated with the gel card system. <lb/>No difference between systems was observed for antibodies to Jk antigens. A total of 13 <lb/>group B sera contained anti-Jk a : nine were detected by both systems, two by gel card testing <lb/>only, and another two by glass card testing only. <lb/>Antibodies to the Kell system were present in 22 group B samples: The glass card system <lb/>detected all twenty-two while the gel card system detected twenty. <lb/>In group B, 44 of 202 samples (22%) gave discrepant results using the two assays (Table 4) <lb/>and this difference was significant (p &lt; 0.005 in McNemar&apos;s test). This included seven samples <lb/>containing anti-Lu a , which was not detected or was incompletely recognized in glass card <lb/>Table 3.

			<body>regarded as a common phenomenon, occurring in 1% to 10% of adult transfusion recipients <lb/>[18, 19]. <lb/>In this comparative study of two commercially available red blood cell antibody screen-<lb/>ing systems, the glass card method was found to be comparable to the gel card system in <lb/>prospective antibody screening (group A, sensitivities of 90.9% vs. 86.4%, respectively. This <lb/>confirms roughly the results of a recent Spanish study, which found sensitivities of 87.5% to <lb/>100% with samples that were stored up to 72 h at 2-8˚C. The reported numbers in that <lb/>study were higher after the authors included a different group of known positive samples <lb/>[20]. The primary screening samples group had a low rate of non-negative tests of 0.9%, <lb/>because 80% of the samples were from healthy blood donors. This impairs the applicability <lb/>of the results to patient diagnostics, as not only less, but also different antibodies occur in <lb/>healthy donors. <lb/>In a recent prospective study in Thailand, sensitivities of 100% and 85.7% were found for <lb/>the glass card and gel card system, respectively, for antibodies regarded as significant [21]. Sen-<lb/>sitivities for clinically insignificant antibodies were lower: only 53.6% for the glass card and <lb/>28.5%-35.7% for two different gel card systems, respectively. However, the Thai researchers <lb/>also regarded antibodies to Mi a , Le a , and M, which may cause hemolysis in some cases, as <lb/>insignificant. These antibodies were found in tube testing, which is otherwise known to be sig-<lb/>nificantly less sensitive [11, 22]. These authors used reagent cells from the Thai Red Cross Soci-<lb/>ety for all methods. If the same low ionic strength buffer was used for all methods, this could <lb/>have impaired methods that depend on the buffer&apos;s composition [23]. <lb/>Weisbach et al. [11] found that the glass card and gel card systems have sensitivities of <lb/>90.5% and 93.5%, respectively, but they used stored samples for their analysis (comparable to <lb/>our group B). In our group B, the gel card system was superior to the glass card system for ana-<lb/>lyzing stored samples with known antibodies. Accordingly, we calculated the positive predic-<lb/>tive value (PPV) of the gel card and glass card system to be 95% and 82%, respectively. This <lb/>difference is plausible as testing included antibodies that were only reactive with enzyme-<lb/>treated cells and enzyme-treatment is more intense for gel card testing. However, the clinical <lb/>significance of enzyme-only antibodies is unclear. Antibody screening is generally performed <lb/>without enzyme-treated cells because the delay required to obtain additional information (e.g., <lb/>on weak warm-reactive autoantibodies, which are clinically irrelevant) results in a disadvan-<lb/>tage that exceeds the potential benefit [24]. In addition, the potential harm of enzyme-only <lb/>antibodies has long been a matter of debate [25, 26]. <lb/>Solid-phase testing is established without enzyme-treated cells and has been found to <lb/>achieve superior sensitivities [11, 27]. This includes testing for prenatal anti-D, which could be <lb/>detected up to the fifth dilution step in solid-phase testing, while card testing was generally <lb/>only positive up to the fourth dilution step [28]. The solid-phase system&apos;s superior sensitivity <lb/>contrasts with its low specificity [12]. Weisbach et al. found inconclusive reactivities, possibly <lb/>mostly false positive reactions, in 1.38% and 0.13% of samples tested with a solid-phase and gel <lb/>card system, respectively [11]. Inconsistent results were also found by Quillen et al., who <lb/>reported for automated solid-phase systems non-repeatability for the detection of antibodies <lb/>to E, Jk a , and Fy a [29]. A recent comparison found unspecified reactions in 7 cases for the solid <lb/>phase assay compared to 2 for gel card agglutination [12]. <lb/>In general, studies without sample storage that reflect real world testing were based on a <lb/>small number of positive samples, which is of questionable significance. The use of stored sam-<lb/>ples, in contrast, allows investigators to analyze a larger number of samples. Antibodies are <lb/>usually considered robust to pre-analytical variation. If, for instance, antibodies to Toxoplasma <lb/>are stored at -20˚C, there occurs an approximately 8% decrease in IgG antibodies and a 13% <lb/>decrease in IgM antibodies, both of which are less than analytical variation [30]. However, <lb/></body>

			<body>compared to antibodies to red cell antigens, antibodies to various viral antigens are more stable <lb/>in vivo, with half-lives ranging from 50 to 200 years [31]. In contrast, antibodies to red cells <lb/>have much shorter half-lives of less than 4 years overall [3, 4], and the half-live is dependent <lb/>from the specificity [3-5]. There are no robust data on red cell antibody decay during storage, <lb/>but it is likely that storage also affects antibodies differently. As all methods have antibodies <lb/>that react especially well with the respective method, this bearing damage would effect the per-<lb/>formance with stored samples. This effect was apparent with our data. It limits the interpreta-<lb/>tion of results and the use of statistical data from stored samples. <lb/>Batch-to-batch variation of reagent cells was detected as an incidental finding of our study. <lb/>These fluctuations impacted the test sensitivity for Lu a <lb/>, a less frequent antigen. The corre-<lb/>sponding antibody was weakly reactive in many of the stored samples and was only visible in <lb/>some of the Lu a -positive cells. Batch-to-batch variation of reagent cells is possible, as reagent <lb/>cell donors have different antigen expression levels. Cell storage and preparation methods may <lb/>also impact reactivity. Therefore, decreased sensitivity with differentiation panels that contain <lb/>only one instead of two antigen-positive cells is plausible. One group recently published similar <lb/>findings for Kp a , which increases the sensitivity of the test system if included in screening at <lb/>the cost of having four instead of three cells per sample in the screening [12]. <lb/>In conclusion, RBC antibody screening sensitivity is important to detect antibodies in eva-<lb/>nescence. This favors the use of enzyme-treated cells and to include all important antigens, if <lb/>blood provision was thereby not impaired. <lb/></body>
