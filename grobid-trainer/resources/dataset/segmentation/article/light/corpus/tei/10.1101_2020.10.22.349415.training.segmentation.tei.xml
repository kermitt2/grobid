We complement transcriptomic data with <lb/>immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex <lb/>parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This <lb/>arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and <lb/>choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain.

Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons-evolutionarily expanded in <lb/>humans 4 -show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic <lb/>vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission.

			<body>caused over a million deaths worldwide (worldometers.info/coronavirus). Though SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that COVID-19 patients <lb/>can suffer neurological and psychiatric symptoms of varied severity, depending on SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>mechanisms as well as other variables, such as co-morbidities and clinical care 1-3,5 . Central <lb/>nervous system (CNS) symptoms range from loss of smell and headache to memory loss, <lb/>encephalitis, stroke, difficulty concentrating, and persistent fatigue 1,6-8 . Symptoms are especially <lb/>frequent and prominent in the over 20% of COVID-19 patients that require hospitalization 1,9-11 . <lb/>With lingering CNS symptoms documented in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and <lb/>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) survivors 1,12-14 , it remains to be seen whether such <lb/>chronic symptoms will emerge in COVID-19 survivors. <lb/>Cellular and molecular approaches are required to understand the neurological changes <lb/>that may contribute to symptoms reported in COVID-19 patients. Fundamentally, pathology can <lb/>arise from the direct infection of neurons and glia or indirectly from peripheral infection and its <lb/>attendant immune response 15,16 . Viral RNA has been detected in the olfactory mucosa and <lb/>cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in some cases, but the consequences for brain cells remain unclear 17-<lb/>20 . Several reports using elegant in vitro culture systems, such as neuronal organoids, have <lb/>reached conflicting conclusions regarding the potential for SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion 21-26 . The <lb/>physiological relevance of such cultured systems, from the viral titers applied to their fidelity to <lb/>actual patient brains, also remains unclear 23,27,28 . Missing so far is an unbiased view of the <lb/>molecular and cellular perturbations across brain cell types in COVID-19 patients. This is in part <lb/>because high-quality human brain tissue from patients for such studies is largely <lb/>inaccessible 21,23,24 . Furthermore, several brain regions highly relevant to COVID-19, such as the <lb/>choroid plexus 23,24 , have not yet been successfully profiled in humans at single-cell resolution, in <lb/>health or disease 29 . <lb/>Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal <lb/>cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient (Fig. 1a). <lb/>We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of <lb/>SARS-CoV-2. These data-which includes the first, to our knowledge, single-cell view of <lb/>neurological changes in COVID-19 and of the human choroid plexus in general-provide a <lb/>molecular framework for how SARS-CoV-2 affects the brain without requiring direct <lb/>neuroinvasion; reveals the major pathways and cell types perturbed; and highlights associations <lb/>with chronic CNS diseases potentially pertinent to COVID-19 survivors.

			<body>be updated as more patient samples become available, to provide a resource for researchers to <lb/>further dissect the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2&apos;s impacts on the brain. <lb/>Cell type-specific gene expression changes in the COVID-19 brain <lb/>We aimed to gain insight into the cell type-specific transcriptomic effects of COVID-19 <lb/>on the brain by performing unbiased single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of 15 fresh-<lb/>frozen postmortem medial frontal cortex and lateral ventricle choroid plexus samples from 10 <lb/>non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient of similar clinical course as the COVID-19 <lb/>patients (Extended Data Table 1). Our sample sizes were similar to those reported in previous <lb/>snRNA-seq studies 30-32 . Samples in the control and COVID-19 groups were between 58 and 91 <lb/>years old and matched for tissue dissection area and RNA quality (Extended Data Fig. 1, <lb/>Extended Data Table 1). Cause of death for COVID-19 and influenza patients was consistently <lb/>interstitial pneumonia after more than two weeks of mechanical ventilation. Two COVID-19 <lb/>patients experienced objective neurological symptoms during care (Extended Data Table 1). <lb/>Samples were not confounded by technical or batch artifacts (Extended Data Fig. 2). <lb/>To begin, we generated 23,626 single-nuclei gene expression profiles from the medial <lb/>frontal cortex (4 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, 1 influenza)-and detected a median of 1,486 genes <lb/>per nucleus, a yield that is in line with recent snRNA-seq studies (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. <lb/>1) 31-34 . We performed unbiased clustering of nuclear profiles to identify and annotate 8 cell <lb/>types, including subtypes of excitatory neurons and interneurons. Each annotated cell type <lb/>expressed previously established marker genes (Extended Data Fig. 3): excitatory neurons <lb/>(e.g., marked by CBLN2 and NRGN), inhibitory neurons (GAD1), astrocytes (AQP4), <lb/>oligodendrocytes (MBP and ST18), microglia (DOCK8), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells <lb/>(VCAN), maturing neurons (DACH1), and endothelial cells (LEPR)-though this latter <lb/>population also contains mixed markers for vascular mural pericytes and smooth muscle cells, <lb/>as in prior reports 32,34,35 . Overall, the cell type identities, markers, and proportions match prior <lb/>snRNA-seq data from adult human cortex (Extended data Fig. 1-4, Extended Data Table 2) 31-34 . <lb/>We compared levels of gene expression in cells isolated from COVID-19 versus non-<lb/>viral control individuals by cell type and identified 2,194 unique differentially expressed genes <lb/>(DEGs) that implicated all major cell types (Extended Data Table 3). As recently reported in <lb/>Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) 34 , neurons exhibited a strong signature of repression-73% of DEGs <lb/>in excitatory neurons and 65% in interneurons were downregulated-whereas DEGs in glial <lb/>oligodendrocytes, OPCs, astrocytes, and microglia were more balanced (36-51%, Fig. 1c-d). <lb/>The number of DEGs was greatest for astrocytes, excitatory neurons, and oligodendrocytes, <lb/></body>

			<body>partially reflecting increased power in these higher-abundance cell types. The vast majority of <lb/>DEGs were perturbed in only a single cell type (~84%, Fig. 1e-f, Extended Data Fig. 5a), further <lb/>indicating a cell type-specific CNS response to COVID-19. However, the minority of shared <lb/>DEGs clustered into meaningful pathways: for example, commonly downregulated DEGs <lb/>implicated impairments in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) <lb/>signaling (Fig. 1f), both critical for homeostatic neuronal function 36-40 . Overall, these results <lb/>indicate that all major brain parenchymal cell types are affected at the transcriptional level by <lb/>COVID-19, and that single-cell-level resolution is critical because changes in gene expression-<lb/>including directionality-are dependent on cell type. <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 accumulation in barrier cells stimulates inflammatory signaling to the brain <lb/>The observed transcriptional response to COVID-19 in the brain could arise from direct <lb/>neurotropism or indirect damage via peripheral inflammation 15,16 . We thus stained for the SARS-<lb/>CoV-2 spike glycoprotein 20,41 in medial frontal cortex and choroid plexus tissue immediately <lb/>adjacent to tissue used in snRNA-seq. Intriguingly, we detected spike glycoprotein robustly in <lb/>two COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2). Upon closer examination however, spike glycoprotein signal <lb/>resided only within the barrier-forming cortical vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus. <lb/>Within the choroid plexus, signal appeared within the stromal compartment, though confident <lb/>cell type assignment was not possible (Fig. 2c). Thus, unlike recent reports where SARS-CoV-2 <lb/>was added directly to neuroglial organoids lacking brain-barrier cells 21-25 , we do not observe <lb/>significant virus invasion in cortex parenchymal cells. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection <lb/>of the CSF-barrier forming choroid plexus and meninges corroborates recent in vitro, in silico, <lb/>CSF, and postmortem case studies suggesting CNS barrier cells can support productive <lb/>infection at relatively low titers 5,23,24,42,43 . We note however that this absence of detectable <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion does not exclude its possibility. Likewise, it is possible that the <lb/>other two COVID-19 patients sustain SARS-CoV-2 barrier cell infection undetected in the tissue <lb/>sampled. Corroborating a recent study 5 , presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS did not correlate <lb/>with neurological symptoms (Extended Data Table 1). Together, these results suggest that <lb/>brain-barrier cells may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that preferential <lb/>accumulation of virus in the barriers may give rise to widespread cortical DEGs. <lb/>Because we detected SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in the blood-brain and blood-<lb/>CSF-barrier cells, we sought to devise methods to profile these cells and better understand their <lb/>relation to cortical transcriptional perturbations with COVID-19. However, conventional brain <lb/>snRNA-seq preparation methods nearly universally deplete high-quality brain vascular nuclei <lb/></body>

			<body>from endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts for currently unknown <lb/>reasons 32-35 . At the same time, no snRNA-seq study exists on the human choroid plexus, in <lb/>health or disease. This could, as we discovered, be because enzymatic and dounce <lb/>homogenization techniques successfully used to process mouse tissue 29 resulted in a near <lb/>complete loss of genes in isolated human choroid nuclei. We thus generated a method involving <lb/>successive gentle triturations in mild detergent (Methods), yielding 24,052 nuclei across 7 major <lb/>epithelial, mesenchymal, immune, and glial cell types (6 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, 1 influenza; Fig. <lb/>3a, Extended Data Fig. 4, Extended Data Table 4). <lb/>Epithelial cells accounted for 81% of choroid nuclei profiled, and interestingly, <lb/>subclustered based on expression of the receptor (PRLR) for prolactin-a hormone mediating <lb/>neurogenesis 44,45 -, the glutathione peroxidase GPX3-which protects the CSF from <lb/>hydroperoxides 46 -, and the chloride anion exchanger SLC26A3-which may maintain <lb/>physiologic ion concentrations in the CSF 47 . Similar to brain vascular cells 16,48 , the choroid <lb/>barrier and stromal epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and ependymal cells robustly <lb/>expressed the antiviral defense gene IFITM3. Intriguingly, we observed a broad upregulation of <lb/>IFITM3 across barrier cells in COVID-19 patients, consistent with immunohistochemical <lb/>detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3b). IFITM3 serves as the first line of defense against <lb/>viral infection 49 and its upregulation is a marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection across publicly <lb/>available datasets 50 . We also observed in the cortex parenchyma a consistent upregulation of <lb/>the newly described viral entry receptor NRP1 41,51,52 (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 6), which has <lb/>been previously found upregulated in inflamed COVID-19 lung tissue 51,53 . <lb/>Overall, the DEGs detected in choroid epithelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and <lb/>monocytes indicate strong CNS inflammation in COVID-19 (Fig. 3c-e, Extended Data Table 5). <lb/>For example, we observed upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which has been <lb/>reported sufficient to induce pathologic microglial and astrocyte activation 54,55 . The coincident <lb/>upregulation of IL-1β, CCL2, and CCL4 further suggests a weakened choroid barrier and an <lb/>increasingly permissive environment for immune cell transmigration into the brain <lb/>parenchyma 56-58 . The aged choroid plexus has recently been reported to send inflammatory <lb/>signals to the brain, thereby activating glia and impairing cognitive function 59,60 . To assess if <lb/>similar pro-inflammatory signaling mechanisms occur in COVID-19, we performed cell-cell <lb/>communication analysis 61,62 . We observed a strong increase in choroid-to-cortex signaling <lb/>across key inflammatory pathways, such as the CCL and CXCL family of chemokines (Fig. 3f, <lb/>Extended Data Fig. 5b). Together, these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect and <lb/></body>

			<body>inflame brain-barrier cells, including the choroid plexus; and that this barrier-together with <lb/>peripheral-inflammation is then relayed into the brain parenchyma. <lb/>Immune cell infiltration and activation of neuronal engulfment programs in microglia <lb/>We sought to evaluate the predicted activation of brain microglia and migration of <lb/>peripheral immune cells via enhanced inflammatory signaling from the periphery and brain-<lb/>barrier cells. Intriguingly, we observed in the cortex a COVID-19 enriched subpopulation of <lb/>microglia (Fig. 4a-b, Extended Data Fig. 7-8). This cluster was marked by expression of genes <lb/>implicated in human microglial activation, such as CD74, FTL, and FTH1 (Extended Data Table <lb/>6). These very genes have recently been described as difficult to detect by snRNA-seq 63 , further <lb/>underscoring strong COVID-19 microglial activation. An over-represented fraction of COVID-19 <lb/>microglia cluster marker genes overlap (P &lt; 10 -25 , hypergeometric test) with human Alzheimer&apos;s <lb/>disease microglia cluster markers 34 (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Monocle trajectory analysis 64 found <lb/>that the COVID-19 microglia cluster emerged from the parent homeostatic population-and that <lb/>the expression of activation markers increased along the pseudotime route-, suggesting that <lb/>these microglia emerged in response to an increasingly inflamed CNS environment (Fig. 4c, <lb/>Extended Data Fig. 7a-b), consistent with enhanced brain-barrier inflammatory signaling. Our <lb/>observations suggest that the COVID-19 subpopulation represents a distinct microglial state <lb/>that shares features with, but is ultimately different from, microglial cell states previously <lb/>reported in human neurodegenerative disease. <lb/>We next assessed the predicted increase in peripheral immune cell infiltration. We <lb/>indeed found both an increase in T-cells (marked by CD247 encoding the TCR CD3-zeta <lb/>protein, Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 8e) and an increase in peripheral macrophages (marked by <lb/>F13A1 65,66 , Fig. 4e). Microglial activation and enhanced immune cell infiltration have been <lb/>recently reported by IHC staining in a series of 43 COVID-19 brains, with the degree of <lb/>infiltration and glial activation not clearly correlated with neurological symptoms or the presence <lb/>of detectable virus in the brain 5 . Our results largely corroborate those findings via an orthogonal <lb/>snRNA-seq approach (Fig. 4a-e). Both the formation of a distinct microglial cluster and the <lb/>enhanced infiltration of peripheral T-cells and macrophages did not occur in terminal influenza, <lb/>suggesting a COVID-19 specific-or at least not a pan-viral-CNS response. <lb/>Because we collected sufficient microglia for DEG analysis, we sought a clearer <lb/>understanding of the functional ramifications of their COVID-19 activation. As expected, <lb/>established markers of microglial activation previously linked to pathologic functions such as <lb/>CD74 and MERTK were strongly upregulated 67-74 . We observed a concomitant loss of the <lb/></body>

			<body>immune checkpoint molecules MEF2C and IRAK3 that restrain runaway inflammation 75-77 . <lb/>Recently, increased microglial phagocytosis of live neurons-termed phagoptosis-has been <lb/>demonstrated to be an important mechanism driving various neurodegenerative diseases 71,78-81 . <lb/>Remarkably, nearly every gene reported 81 to mediate microglial phagocytosis of live neurons is <lb/>strongly upregulated in COVID-19 microglia (Fig. 4g). These include the genes encoding <lb/>complement proteins C3, all three components of C1Q, and the pro-phagocytic receptors <lb/>MERTK and VNR. Together, these data reveal in the COVID-19 brain the infiltration of immune <lb/>cells and strong activation of a pathologic microglial phagocytosis program predicted to <lb/>prematurely engulf and prune live neurons. <lb/>Potential synaptic dysfunction specifically in layer 2/3 excitatory neurons <lb/>The global induction of microglial phagoptosis programs prompted us to look into other <lb/>potential signatures of neuronal compromise. Astrocytes play a dual role in both forming the glia <lb/>limitans barrier 82,83 and supporting homeostatic neuronal function 84-86 (Fig. 5a). Given SARS-<lb/>CoV-2 infection of barrier cells, we thus wondered whether astrocytes would exhibit similar <lb/>hallmarks of inflammation with concomitant consequences for neuronal health. We indeed <lb/>observed hallmarks of astrogliosis 87 and viral defense 50 in upregulated GFAP and IFITM3 <lb/>expression, as well as neurotoxicity in the secreted factor CHI3L1 88-90 (Fig. 3b, Fig. 5a-d). <lb/>Forming a tripartite synapse with neurons, astrocytes finely balance the levels of synaptic <lb/>neurotransmitters like glutamate via the dedicated transporters EEAT1 (SLC1A3) and EEAT2 <lb/>(SLC1A2) 91-93 . Dysregulated glutamate transporter expression causes neuronal dysfunction: <lb/>downregulation results in excess glutamate excitotoxicity 94,95 and extrasynaptic spillover 96,97 ; <lb/>whereas upregulation impairs long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic plasticity 98-101 . We <lb/>observed dysregulated overexpression of genes predicting diminished glutamate signaling <lb/>across synapses: for example, the overexpression of both glutamate transporters (SLC1A2 and <lb/>SLC1A3, Fig. 5a, e) as well as the major potassium uptake channel Kir4.1 (KCNJ10), which <lb/>reduces neuronal excitability by lowering extracellular potassium, glutamate, and BDNF 102 . <lb/>We next sought to identify the neuronal subtypes affected in COVID-19. Enrichment <lb/>analysis implicated potential impairments in synaptic transmission specifically in excitatory <lb/>neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9). Among COVID-19 patients, those with objective neurological <lb/>symptoms or detectable virus did not exhibit further deficits in the expression of genes <lb/>mediating synaptic transmission (Extended Data Fig. 9c, Extended Data Table 1). Glutamate <lb/>release at synapses is critical for fast and faithful communication between neurons for <lb/>information processing in sub-second timeframes 103-105 . Glutamate is stored in readily <lb/></body>

			<body>releasable pools of vesicles within presynaptic terminals. During synaptic transmission, SNARE <lb/>proteins play an indispensable role in vesicle docking, priming, fusion, and synchronization of <lb/>glutamate release into the synaptic cleft 103,104 . Downregulation of the mRNA encoding SNARE <lb/>components has been found in various neurological diseases 106-109 , and is sufficient in <lb/>experimental models to impair both vesicle processing and overall neuronal viability 110-114 . We <lb/>observed in COVID-19 excitatory neurons a consistent downregulation of major SNARE <lb/>components (Fig. 5f). For example, genes encoding both v-SNARE synaptobrevins (VAMP1, <lb/>VAMP2) necessary for calcium-dependent glutamate release 115,116 decreased. Likewise, <lb/>expression diminished for the partner t-SNARE proteins syntaxin 1B (STX1B) and SNAP-25, <lb/>also necessary 117,118 for glutamate release. <lb/>The human neocortex is composed of six layers of interconnected excitatory and <lb/>inhibitory neurons, with each layer both highly specialized locally and integrated globally. Of <lb/>these six layers, layers 2 and 3 are disproportionately thickened during the evolution of the <lb/>human brain, playing a key role in higher brain functions such as cognition, learning, memory, <lb/>creativity, and abstraction 4,119,120 . Though we captured neurons from all cortical layers, we found <lb/>that gene expression changes linked to synaptic deficits are specific to only these layer 2/3 <lb/>excitatory neurons (Fig. 5g). L2/3 excitatory neurons already exhibit sparse action potential <lb/>firing to generate a simple and reliable neural code for associative learning 120 . Thus, this <lb/>neuronal population may be particularly sensitive to the predicted deficits in neurotransmission <lb/>with COVID-19. Together, these data suggest potential impairments in L2/3 neuron synaptic <lb/>transmission, plasticity, and LTP in COVID-19, due to the dysregulation of genes mediating <lb/>astrocyte glutamate homeostasis and genes encoding major synaptic vesicle components. <lb/>Associations with chronic CNS disease <lb/>Reports of lingering CNS complications in COVID-19 survivors are emerging 121 . To <lb/>provide a molecular rationale for these complications, we compared COVID-19 cell type-specific <lb/>DEGs with those recently described by snRNA-seq in chronic CNS diseases, including <lb/>Alzheimer&apos;s disease 34 , multiple sclerosis 122 , Huntington&apos;s disease 123 , and autism spectrum <lb/>disorder 33 . Surprisingly, the overlap of DEGs between COVID-19 and these chronic CNS <lb/>diseases was over-represented for each cell type (Fig. 6a, Extended Data Fig. 10, Extended <lb/>Data Table 7). The degree of overlap was particularly high in astrocytes and excitatory neurons. <lb/>For example, genes encoding the SNARE protein SNAP-25 and the neurotrophic factor BDNF <lb/>were commonly downregulated in excitatory neurons in both COVID-19 and Alzheimer&apos;s <lb/></body>

			<body>disease 34 . This over-representation of overlapping DEGs suggests existing CNS disease <lb/>knowledge-and even treatment approaches-may be relevant to COVID-19 neuropathology. <lb/>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shed insight into the molecular <lb/>pathways involved in complex traits and diseases 124,125 . GWAS variants suggest an important <lb/>role for a given gene through its loss or gain of function or expression. Thus, differential <lb/>expression of GWAS genes in COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these trait and disease <lb/>pathways 32 . To determine the enrichment of COVID-19 DEGs within genetic variants associated <lb/>with complex traits and diseases in a cell type-specific fashion, we obtained GWAS summary <lb/>statistics for neurological and psychiatric disorders and neurobehavior traits (Extended Data <lb/>Table 8) 125-127 . We found a strong enrichment of DEGs residing within GWAS hits of various <lb/>disorders and traits, especially in cognition, schizophrenia, and depression (Fig. 6b). These <lb/>particular disorders have been associated with dysfunction in L2/3 neurons and astrocytes 128-<lb/>135 . Together, these data suggest that COVID-19 may partially recapitulate established <lb/>pathological processes in the brain and provide molecular hypotheses for emerging neurological <lb/>complaints in COVID-19 survivors. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Recent snRNA-seq studies have elucidated the cell type-specific processes involved in <lb/>several CNS diseases 32-35,122,123 . Here, by combining sequencing of 47,678 nuclei in both frontal <lb/>cortex and choroid plexus along with IHC detection of SARS-CoV-2 in brain-barrier cells, we <lb/>reveal several major neuropathological mechanisms in severe COVID-19. Based on gene <lb/>expression patterns uncovered in this study, we propose a model where SARS-CoV-2 infected <lb/>brain-barrier cells can relay and permit inflammatory signaling into the cortex parenchyma. In <lb/>this inflammatory milieu, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate neuronal <lb/>phagocytosis programs, and astrocyte homeostatic properties become dysregulated. Microglial <lb/>activation is sufficient to induce a COVID-19 specific subpopulation. Together, these <lb/>perturbations may converge on impaired neuronal function, with L2/3 excitatory neurons in <lb/>particular exhibiting a transcriptomic signature of compromised glutamate transmission and <lb/>information processing 4,119,120 . <lb/>There are, however, limitations to consider given the unique logistical circumstances of a <lb/>pandemic. With most postmortem COVID-19 brain tissue immediately fixed 42 or not handled <lb/>with snRNA-seq studies in mind for safety and regulatory reasons, there is a lack of the high-<lb/>quality tissue necessary for such studies 21,23,24 . This has precluded larger study cohorts that <lb/>could be more representative of COVID-19 patients as a whole. For example, while we and a <lb/></body>

			<body>recent IHC-based study of 43 patient brains 5 (the largest to date) do not find a clear correlation <lb/>between detectable brain SARS-CoV-2 and glial inflammation or neurological symptoms, this <lb/>may not be representative of all patients, especially those without pre-existing co-morbidities or <lb/>who do not require ventilation 136 . Furthermore, the associations with chronic CNS disease may <lb/>not be relevant in mild COVID-19 disease and may change over time in severe COVID-19 <lb/>survivors. Long-term postmortem studies of survivors after the acute phase of disease are not <lb/>currently possible to assess this. However, there is precedent for acute viral infections causing <lb/>long-term inflammation and dysfunction predisposing neurodegenerative disease 137-140 . <lb/>Understanding the underlying mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 affects the brain may <lb/>inform therapeutic approaches 121 . Most molecular studies to date on SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism <lb/>have made powerful use of cultured organoids, though they have reached conflicting <lb/>conclusions 21-26 . Here, in postmortem COVID-19 patient tissue, we find that the blood-brain and <lb/>blood-CSF barrier cells typically lacking in organoid models are of high physiologic relevance in <lb/>informing questions of neurotropism. By combining IHC with a new method to process human <lb/>choroid plexi tissue for snRNA-seq, we propose that infection of brain-barrier cells can generate <lb/>a depot of strong antiviral inflammation and compromise barrier function, combining to inflame <lb/>the brain parenchyma. Such brain-barrier relay and permeability mechanisms have been found <lb/>important in brain aging 59,141-144 . Thus, COVID-19&apos;s impact on the brain, like many of its other <lb/>properties, may follow a nuanced-but potentially therapeutically targetable-mechanism of <lb/>action. We propose that the development of new techniques to study human brain-barrier cells <lb/>will further help elucidate disease processes in COVID-19 and beyond. <lb/>The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic means thousands of people may suffer <lb/>neurological symptoms, with some facing lifelong problems as a result. Our results nominate <lb/>COVID-19 pathologic processes in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons not seen in a patient <lb/>suffering terminal influenza infection. The particular vulnerability of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons <lb/>in COVID-19 provides a consistent molecular hypothesis for emerging neurological complaints, <lb/>from &quot;brain fog&quot; to memory loss to difficulty concentrating 11,145,146 . Several COVID-19 <lb/>perturbations revealed here may be addressable with existing medications 147 . However, as is <lb/>the case for recent human transcriptomic studies, additional research will be required to link the <lb/>observed cell type-specific gene expression changes with neurological symptoms 32,33,35,122,123 . <lb/>Nevertheless, these studies have served as important resources for understanding the <lb/>molecular and cellular basis of disease and for formulating new lines of investigation. In <lb/>summary, this work sheds insight into and provides new opportunities to explore the acute and <lb/>lasting neurological consequences of COVID-19. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>Isolation of nuclei from frozen post-mortem medial frontal gyrus <lb/>Frozen medial frontal cortex tissue from post-mortem control and COVID-19 patients were <lb/>obtained from the Stanford/ VA/ NIA Aging Clinical Research Center (ACRC) and the Saarland <lb/>University Hospital Institute for Neuropathology, with approval from local ethics committees. <lb/>Group characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 1. The protocol for the isolation of <lb/>nuclei was adapted from previous studies 32,34,35,148,149 , and performed in a BSL2+ Biosafety <lb/>Cabinet wearing PPE. All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4°C. Briefly, 50 mg of post-<lb/>mortem brain tissue was dounce homogenized in 2 ml of Nuclei EZ Prep Lysis Buffer (Sigma, <lb/>NUC101) spiked with 0.2 U μl −1 RNase inhibitor (Takara, 2313A) and EDTA-free Protease <lb/>Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 11873580001) before incubating on ice for 5 min in a final volume of 5 <lb/>ml. Homogenized tissue was filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer (Falcon, 352360), mixed <lb/>with an equal volume of 50% iodixanol density gradient medium in PBS (OptiPrep, Sigma-<lb/>Aldrich, D1556) to make a final concentration of 25% iodixanol. 30% iodixanol was layered <lb/>underneath the 25% mixture. Similarly, 40% iodixanol was layered underneath the 30% <lb/>iodixanol. In a swinging-bucket centrifuge, nuclei were centrifuged for 20 min at 3,000 r.c.f. After <lb/>centrifugation, the nuclei were present at the interface of the 30% and 40% iodixanol solutions. <lb/>Isolated nuclei were resuspended in 1% BSA with 0.2 U μl −1 RNase inhibitor, filtered twice <lb/>through a 40 μm strainer (Flowmi), and counted on an TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad) <lb/>after the addition of Trypan Blue. We did not use statistical methods to pre-determine sample <lb/>sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications 30-32 . <lb/>Isolation of nuclei from frozen post-mortem choroid plexus <lb/>Frozen choroid plexus tissue was extracted from the lateral ventricles of post-mortem tissue <lb/>obtained from the Stanford University Pathology department and the Saarland University <lb/>Hospital Institute for Neuropathology, with approval from local ethics committees. Group <lb/>characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 1. All procedures were carried out on ice <lb/>or at 4°C, and in a BSL2+ Biosafety Cabinet wearing PPE. Dounce homogenization or <lb/>enzymatic dissociation successfully used for mice choroid plexi 29 resulted in loss of nuclei <lb/>integrity and low nuclei complexity (&lt;50 median genes/ nuclei). We hypothesized that like <lb/>shaking an apple tree, gentle pipetting of choroid plexi tissue in lysis buffer could liberate nuclei <lb/>without needing to physically disintegrate the fibrous choroid matrix-and thus avoid collateral <lb/>physical damage to nuclei. Specifically, 40 mg of choroid plexus tissue was thawed in 250 μl of <lb/>1% BSA with 0.2 U μl −1 RNase inhibitor until the tissue settled. 5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, <lb/>10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P40 substitute (Roche/ Sigma, 11754599001), 0.2 U <lb/>μl −1 RNase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor) was added and tissue incubated on ice for 10 <lb/>minutes with gentle swirling every 2 minutes. 5 ml of 1% BSA was added and the tissue <lb/>triturated 10 times with a 5 ml serological pipette. After centrifugation (500g, 5 min), pelleted <lb/>nuclei were resuspended in 1% BSA with 0.2 U μl −1 RNase inhibitor; gently triturated 10 times <lb/>with a 1 ml regular-bore pipette tip; and filtered twice through a 70 μm and then a 40 μm strainer <lb/>(Flowmi). Debris was inspected on a brightfield microscope and nuclei were counted on an <lb/>TC20 automated cell counter (Bio-Rad) after the addition of Trypan Blue. <lb/>Droplet-based snRNA-sequencing <lb/>For droplet-based snRNA-seq, libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single <lb/>Cell 3ʹ v3.1 according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol (10x Genomics), targeting 10,000 nuclei <lb/>per sample after counting with a TC20 Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad). 13 cycles were <lb/>applied to brain parenchyma samples to generate cDNA, and 15 for choroid plexus samples. All <lb/>samples underwent 15-16 cycles for final library generation. Generated snRNA-seq libraries <lb/>were sequenced across two S4 lanes on a NovaSeq 6000 (150 cycles, Novogene). <lb/></body>

Three <lb/>approaches were combined for quality control: (1) ambient cell free mRNA contamination was <lb/>removed using SoupX 151 for each individual sample; (2) outliers with a high ratio of <lb/>mitochondrial (&gt;5%, &lt;200 features) relative to endogenous RNAs and homotypic doublets (&gt; <lb/>5000 features) were removed in Seurat 152 ; and (3) after scTransform normalization and <lb/>integration, doublets and multiplets were filtered out using DoubletFinder with subsequent <lb/>manual inspection and filtering based on cell type-specific marker genes 153 . Genes detected in <lb/>fewer than 4 cells were excluded. After applying these filtering steps, the dataset contained <lb/>47,678 high-quality nuclei. <lb/>Cell annotations <lb/>Seurat&apos;s Integration function was used to align data with default settings. Genes were projected <lb/>into principal component (PC) space using the principal component analysis (RunPCA). The <lb/>first 80 (for global object), 30 (choroid plexus), or 25 (specific cell types) dimensions were used <lb/>as inputs into Seurat&apos;s FindNeighbors, FindClusters (at 0.2 resolution) and RunUMAP functions. <lb/>Briefly, a shared-nearest-neighbor graph was constructed based on the Euclidean distance <lb/>metric in PC space, and cells were clustered using the Louvain method. RunUMAP functions <lb/>with default settings was used to calculate 2-dimensional UMAP coordinates and search for <lb/>distinct cell populations. Positive differential expression of each cluster against all other clusters <lb/>(MAST) was used to identify marker genes for each cluster 154 . We annotated cell-types using <lb/>previously published marker genes 31,33-35 . <lb/>Differential gene expression and sub-cluster analysis <lb/>Differential gene expression of genes comparing controls, COVID-19, and influenza samples-<lb/>or comparing cell type sub-cluster markers-was done using the MAST 154 algorithm, which <lb/>implements a two-part hurdle model. Seurat default Log (fold change) &gt; 0.25 (absolute value), <lb/>adjusted P value (Bonferroni correction) &lt; 0.05, and expression in greater than 10% of cells <lb/>were required to consider a gene differentially expressed. Biological pathway and gene ontology <lb/>enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr 155 , Metascape 156 , or GeneTrail 3 157 with input <lb/>species set to Homo sapiens 156 and using standard parameters. Docking, processing, and viral <lb/>defense genes relevant to SARS-CoV-2 were chosen based on Iadecola, et al 16 . To identify <lb/>microglia sub-cluster markers, differential expression analysis of cells grouped in each sub-<lb/>cluster was performed against the remaining cells within the given cell-type. Markers were <lb/>defined based on the MAST algorithm using only positive values with Log (fold change) &gt; 0.25 <lb/>(absolute value), adjusted P value (Bonferroni correction) &lt; 0.01. Enrichment/ over-<lb/>representation of the overlap between markers defining the COVID-19 microglia 2 cluster and <lb/>the Mathys 34 Alzheimer&apos;s disease Mic1 cluster followed the hypergeometric probability, using <lb/>the set of 17,926 protein-coding genes as background. <lb/>Monocle trajectory analysis <lb/>Monocle3 (v.0.2.1.) was used to generate the pseudotime trajectory analysis in microglia 64 . <lb/>Cells were re-clustered as above and used as input into Monocle to infer cluster and lineage <lb/>relationships within a given cell type. Specifically, UMAP embeddings and cell sub-clusters <lb/>generated from Seurat were converted to a cell_data_set object using SeuratWrappers (v.0.2.0) <lb/></body>

			<body>and then used as input to perform trajectory graph learning and pseudo-time measurement <lb/>through reversed graph embedding with Monocle. <lb/>Viral transcripts <lb/>To search for SARS-CoV-2 reads, raw fastq files were subjected to read alignment via Viral-<lb/>Track 158 or centrifuge 159 using the human (GRCh38) genome reference. For Viral-Track both a <lb/>collection of 12,163 consensus virus sequences from Virusite 160 (release 2020.3) and 17,133 <lb/>curated SARS-CoV-2 genomes from NCBI (downloaded on 29-09-2020) were used. For <lb/>centrifuge, a preprocessed virus index compiled by genexa containing among other viruses 138 <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 genomes was used. We also adopted a complementary approach 161 focusing on <lb/>SARS-CoV-2 reads, whereby barcoded but unmapped BAM reads were aligned using STAR to <lb/>the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, with a less stringent mapping parameter <lb/>(outFilterMatchNmin 25-30) than the original Viral-Track pipeline. <lb/>Cell-cell communication <lb/>Cell-cell interactions based on the expression of known ligand-receptor pairs in different cell <lb/>types were inferred using CellChatDB 61 (v.0.02). To identify potential cell-cell communication <lb/>networks perturbed or induced in COVID-19 patient brains, we focused on differentially <lb/>expressed ligands in choroid plexus epithelium, microglia, and astrocytes; and differentially <lb/>expressed receptor pairs in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Briefly, we followed the official <lb/>workflow and loaded the normalized counts into CellChat and applied the preprocessing <lb/>functions identifyOverExpressedGenes, identifyOverExpressedInteractions, and projectData <lb/>with standard parameters set. As database we selected the Secreted Signaling pathways and <lb/>used the pre-compiled human Protein-Protein-Interactions as a priori network information. For <lb/>the main analyses the core functions computeCommunProb, computeCommunProbPathway, <lb/>and aggregateNet were applied using standard parameters and fixed randomization seeds. <lb/>Finally, to determine the senders and receivers in the network the function <lb/>netAnalysis_signalingRole was applied on the netP data slot. <lb/>GWAS <lb/>From the GWAS catalog 126 , we obtained GWAS risk genes for neurological disorders <lb/>[Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brain aging, multiple system <lb/>atrophy (MSA), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD), and narcolepsy], psychiatric <lb/>disorders [Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, bipolar disorder, depression, <lb/>psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizophrenia], and neurobehavior traits <lb/>[Anxiety, suicidality, insomnia, neuroticism, risk behavior, intelligence, and cognitive function]. <lb/>We removed gene duplicates and GWAS loci either not reported or in intergenic regions and <lb/>used a P &lt; 9 × 10 −6 to identify significant associations 32 . Then, since GWAS signals can point to <lb/>multiple candidate genes within the same locus, we focused on the &apos;Reported Gene(s)&apos; (genes <lb/>reported as associated by the authors of each GWAS study). Disorders and traits exhibiting a <lb/>significant number of genes also perturbed in COVID-19 patients are highlighted. Following <lb/>gene symbol extraction, we curated the gene set by (1) removing unknown or outdated gene <lb/>names using the HGNChelper package (v.0.8.6), (2) converting remaining Ensembl gene IDs to <lb/>actual gene names using the packages ensembldb (v.2.10.0) and EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86 <lb/>(v.2.99.0), and (3) removing any remaining duplicates. We then calculated the overlap between <lb/>each set of GWAS genes with the cell type-specific DEGs. Finally, a statistical enrichment of <lb/>each overlap against background was calculated using a hypergeometric test with the total <lb/>background size set equal to the number of unique RNAs mapped in our data set (29,431). <lb/>Comparison of DEGs in chronic CNS disease <lb/></body>

			<body>We compiled cell type-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reported in published <lb/>datasets for Alzheimer&apos;s Disease (AD) 34 , Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 33 , Huntington&apos;s <lb/>disease (HD) 123 , and Multiple sclerosis (MS) 122 . Lists of gene symbols were curated using the <lb/>aforementioned approach. COVID-19 DEGs that overlap with those found across the selected <lb/>CNS diseases were called shared, whereas those not previously reported were called unique to <lb/>COVID-19. Statistical significance calculations of over-representation in DEG overlaps are <lb/>based on cumulative hypergeometric P values analogous to the procedure described above. <lb/>PVCA and PCA analysis <lb/>Briefly, to conduct the Principal Variance Component Analysis (PVCA), we aggregated the <lb/>SoupX corrected raw counts for each gene and each biological sample using the aggregateData <lb/>function of the muscat package (v.1.2.1). The resulting matrix was normalized by dividing each <lb/>feature of a sample by the total counts from that sample, multiplied by a scaling factor of <lb/>100,000 and scaling the result using the function log(x+1). As variables we considered the <lb/>sample annotation fields &quot;Sample-ID&quot;, &quot;Patient-ID&quot;, &quot;Sex&quot;, &quot;Brain-region&quot;, &quot;Disease&quot;, &quot;ageBin&quot;, <lb/>and &quot;nNucleiBin&quot;. Since the number of nuclei and age are numeric variables but PVCA is <lb/>designed to support factors, we assigned the values into ordered bins, more specifically, into <lb/>five half-open (left-closed) intervals of size 1,000 starting at 2,000 for the number of nuclei and <lb/>five similarly defined intervals of size 10 starting at 51 for the age. We set the algorithm cut-off <lb/>for the minimal variance out of the total variance being explained to be 95%. For each single <lb/>annotation variable, or first higher-order combinations of such, at cut-off of 0.005 was applied to <lb/>consider them explanatory. All variables (or combinations of such) not passing the threshold <lb/>were summarized as Other in the analysis. The residual is then defined as the remaining <lb/>proportion of variance not being associated with any of the variables that are explanatory nor <lb/>informative to a minor proportion. To conduct Principal Components Analysis (PCA) we <lb/>aggregated the log-normalized cell counts from Seurat for each gene and sample using the <lb/>aggregateData function from muscat and centered the gene expression vectors before <lb/>computing eigenvectors. <lb/>Overall in-silico analysis <lb/>Analysis and dissection of the data was performed using the statistical programming language <lb/>R (v.3.6.3) using the following general-purpose package for loading, saving, and manipulating <lb/>data, as well as generating plots, and fitting statistical models: dplyr (v.1.0.0), ggplot2 (v.3.2.2.), <lb/>patchwork (v.1.0.1), openxlsx (v.4.1.5), bioconductor-scater (v.1.14.6), bioconductor-dropletutils <lb/>(v1.6.1), bioconductor-complexheatmap (v.2.2.0), tidyverse (v.1.3.0), and lsa (v.0.73.2). All <lb/>other tasks were performed on an x86_64-based Ubuntu (4.15.0-55-generic kernel) server <lb/>cluster. <lb/>Immunohistochemistry <lb/>Paraffin-embedded human brain tissue (medial frontal cortex, meninges, and choroid plexus) <lb/>adjacent to tissue processed for snRNA-seq was subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC). <lb/>After deparaffinization and rehydration of 1-3 µm sections, peroxidases were blocked by <lb/>incubation in 1% H2O2 for 15 minutes at room temperature. Heat antigen retrieval was <lb/>performed by steaming at 98°C in target retrieval solution pH 6.1 (Dako, Carpinteira, CA, USA <lb/>#S1699) for 30 minutes. Sections were allowed to cool down at room temperature. Following <lb/>antigen retrieval, sections were incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature with the anti-<lb/>SARS spike glycoprotein antibody 3A2 (rabbit, Abcam ab272420 1:100 diluted in Dako REAL <lb/>antibody diluent #S2022), which has been validated in previous publications 20,41 .
