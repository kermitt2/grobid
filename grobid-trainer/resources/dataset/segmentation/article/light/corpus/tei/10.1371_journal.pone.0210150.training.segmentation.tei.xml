Research was conducted to evaluate the quality of male condoms available in <lb/>the Dominican Republic market based on preliminary concerns of suspect product. Based <lb/>on international testing standards (ISO 4074 and ASTM D 3492-08), condoms were sam-<lb/>pled across ten prominent brands within the market and evaluated for airburst pressure / vol-<lb/>ume, freedom from holes, visual defects, package seal integrity, packaging and marking, <lb/>lubricant quantity, and dimensions. Five of the brands were found to have extensive quality <lb/>problems, where holes were found in 5.7% to 17.5% of the condoms (depending on the <lb/>brand). Between 5.1% and 30.5% of these condoms failed to meet the requirements for air-<lb/>burst properties, and violations in regulatory labeling where observed. Three additional <lb/>brands were compliant for the other tests, but were found to have the same challenges with <lb/>labeling violations as the previous five brands. Two brands were found to be fully compliant <lb/>with all aspects of the evaluation. The level of defects observed in these samples would <lb/>greatly increase the risk of HIV transmission (and other STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. <lb/>When projected on the annual market of male condoms sold in the Dominican Republic <lb/>(~26 million), potentially over 1 million condoms could be estimated to adversely impact the <lb/>health risk of the end-user. These results prompted action by the Dominican Republic regu-<lb/>latory authorities to investigate and remove poor quality product from the market. This <lb/>research study emphasizes the need for continued vigilance towards increased regulatory <lb/>and market surveillance efforts to better protect public health interests. <lb/></front>

			<body>(especially for anti-malarials) [1-10], but other product types can be at risk for quality issues. <lb/>Specifically for condoms, concerns regarding quality have been reported in Ethiopia [11], Viet-<lb/>nam [12], India [13], and China [14], where problems ranged from holes in the condoms, rup-<lb/>ture during use, and falsified branding. <lb/>Male latex condoms are a key commodity to prevent unintended pregnancies and transmis-<lb/>sion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections <lb/>(STIs) [15]. Billions of condoms are manufactured and procured annually, and it was esti-<lb/>mated in 2015 that 27 billion condoms were globally available to provide approximately 225 <lb/>million couple years protection (level of protection provided over a one year period) from <lb/>unintended pregnancies and significantly reduced rates of HIV and other STIs [16]. In the <lb/>Dominican Republic, high quality condoms are needed to prevent continued transmission of <lb/>HIV, STIs, and reduction in unintended pregnancies. With 66,000 people currently living with <lb/>HIV in the Dominican Republic, sustained efforts to control transmission remain important. <lb/>Condoms remain a cornerstone of the HIV prevention effort, as well as an important con-<lb/>traceptive method, with 67.4% of young men who have multiple partners reporting use of a <lb/>condom during their last sexual intercourse [17]. <lb/>Male condoms are a regulated commodity in most countries requiring approval from a <lb/>national (or regional) regulatory authority or ministry of health prior to market use to help <lb/>ensure that these meet technical and quality standards. International standards (i.e., ISO 4074 <lb/>[18] and ISO 13485 [19]) are used to regulate condom production to ensure acceptable quality <lb/>standards are met. <lb/>Here we report the outcome of research in the Dominican Republic that began as part of a <lb/>preliminary distribution check (through the Ministry of Health) where poor quality condom <lb/>brands were suspected to be available in ~60% of grocery stores and ~40% of pharmacies <lb/>within the general Dominican Republic market. The United States Agency for International <lb/>Development (USAID) mission office in the Dominican Republic requested an investigation <lb/>of the quality of multiple condom brands available in the country. USAID, with support of the <lb/>Ministry of Health, engaged FHI 360 for quality assurance testing in order to ascertain poten-<lb/>tial health risks. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Condom brands were chosen for testing based upon an initial visual review of the product and <lb/>packaging of a small sample of each brand, yielding eight condom brands suspected to have <lb/>quality issues. Two additional brands were sampled for testing as controls that originated from <lb/>known high-quality manufacturers that performed well on pre-shipment testing prior to <lb/>arrival in-country. After consultation and approval from the Ministry of Health and the Direc-<lb/>cio ´n General de Drogas y Farmacias, USAID/Dominican Republic sampled from various loca-<lb/>tions in the greater Santo Domingo area and shipped a total of ten condom brands (720 <lb/>condoms for brands 1-7 and 9-10; brand 8 had 360 condoms) for testing. For each brand, <lb/>samples were from the same lot. All condom brands chosen for testing were readily available <lb/>in the Dominican Republic at the time of testing. Specific manufacturer and product brand <lb/>names are not disclosed, but rather sampled brands are identified with a numerical code. All <lb/>samples obtained were well within the listed expiration date at the time of testing. <lb/>All tests were conducted based on ISO 4074 procedures [18], where the number of samples <lb/>tested were based on requirements in ISO 4074:2002 [18a], ASTM D3492-8 [20], and ISO <lb/>2859-1 [21] sampling procedure for inspection by attributes based on lot size. Although actual <lb/>lot sizes for each brand was unknown, sample sizes (Table 1) were based on our knowledge <lb/></body>

The inflation length of the condom was <lb/>150 ± 3 mm and the test mandrel had a hemispherical diameter of 25 mm. The machine deliv-<lb/>ered clean (oil/moisture-free) air at a rate of 24-30 dm 3 /min, verified daily with an annually <lb/>calibrated flow-meter (Sierra Instruments-Model 822-13-OV1-PV1-V1). The pressure was <lb/>measured with annually calibrated transducers (Prosense-Model PTD25-20-0100WCH) in <lb/>kilopascals (to the nearest 0.1 kPa). Condoms with widths � 50.0 mm must have a minimum <lb/>airburst volume of 16.0 dm 3 , and condoms with widths 50.0-56.0 mm must have a minimum <lb/>airburst volume of 18.0 dm 3 . The burst pressure must be a minimum of 1.0 kPa regardless of <lb/>width. Unless stated otherwise, 315 condom samples were tested for each brand. <lb/>Visual defects <lb/>Testing followed ISO 4074:2002 [18a] (section 9, Annex L.2.3.3, and L.3.3.4). Condoms <lb/>selected for the freedom from holes (FFH) test were first subjected to the visible defects test. <lb/>Upon removing from the condom package, they were unrolled and inspected for visible holes, <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>tears and other visible defects as described in the applicable standards and specifications. If vis-<lb/>ible holes or tears were observed, the condom was considered non-compliant and further tests <lb/>were halted (for that condom). Other visible defects were recorded and the condom then was <lb/>subjected to the FFH test. Unless stated otherwise, 315 condom samples were evaluated for <lb/>each brand. <lb/>Freedom from holes (FFH) <lb/>Testing followed ASTM D3492-8 Section A3. Equipment used was non-branded and built spe-<lb/>cifically to meet the FFH requirements to deliver 300 ± 10 ml of water with a temperature <lb/>between 10˚C and 40˚C. The test mounts were free of defects that may damage and allowed <lb/>the condom to hang freely from the machine. Samples were filled with water and allowed to <lb/>hang for at least one minute. Each was manipulated by hand pushing water into the closed <lb/>end, middle and top of the condoms while examining for leaks. If leakage was noted, the con-<lb/>dom was marked and measured. Condoms identified with holes greater than 25 mm from the <lb/>open end were recorded as non-compliant. Unless stated otherwise, 315 condom samples were <lb/>tested for each brand after previously being evaluated for visible defects. <lb/>Package seal integrity <lb/>Testing followed ISO 4074:2002 [18a] (section 10 and Annex M). The equipment consists of a <lb/>plastic vacuum bell jar (Nalgene Amber PEI) capable of withstanding the required vacuum of <lb/>20 ± 5 kPa absolute pressure, a venturi vacuum pump (Cole Parmer Venturi-Style Model <lb/>78165-20) capable of obtaining the required pressure, compressed air source, calibrated vac-<lb/>uum gauge (Marshalltown 89998), clamping device and degassed water covering the test sam-<lb/>ples by no less than 25mm. The vacuum was applied to the samples for 1 minute. If a bubble <lb/>stream was observed from a package, it was determined to be non-compliant. Each package <lb/>was opened after removal form the vacuum chamber. If water was found inside the package, it <lb/>was determined to be non-compliant. Unless stated otherwise, 32 condom samples were evalu-<lb/>ated for each brand. <lb/>Packaging and marking <lb/>Testing followed ISO 4074:2002 [18a] section 11. If any packing or marking requirements <lb/>were not met, the condom was recorded as non-compliant. In addition, the retail, consumer, <lb/>and primary packaging of all samples were reviewed in accordance with the Dominican <lb/>Republic Ministry of Health, Direccio ´n General de Drogas y Farmacias regulatory labeling <lb/>requirements [22]. Unless stated otherwise, 32 condom samples were evaluated for each <lb/>brand. <lb/>Lubricant quantity <lb/>ISO 4074:2014 [18b] Annex C was followed which allows propan-2-ol or an aqueous surfactant <lb/>for removal of silicone lubricant from the condom. From internal data, the two methods were <lb/>compared for silicone lubricant removal using the h and k statistics used in ASTM E-691. Two <lb/>different condom lots (each from a different manufacturer) were evaluated with two replicates <lb/>from the more traditional propan-2-ol and four replicates with the aqueous surfactant method <lb/>using 0.5% Dawn Professional Detergent, Procter &amp; Gamble (50 ml of detergent diluted to 10 <lb/>L). Comparing the data from both methods found no outliers from any of the replicates, where <lb/>the overall measurement uncertainity was calculated to be ± 20 mg of silicone lubricant. The <lb/>laboratory was transitioning from propan-2-ol to the aqueous surfactant. Some lots were tested <lb/></body>

			<body>with propan-2-ol and others with aqueous surfactant. Brands 1, 4, 6, and 10 were tested with <lb/>the propan-2-ol and brands 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 were tested with the aqueous surfactant method. <lb/>Each condom package was weighed using a calibrated balance (AdventurePro AV213C) accu-<lb/>rate to 1 mg. Three sides of the condom package were opened using a scalpel, the condom was <lb/>removed, cut with a pair of scissors from the end to the center and then unrolled. The condom <lb/>and package were then washed with the cleaning solution and dried in a calibrated oven for at <lb/>least 15 minutes for propan-2-ol and 30 minutes for aqueous surfactant. The condom and <lb/>package were then reweighed. The difference between the initial weight and second weight <lb/>was recorded as the lubricant quantity. ISO 4074 [18] does not include a lubricant quantity <lb/>specification. WHO/UNFPA specifications [15] recommend silicone lubricant levels of 400-<lb/>700 mg (commonly applied to public markets), but lubricant levels outside of this range (i.e., <lb/>at lower levels) can be approved in commercial markets. Unless stated otherwise, 13 condom <lb/>samples were tested for each brand. <lb/>Dimensional tests <lb/>Testing followed ISO 4074:2002 [18a] section 5.3 (Annex D-F) with ASTM D3492-8 [20] sec-<lb/>tion 4.2.1.3. Length testing was done after removing the lubricant from whole condoms and <lb/>drying the condom. The condom was allowed to hang freely over a calibrated graduated man-<lb/>drel with a spherical radius of 12.5 mm, followed by recording the shortest length where any <lb/>length less than 160 mm was non-compliant. Using the same condom, width was determined <lb/>by placing the condom over a calibrated steel ruler at the narrowest part of the condom which <lb/>is 35 mm or less from the open end. From the stated nominal width, any measurement more <lb/>than ±2 mm was considered non-compliant. Using the same condom, thickness was measured <lb/>using the micrometer method (Annex F and ASTM D3492-8 section 4.2.1.3). The thickness <lb/>(double layer with condom laying flat) was taken at three points along the length (30 ± 5 mm, <lb/>90 ± 5 mm, and 150 ± 5 mm) using an ASTM D3767 [23] compliant thickness gauge with a <lb/>foot pressure of 22 ± 5 kPa. The results were averaged and divided by two to arrive at the single <lb/>wall thickness. ISO 4074 [18] does not include a thickness specification. WHO/UNFPA speci-<lb/>fications [15] recommend a thickness range of 0.045-0.080 mm (commonly applied to public <lb/>markets), but thicknesses outside of this range can be approved in commercial markets. Unless <lb/>stated otherwise, 13 condom samples were tested for each brand after previously being evalu-<lb/>ated for lubricant quantity. <lb/>Results <lb/>Test results for the ten condom brands sampled are provided in Table 1. Based on the test <lb/>results, all samples were then categorized into three distinct quality levels:&quot;poor quality / seri-<lb/>ous health risk,&quot;&quot;regulatory labeling violations,&quot; and&quot;acceptable quality.&quot; <lb/>Poor quality / Serious health risk <lb/>Sampled brands 1-5 failed to meet requirements for airburst pressure/volume, FFH, and pack-<lb/>aging and marking. Furthermore, samples from brand 2 did not meet the visible defects stan-<lb/>dard. For these five brands, between 5.1% and 30.5% of the condoms tested failed to meet the <lb/>minimum burst property requirements and are at risk of failing in use, and between 5.7% and <lb/>17.5% of the condoms tested had holes. Condoms with the number of quality defects observed <lb/>during testing would increase the health risk to consumers (assuming a direct correlation with <lb/>risk and defect level). <lb/>Regarding packaging, brands 1-5 were missing the required manufacturer/title holder <lb/>name information, where brands 4 and 5 did not include an expiration date or lot number on <lb/></body>

			<body>the outer box (inner foil packages did have expiration date and lot number). Brands 1, 2, 4, <lb/>and 5 did not include a registration number on the packaging. The validity of the registration <lb/>number from brand 3 was unable to be confirmed from available information. <lb/>Regulatory labeling violations <lb/>Although the quality differences of brands 6-8 were not as serious as the previous five brands <lb/>(with compliant results for airburst and FFH), sufficient packing and marking information <lb/>(including registration number) was not present based on international standards. Packaging <lb/>for brands 6 and 7 did not include manufacturer/title holder name and contact information. <lb/>Brand 6 did not include a lot number or an expiration date on the packaging. <lb/>Acceptable quality <lb/>There were no quality concerns raised with brands 9 and 10 because all international standard <lb/>and regulatory requirements were met for these samples [15,17,22]. These brands are com-<lb/>monly supplied by various donor agencies, such as USAID and UNFPA. <lb/>Other product observations <lb/>Lubricant levels of brands 1-8 were lower than brands 9 and 10. While all of these levels may <lb/>be compliant with market regulations, the range of lubricant observed may provide noticeable <lb/>differences during intercourse depending on user preferences. WHO/UNFPA specifications <lb/>indicate that condoms should be packaged in square or circular packages so the rolled condom <lb/>is not distorted from the circular shape [15]. Brands 1-8 were in rectangular packages which <lb/>cause the rolled condom to bend inside the package, thus distorting the condoms. It should be <lb/>noted that condoms in rectangular packages are available in some markets [24]. Changes in <lb/>physical properties of condoms may potentially be observed with different packaging shapes <lb/>during storage, but the level of impact should be evaluated for the product source and packag-<lb/>ing material used [25]. Brands 1-6 and 8 claimed that the condoms were scented, namely <lb/>chocolate, mint, orange, strawberry, grape, apple and fruit. Scents were difficult to detect, non-<lb/>existent, or did not match the description. Additionally, each scent could have a unique lot <lb/>number for easier traceability. Each brand only had one lot number without assigning a differ-<lb/>ent sub-lot number for scent. <lb/>Brands 2-4, 6 and 7 claimed to be dotted condoms, but these features were inconsistent in <lb/>terms of visualizing and feeling the dots. The ribbed features claimed on brand 5 were incon-<lb/>sistent, with some samples having easily identified ribs (could see and feel the ribs) and other <lb/>samples could be seen but not felt. Labeling from brand 3 could be interpreted as having con-<lb/>doms larger than average size, but was not substantiated from length and width measurements. <lb/>Brands 4 and 5 had identical lot numbers, which would be rare if manufactured by two differ-<lb/>ent companies as each company would have a unique assignment method. Brands 2-8 did not <lb/>contain detailed storage information and brand 3 did not provide disposal information. <lb/>The test results from this study indicate a high number of poor quality condoms in the mar-<lb/>ket. The most concerning results were the high number of defects for airburst and FFH <lb/>observed for brands 1-5. Although brands 1-8 had low lubricant levels and non-compliant <lb/>packaging/marking, problems with airburst and FFH will present the greatest risk to the end-<lb/>user because the barrier characteristics have a higher likelihood of being compromised. Based <lb/>on the results from Table 1, percent defectives were calculated for each of the brands for both <lb/>airburst and FFH testing, where sampled brands 9 and 10 are presented as control data (Fig 1). <lb/>Across brands 1-8, the overall average percent defective observed was 8.8% (interquartile <lb/></body>

For con-<lb/>traception, approximately 2% of couples using male condoms could become pregnant with <lb/>consistent / correct use during the first year, while increasing to 18% with typical use [26]. For <lb/>preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), consistent use of con-<lb/>doms can provide an efficacy ranging from ~80-95%, depending on the specific STI and route <lb/>of transmission [26]. <lb/>The high level of holes found in the condoms inherently demonstrates a comprised barrier. <lb/>Non-compliant results for airburst is an indication that the latex material does not have an <lb/>appropriate level of physical strength and homogeneity, thus increasing breakage risk during <lb/>Fig 1. Percent defective (based on number of failures found relative to the number tested as shown in Table 1) observed for both airburst and <lb/>freedom from holes testing for each sampled brand. <lb/>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0210150.g001 <lb/></body>

			<body>use [17]. Furthermore, low lubricant levels could present a different user perception during <lb/>intercourse. Although it is difficult to quantify the impact, the number of defects observed <lb/>would substantially decrease the overall expected efficacy experienced by the user for prevent-<lb/>ing unwanted pregnancies and STI transmission. <lb/>Approximately 26 million condoms are sold annually in the Dominican Republic, accord-<lb/>ing to a condom use market analysis [27]. One of the control brands in our study (within <lb/>brands 9 and 10) represents 48% of the market share in the Dominican Republic [27], while <lb/>the market share of the other control brand could be considered negligible. The overall percent <lb/>defective for brands 9 and 10 was estimated at 0.5% for airburst, and no holes were found in <lb/>any of the condoms tested. Thus, if we consider a condom quality comprised of a � 0.5% <lb/>defect level (for both defect types) on this portion of the market, then we can estimate approxi-<lb/>mately 12.5 million condoms offer adequate end user protection. <lb/>Our data suggest that several brands in the remaining 52% of the market share (approxi-<lb/>mately 13.5 million condoms) may have a range of product quality defects that could increase <lb/>the risk to the end user. Although the sampling of brands 1-8 was weighted towards suspect <lb/>product in the market and may inaccurately represent the distribution, the percent level of <lb/>defects observed for airburst and/or freedom from holes suggest that a high level of condoms <lb/>(potentially over 1 million) could present a serious risk to the end user. More specifically for <lb/>this portion of the market, the % defective levels (Fig 1) for airburst (with interquartile range) <lb/>observed for brands 1-8 project an average of 1.2 million defective condoms (range of 0.2-1.7 <lb/>million), where 1 million defective condoms (range of 0.01-1.9 million) could be estimated for <lb/>freedom from holes defects. <lb/>Based on these results, la Direccio ´n General de Medicamentos, Alimentos y Productos <lb/>Sanitarios (DIGEMAPS) del Ministerio de Salud (MS) in the Dominican Republic opened an <lb/>investigation of poor quality condoms in the market. Condoms have been removed from the <lb/>market in Santo Domingo, and DIGEMAP was in the process of removing the poor quality <lb/>condoms from the market in the outer provinces. With the exception of one condom brand, <lb/>authorities have not been able to assess the organization/individuals that brought the poor <lb/>quality condoms into Dominican Republic. To prevent future entry of these condoms, internal <lb/>measures and warnings were ordained, and an epidemiological alert was published and dis-<lb/>seminated [28]. <lb/>DIGEMAPS is committed to enforcing existing condom registration requirements and to <lb/>establishing a monitoring program to ensure that sub-standard condoms do not enter the <lb/>Dominican Republic market. USAID will continue to provide technical assistance to continue <lb/>to assess condom quality, and to train staff in procurement, storage and distribution of con-<lb/>doms and others contraceptive methods. <lb/>This investigation highlights the need to intensify product quality monitoring programs in <lb/>the Dominican Republic and other countries. Global experience suggests the number of coun-<lb/>tries in which poor quality condoms are entering the market is growing. Recent years have wit-<lb/>nessed news reports of the sale of large numbers of counterfeit or poor quality condoms in <lb/>China, Vietnam, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, Kenya, and Ghana. As sales of poor <lb/>quality or poorly regulated products grow in an increasingly globalized world, countries will <lb/>need to develop approaches to improve ongoing monitoring and regulation of product quality. <lb/>Although commonly considered in the context of medicines [29], several sources for poor <lb/>quality products exist concerning performance and labeling, namely poor original <lb/>manufacturing, deterioration in the field, and falsification of the product. Relatively simple <lb/>investigations, such as sampling product from pharmacies and grocery stores, allows for the <lb/>detection of poor quality products in the market. These activities, in addition to strengthening <lb/></body>

			<body>surveillance and regulatory resources (financial and human) are needed to improve monitor-<lb/>ing of product quality throughout the supply chain. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Product quality tests were conducted for male condom samples obtained from the Dominican <lb/>Republic market. Of the ten brands tested, five brands were observed to have serious levels of <lb/>defects for freedom from holes and airburst (a measure of physical integrity), including issues <lb/>with packaging / labeling. Three other brands were compliant for the other quality tests, but <lb/>demonstrated issues with packaging and labeling. Two of the brands showed no quality issues <lb/>with any of the evaluations conducted. Overall, the condom samples obtained demonstrated <lb/>serious product quality problems that would greatly reduce the expected effectiveness against <lb/>the prevention of HIV (and other STD) transmission and unwanted pregnancies. These results <lb/>were provided to the regulatory authorities in the Dominican Republic for further <lb/>investigation. <lb/></body>
