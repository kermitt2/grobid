			<front>Abstract <lb/>The tendency of animals to follow boundaries within their environment can serve as a strategy for spatial learning or <lb/>defence. We examined whether animals of Xenopus laevis employ such a strategy by characterizing their swimming <lb/>behaviour. We also investigated potential developmental changes, the influence of tentacles, which some of the <lb/>developmental stages possess, and whether wall-following is active (animals seek out wall contact) or passive. <lb/>Animals&apos; swimming movements were recorded with a camera from above in a square tank with shallow water and <lb/>their trajectories were analysed especially for proximity to the nearest wall. With the exception of young larvae, in <lb/>which wall following was less strong, the vast majority of animals -tadpoles and froglets -spent more time near the <lb/>wall than what would be expected from the proportion of the area near the wall. The total distance covered was not a <lb/>confounding factor. Wall following was also not influenced by whether the surrounding of the tank was black or <lb/>white, illuminated by infrared light, or by the presence or absence of tentacles. Animals were stronger wall followers <lb/>in smaller tanks. When given a choice in a convex tank to swim straight and leave the wall or turn to follow the wall, <lb/>the animals consistently left the wall, indicating that wall following in Xenopus laevis is passive. This implies that <lb/>wall following behaviour in Xenopus derives from constraints imposed by the environment (or the experimenter) <lb/>and is unlikely a strategy for spatial learning or safety-seeking. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>The exploratory behaviour of animals in unfamiliar environments is often characterized by a tendency to <lb/>follow walls or distinct borders. Such wall following has been described in mice and rats (Simon et al., 1994; Treit <lb/>and Fundytus, 1988), where it is often experimentally used as a readout for the level of the animal´s anxiety (Prut <lb/>and Belzung, 2003; Walsh and Cummins, 1976). Well-studied examples of wall following also include fruit flies <lb/>and blind cavefish (Besson and Martin, 2005; Goetz and Biesinger, 1985; Liu et al., 2007; Teyke, 1989). <lb/>Different potential functions have been ascribed to wall following behaviours. In some cases, wall <lb/>following might be a defensive strategy; for instance avian predators likely have more difficulties catching e.g. a rat <lb/>when the latter is moving along a wall compared to when it is moving across an open field (Grossen and Kelley, <lb/>1972). This explanation is supported by the fact that rats increase wall following in aversive situations (Grossen and <lb/>Kelley, 1972), and thus legitimate the use of wall following in rodents as an indicator of anxiety (Gentsch et al., <lb/>1987; Simon et al., 1994; Treit and Fundytus, 1988). On the other hand, wall following can also serve as a strategy <lb/>to learn the spatial setting of an environment. Blind cavefish, which live in dark caves without vision, explore <lb/>unfamiliar environments by swimming along vertical borders and thereby memorize the layout of the surrounding <lb/>(Teyke, 1989). A similar spatial learning has also been described in crayfish (Basil and Sandeman, 1999) and <lb/>humans (Kallai et al., 2005; Kallai et al., 2007), suggesting that wall following is widely used for spatial orientation <lb/>in vertebrates as well as invertebrates. <lb/>However, wall following does not necessarily imply that animals use this behaviour explicitly as a <lb/>defensive or exploratory strategy. In particular, simply observing a freely moving animal in a concave tank does not <lb/>indicate whether the animal actively seeks the proximity to the wall. A convex tank, on the other hand, can be used <lb/>to clearly distinguish between active and passive wall following (Creed and Miller, 1990). The convex curvature <lb/>allows the animal to chose to either continue straight and leave the wall, or to turn and follow the wall; the latter is <lb/>then termed active wall following. Accordingly, an animal might appear to be a strong wall follower in a square tank <lb/>simply because it has no option to make large turns and therefore continues to pursue the border (Creed and Miller, <lb/>1990). <lb/>To determine whether larvae and adults of the amphibian Xenopus laevis tend to swim along the walls of a <lb/>tank, we quantified the swimming behaviour of these animals in a square concave tank. In addition, tadpole <lb/>locomotion was recorded in square tanks of different sizes to assess the influence of the size of the environment. <lb/>Animals at different developmental stages -from small tadpoles (stage 46) to froglets -were employed to estimate <lb/>the effect of different locomotor styles as well as the role of mechanoreceptive tentacles, which are transiently <lb/>present at mid-larval stages, in wall following. Finally, a convex tank allowed discriminating between active and <lb/>passive wall following. <lb/>Materials and methods <lb/>Animals <lb/></body>

			<body>Experiments were performed on tadpoles and froglets of the South African clawed toad Xenopus laevis (n = <lb/>92) of either sex at developmental stage 46 to 66 (according to Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1956). Stages were identified <lb/>based on morphological features in freely moving animals in a petri dish under a dissection microscope. All animals <lb/>were obtained from in-house breeding at the Biocenter of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, where <lb/>animals were kept in aerated tanks at 17°C on a 12:12 hour light:dark cycle. All behavioural observations complied <lb/>with the &quot;Principles of animal care&quot;, publication No. 86-23, revised 1985 of the National Institute of Health. <lb/>Permission for experiments subjected to approval was granted by the Regierung von Oberbayern (55.2-1-54-2532.3-<lb/>59-12). <lb/>Image data acquisition -hardware and software <lb/>Image data were acquired with two different monochrome cameras from Point Grey (Richmond, Canada; now <lb/>FLIR Integrated Imaging Solutions) and Point Grey image acquisition software (Fly Capture). The camera was <lb/>placed in the centre above the tank to record the animal&apos;s movements in the horizontal plane. Videos obtained earlier <lb/>in the course of the study were acquired using a Grasshopper Firewire camera (GRAS-03K2M-C) with a 640 x 480 <lb/>resolution at 15 frames per second (fps). These videos were saved as JPG-compressed AVI files. Videos obtained <lb/>later in the course of the study were acquired using a Grasshopper3 USB camera (GS3-U3-23S6M-C) with a <lb/>maximum resolution of 1200 x 1200 pixels. The resolution was adjusted depending on animal and tank size and <lb/>varied from 600 x 600 to 1200 x 1200 pixels with a frame rate of either 15 or 30 fps. Acquired images were saved as <lb/>LZW-compressed TIFF files. All image data was visually inspected in FIJI (Schindelin et al., 2012; Schindelin et <lb/>al., 2015), which was also used to create overlays. Further data analysis was performed using Python 3 (Python <lb/>Software Foundation, https://www.python.org/, see below for details). <lb/>Image data acquisition -experimental conditions <lb/>Standard procedure. One animal at a time was observed in a 19 x 19 cm Plexiglas tank with a water level of <lb/>0.5 to 1.4 cm (0.5 cm only for the smallest animals, otherwise 1.2 -1.4 cm) at room temperature (20 -24°C). The <lb/>vertical walls (20 cm high) of the tank were surrounded on the outer surface by white paper, and the tank was lit <lb/>from below with four cold light sources placed on either side (ZLED CLS6000, ZETT OPTICS GmbH, Germany) <lb/>or with a light box (Kaiser slimlite LED, Kaiser Fototechnik, Buchen, Germany) that created an evenly lit area of <lb/>46.0 x 20.5 cm. After 1 min adaptation to the environment, a 10 min video sequence was recorded for each of the 92 <lb/>animals. <lb/>Tank size. In addition to the recordings of swimming behaviour in the 19 x 19 cm tank, a group of animals (n = <lb/>9, developmental stages 47 -50) was also tested in a smaller square tank with floor dimensions of 7 x 7 cm. Animals <lb/>were filmed for 10 min in each tank; the order of the tank sizes was small first for half of the tested animals, and <lb/>large first for the other half. All images were acquired with the Point Grey Grasshopper3 camera at 15 fps. <lb/>Alterations in the illumination. To test for a potential influence of vision, a group of animals (n = 10, <lb/>developmental stages 50 -65) were filmed successively with both a white and a black paper surrounding the tank, <lb/>for 10 min each, at a frame rate of 15 fps with the Grasshopper3 camera. The order of black/white was white first for <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>five animals and black first for the other five. A separate group of animals (n = 40, developmental stages 53 -66) <lb/>was filmed for 10 min both under normal light conditions (see above) and with infrared (IR) illumination (IR <lb/>Illuminator, TV6700, EcoLine, 850 nm). Because the IR lights also emitted some red light (visible to a human <lb/>observer), the IR condition most likely was not entirely dark for the animals, but represented a considerably reduced <lb/>light condition. Half of the animals experienced the normal light condition first, whereas the other half started with <lb/>IR illumination. Original IR videos lasted 10.5 min and were reduced afterwards to 10 min by removing the first 30 <lb/>s. The extra 30 s allowed the experimenter to leave the recording room without creating any potentially disturbing <lb/>light during the 10 min test period. <lb/>Convex tank. For the analysis of the swimming behaviour of animals in a convex tank, two of the straight walls <lb/>of the 19 x 19 cm tank were covered with curvatures. Since the number of swimming episodes along the curved <lb/>walls was limited, image acquisition was manually started and stopped. Occasionally, animals were gently touched <lb/>at the tail to stimulate swimming towards the convex curvatures and to redirect the swimming trajectory once the <lb/>animals got arrested in the concave part of the tank. Images were acquired with the Grasshopper3 camera at a frame <lb/>rate of 15 fps. Unlike the remaining data (see below), videos were not automatically tracked but visually inspected <lb/>by the experimenter. A &apos;trial&apos; was considered as an animal following the wall and swimming past a convex curve, <lb/>either following the wall or leaving it. Trials were included independent of the body angles of the animal relative to <lb/>the wall prior to reaching the curve. Trials were excluded if the animal left the wall before reaching the peak of the <lb/>convex curve. The remaining trials were scored as &apos;going straight&apos; if the animal departed from the wall at the curve, <lb/>and as &apos;following the wall&apos; if the animal continued to follow the wall. The proportion of trials in which the animal <lb/>swam straight was then calculated for all animals with at least 4 trials. <lb/>Tracking of swimming trajectories <lb/>Data analysis was carried out by custom-written scripts using Python 3 in the spyder environment <lb/>(https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder, version 2.3.8). The main packages included openCV 3 <lb/>(http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/index.html, version 3.1.0), matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/, version 1.5.1), numpy <lb/>(http://www.numpy.org/, version 1.10.4), pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org/, version 0.18.0) and scipy <lb/>(http://scipy.org/, version 0.17.0). Due to the variety of image file types, image resolution, animal size, illumination <lb/>conditions and compression quality, the strategy for tracking the animal differed between different sets of <lb/>experiments. The main difference was that in some cases, background subtraction was carried out before <lb/>thresholding the image, whereas in other cases images were thresholded directly, either using a simple or a Gaussian <lb/>threshold. <lb/>In contrast, the following steps applied to all cases. The contours of the animals were extracted and the largest <lb/>contour was taken as the animal. X-Y positions were then calculated relative to the tank geometry. This <lb/>transformation was achieved by warping the images to the four corners of the tank, which were manually <lb/>determined. After trajectories were visually inspected, a plot of forward velocity and a video with the animal&apos;s <lb/>position were generated to ensure that the animal was tracked faithfully. Erroneously tracked frames were identified <lb/>by visual inspection and spuriously high forward velocities, and their X-Y coordinates were interpolated. Such <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>corrections were necessary in 36 video sequences, 22 of which were animals in the standard condition, with <lb/>maximally 16 frames to interpolate. In some cases, none of the tracking strategies proved successful, leading to an <lb/>exclusion of 9 animals in the standard condition. <lb/>Further data analysis <lb/>From the X-Y position in the tank-warped images, parameters such as the distance covered during the <lb/>swimming and the distance to the nearest wall were calculated. To avoid including jitter as animal movement, the <lb/>trajectories were simplified with the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm (using the rdp python package, <lb/>https://github.com/fhirschmann/rdp). The epsilon parameter, which determines the degree of simplification, was set <lb/>to 10 in a 900 x 900 pixel video, and was scaled linearly to adjust for changes in the resolution. The simplified <lb/>trajectory was then used to calculate the total distance the animal covered during swimming. Only animals that <lb/>covered a distance of at least one side length of the tank were included in the analysis; in the standard condition, this <lb/>led to the exclusion of four animals. A threshold of 15 mm was chosen to define a &apos;near wall&apos; area, and the <lb/>proportion of time that the animal spent near the wall was calculated. While it is desirable to keep the &apos;near wall&apos; <lb/>threshold as small as possible, 15 mm was chosen to ensure that the tracked centroid of the large animals was still <lb/>within that threshold when the animal was near a wall. With 15 mm, the &apos;near wall&apos; area constituted 29.1% of the 19 <lb/>x 19 cm tank. <lb/>When comparing different tank sizes (7 and 19 cm side length), the animals were compared with a 15 mm <lb/>&apos;near wall&apos; threshold -which might indicate the attractiveness of the wall independent of the size of the tank. <lb/>However, since the &apos;near wall&apos; area in the 7 x 7 cm tank constitutes 67.3% of the whole tank, the distribution of <lb/>distances to the wall in both tanks were normalised to the maximum distance, and a threshold was chosen to define <lb/>the &apos;near wall&apos; area as intermediate in the proportion between the 29.1% and 67.3% that resulted from the 15 mm <lb/>threshold. Therefore, 0.28 of the maximal distance from the wall was chosen as a threshold for defining the &apos;near <lb/>wall&apos; area independent of the tank&apos;s size, yielding a &apos;near wall&apos; area of 48% in both tanks, which was intermediate <lb/>between the &apos;near wall&apos; proportions based on the 15 mm threshold in the two differently sized tanks. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>Swimming trajectories of tadpoles and young adult Xenopus <lb/>The swimming behaviour of animals in a square tank between pre-metamorphic stage 47 (larvae) and post-<lb/>metamorphic stage 66 (froglets) was quantified by monitoring the animals&apos; trajectories over a period of 10 minutes <lb/>in each individual (Fig. 1). Examples of animals at different developmental stages revealed a variety of swimming <lb/>behaviours with respect to the walls of the tank. Independent of developmental stage, some animals exhibited <lb/>trajectories that appeared to cover the entire tank (Fig. 2A-C), while others swam preferentially along the walls of <lb/>the tank (e.g. Fig. 2D,G). To visualise the extent of wall following, the cumulative frequency of distances to the <lb/>nearest wall over the 10 minutes period of swimming was plotted (see Fig. 1B). This graphical presentation is <lb/>equivalent to a histogram of distances to the nearest wall that are summed up along the X-axis. <lb/>The cumulative frequencies of distances to the nearest wall for all animals (n = 79) are shown in Figure 3A. <lb/>The proportion of time that the animals spent near the wall (within 15 mm of the wall) was taken as a measure of the <lb/>strength of wall following. As a group, the 79 animals differed significantly from the proportion that could be <lb/>expected from the &apos;near wall&apos; area (29%, Fig. 3B, Wilcoxon signed rank test, p &lt; 0.0001). Five animals, however, <lb/>spent less than 29% of their time near the wall, which is the proportion of the &apos;near wall&apos; area. Four of these were of <lb/>developmental stage 48 or below and this tied in well with the impression that the strength of wall following <lb/>increased with developmental stage (Fig. 3C, Spearman&apos;s rank correlation between stage and proportion near the <lb/>wall, rho = 0.48, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 79), suggesting that Xenopus larvae/froglets become stronger wall followers during <lb/>ontogeny. <lb/>To reveal potential changes in wall following behaviour in individual animals over the 10 minute test period, <lb/>the respective proportions of time spent near the wall were separately calculated for the four quarters of the <lb/>swimming period (Fig. 3D). Since the proportions of the four quarters were not significantly different from each <lb/>other (Fig. 3B, Friedman test, p = 0.29), the individual wall following strategy of a particular animal persisted over <lb/>the entire test period. Moreover, the total distance covered within the 10 minutes was no confounding factor for wall <lb/>following, since the rank correlation between the total length of the trajectory and the proportion of time spent near <lb/>the wall was not significant (Fig. 3E, Spearman&apos;s rank correlation, rho = 0.03, p = 0.77). <lb/>Role of tentacles in wall following behaviour <lb/>During larval development between stage 51 and 60, Xenopus laevis tadpoles transiently posses a mobile pair <lb/>of rod-like appendages that protrude from the corners of their mouths (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1956). These <lb/>appendages might be necessary or at least advantageous for wall following, given the presence of Merkel cells, <lb/>potentially assigning a tactile function to these tentacles (Ovalle, 1979; Ovalle et al., 1998). However, contrasting <lb/>with normal development, a number of animals from our breeding facility failed to naturally develop noticeable <lb/>tentacles. This allowed to directly test the influence of tentacles on the degree of wall following. Accordingly, the <lb/>swimming behaviour of a population of tadpoles at developmental stages 54 -60 without appendages (n = 11) was <lb/>compared with that of an age-matched group of tadpoles (n = 13) that possessed tentacles with a length of at least 3 <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>mm. <lb/>Statistical analysis of the swimming behaviour as reported above indicated that both populations of animals <lb/>had a similar propensity for wall following (blue and red traces in Fig. 4A). This is demonstrated by the overlapping <lb/>distributions of the cumulative frequencies of distances to the nearest wall in animals with and without tentacles <lb/>(blue and red traces in Fig. 4A). The proportions of time that these animals spent near the wall were not significantly <lb/>different between animals with and without tentacles (Fig. 4B, Mann-Whitney-U test, p = 0.09). If anything, animals <lb/>without tentacles were located closer to the wall than animals with tentacles (see blue and red traces in inset in Fig. <lb/>4A). This likely derives from the fact that the presence of tentacles creates an additional distance of the tadpole with <lb/>respect to the wall that is not present in animals without tentacles. Tentacles are therefore no prerequisite for wall <lb/>following. This, however, does not exclude that tentacles are used as tactile probes; rather it shows that despite the <lb/>absence of tentacles, tadpoles follow the walls of a tank and potentially use facial skin areas as tactile probes. <lb/>Wall following under different luminance conditions <lb/>The wall following of Xenopus larvae/froglets analysed above was further examined during swimming under <lb/>different illumination conditions, which could have facilitated or impaired wall detection. A potential influence of <lb/>the visual system was therefore evaluated in a separate set of experiments where the swimming of stage 50 -65 <lb/>tadpoles/froglets (n = 10) was compared in a tank in which the four walls were covered on the outside by a white or <lb/>a black background (Fig. 5A,B). Analysis of the swimming behaviour indicated that the propensity for wall <lb/>following was not related to the background (Fig. 5B) based on the proportions of time that each animal spent near <lb/>the wall in the two conditions (paired t-test, p = 0.59). This suggests that the visual system exerts no apparent <lb/>influence on the tendency of Xenopus for wall following. This conclusion was confirmed by another set of <lb/>experiments in which the swimming behaviour of tadpoles/froglets (n = 30, stage 53-66) was tested under both <lb/>white light (cold light source) and infrared illumination (850 nm, Fig. 5C,D). Analysis of the proportion of time <lb/>spent near the wall revealed no significant difference between the two conditions (Fig. 5D, paired Wilcoxon signed-<lb/>rank test, p = 0.47), indicating that the reduced light condition during infrared illumination had no effect on wall <lb/>following. <lb/>Influence of tank size on wall following <lb/>Wall following might be influenced by the size of the environment. To test whether the wall is equally <lb/>attractive independent of the size of the tank, animals of developmental stages 47 -50 (n = 9) were tested both in a <lb/>19 x 19 cm and in a 7 x 7 cm tank. The cumulative frequency distributions of distances to the nearest wall suggest <lb/>that the animals spend more time near the wall in the smaller tank (Fig. 6A). This is confirmed by comparing the <lb/>proportion of time that the animals spent near the wall (within 15 mm of the wall) in the two tanks: the proportions <lb/>in the small tank are significantly larger (Fig. 6B, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.0078). This suggests that <lb/>the wall is more attractive in the smaller tank. However, the &apos;near wall&apos; area (within 15 mm of the wall) is also <lb/>relatively larger in the smaller tank (67.3% of the total area in the 7 x 7 cm tank vs. 29.1% of the total area in the 19 <lb/>x 19 cm tank). To compare wall following on the same scale, the distances to the wall were normalised to their <lb/>maximum, and a threshold was chosen that resulted in an intermediate &apos;near wall&apos; area (threshold of 28% of the <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>maximal distance to the wall, resulting in a &apos;near wall&apos; area of 48% of the total tank area; Fig. 6C). The proportion <lb/>of time spent in these area-normalised &apos;near wall&apos; areas was again significantly larger in the smaller tank (Fig. 6D, <lb/>paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.0078). The animals are therefore stronger wall followers in the smaller tank <lb/>also when taking into account the differences in area. <lb/>Wall following is passive <lb/>Wall following might be either active such as in blind cavefish (Patton et al., 2010) or passive (distinction <lb/>according to Creed and Miller, 1990). To distinguish between the two possibilities for wall following in larval and <lb/>adult Xenopus, the swimming behaviour was tested in a specifically designed tank (Fig. 7A,B). The use of a tank in <lb/>which two of the four walls had convex curvatures allowed testing if tadpoles seek wall touch during swimming <lb/>actively or follow concave walls passively (red and blue arrows in Fig. 7A). The proportion of trials when animals <lb/>swam straight after encountering a convex curve (Fig. 7B) was evaluated from visual inspection by the <lb/>experimenter. The majority of tested tadpoles swam straight in all trials (Fig. 7B) more or less independent of their <lb/>developmental stage (Fig. 7C,D, n = 22), leading to the conclusion that wall following in Xenopus is passive. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Xenopus laevis -from small tadpoles to froglets -tend to follow the wall when swimming in a square tank. <lb/>The strength of wall following increases with progressive development and smaller tank size and is not confounded <lb/>by the total distance that an animal covers. The transient presence of mechanosensory tentacles at mid-larval stages <lb/>does not lead to stronger wall following compared to animals that naturally do not develop these appendages. Also, <lb/>vision is unlikely a main driver of wall following, as surrounding the tank by black or white paper or changing the <lb/>light to infrared illumination does not change the strength of wall following. Wall following is passive as indicated <lb/>by straight swimming in a tank with convex curvatures. This indicates that wall following in Xenopus is likely <lb/>imposed by the concave environment. Wall following being passive might also explain why it persists across <lb/>metamorphosis and is present in both tadpoles and froglets, independent of their very different locomotor styles. <lb/>Classification and different types of wall following <lb/>Wall following in concave environments has been described for a wide variety of animals: from <lb/>crustaceans such as crayfish (Basil and Sandeman, 1999) to insects such as Drosophila (Besson and Martin, 2005; <lb/>Martin, 2004), or cockroaches (Camhi and Johnson, 1999; Jeanson et al., 2003; Okada and Toh, 2000), to fishes <lb/>such as zebrafish (Anichtchik et al., 2004; Colwill and Creton, 2011), goldfish (Kato et al., 1996), salmon (Clements <lb/>et al., 2002) or blind cavefish (Patton et al., 2010; Teyke, 1985; Teyke, 1989), to several rodent species including <lb/>voles, rats and mice (Eilam, 2004; Perrot-Sinal et al., 1999; Simon et al., 1994; Treit and Fundytus, 1988; Webster et <lb/>al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1976). In many cases, these examples of wall following behaviours have been described in <lb/>the context of thigmotaxis and centrophobism, and in relation to the level of anxiety. Thigmotaxis is a term that <lb/>describes the motion of an organism relative to a touch stimulus; it is often used as shorthand for positive <lb/>thigmotaxis, which means that animals actively seek out touch stimulation as they move. Centrophobism, on the <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>other hand, is a tendency of animals to avoid open spaces, for instance the centre of an open test field for mice or <lb/>rats (Martínez et al., 2002). Some authors use the term centrophobism when the avoidance of open spaces is related <lb/>to vision (Cardenas et al., 2001). For instance common spiny mice move much more often into an open space in the <lb/>dark than in the light (Eilam, 2004), though some authors use the term centrophobism without necessarily implying <lb/>a visual mechanism. Thus, centrophobism and thigmotaxis are two potential but not mutually exclusive mechanisms <lb/>that can lead to the avoidance of open spaces and the following of environmental boundaries. Wall following is <lb/>therefore a neutral term to describe the tendency of an animal to follow vertical walls in its environment without a <lb/>reference to the underlying mechanism. An environment with convex borders allows distinguishing between passive <lb/>and active wall following (Creed and Miller, 1990). Animals perform active wall following when voluntarily <lb/>seeking out the proximity to a wall and turn in order to remain near the wall. Passive wall following occurs when <lb/>animals leave the wall at a convex curve but follow the walls in a concave environment. When wall following is <lb/>active, thigmotaxis, centrophobism or a combination of the two can be the underlying mechanism. <lb/>Potential uses of wall following <lb/>Thigmotaxis has been described both as a defensive strategy (Grossen and Kelley, 1972) as well as a spatial <lb/>exploration strategy (Kallai et al., 2007). Animals might be safer near a vertical wall compared to the open; for <lb/>instance it has been suggested that avian predation on rats likely is lower near a wall than in the open (Grossen and <lb/>Kelley, 1972). Mice increase thigmotaxis in the presence of a potential predator (Bonsignore et al., 2008). Other <lb/>rodents such as the common spiny mouse only venture in the centre of an open field if there are objects that might <lb/>serve as shelter, or if it is dark (Eilam, 2004). Moreover, thigmotaxis has been related to anxiety, and is commonly <lb/>used as a simple behavioural readout of anxiety levels in mice and rats (Prut and Belzung, 2003; Simon et al., 1994; <lb/>Treit and Fundytus, 1988). Some authors argue that fear of open spaces is not only driven by touch but also by <lb/>vision (Martínez et al., 2002), which suggests that wall hugging and avoidance of open spaces is a combination of <lb/>thigmotaxis and centrophobism. Independent of the underlying mechanisms, the use as a defensive strategy is clear. <lb/>Moreover, wall following can also serve as a useful spatial exploration strategy. Especially under conditions when <lb/>long-range sensing such as vision is not available, exploration of the environment based on touch along its borders <lb/>can provide the basis for the formation of a cognitive map (Kallai et al., 2007; Yaski et al., 2009) and serve as a <lb/>reference frame for later exploration (Kallai et al., 2005). However, this is only useful as an initial strategy; if it is <lb/>used excessively it can even prevent further spatial learning (Kallai et al., 2007). Such initial wall following as a <lb/>means for spatial learning has been observed in various species such as crayfish (Basil and Sandeman, 1999), blind <lb/>cavefish (Teyke, 1989), and blind mole rats (Avni et al., 2008). <lb/>Persistence of wall following with development in Xenopus <lb/>In this study we examined a range of developmental stages of Xenopus -from small to large tadpoles <lb/>immediately prior to metamorphosis as well as froglets after metamorphosis has been completed. Wall following in <lb/>a square tank was present at all developmental stages; the strength of wall following was weakest, however, in the <lb/>smallest tadpoles, stronger, with considerable variations in larger tadpoles and consistently strong in froglets. This <lb/>persistence suggests that wall following is not a behavioural strategy only employed by tadpoles or frogs, and is not <lb/></body>

			<body>linked to a particular locomotor style such as undulatory tail-based propulsion or leg-based swimming. Moreover, <lb/>wall following in a convex tank was passive in all animals tested (see below). The weaker wall following in young <lb/>larvae is noticeable and might be related to the somewhat different swimming style of these animals (see Fig. 3A in <lb/>Hänzi and Straka, 2017), where the rotation axis of the left-right head undulations oscillates between positions <lb/>outside the animal; this is at variance with the situation in larger tadpoles where the head oscillations during <lb/>swimming occur around a single central axis (Lambert et al., 2009). This difference in swimming style might <lb/>facilitate turns away from a vertical wall in young larvae and explain the weaker wall following. <lb/>At intermediate developmental stages examined in this study (stage 51-60 according to Nieuwkoop and <lb/>Faber, (1956)), tadpoles normally possess a pair of mobile appendages protruding from the corners of their mouths, <lb/>which are retracted during undulatory swimming (Hänzi et al., 2015). These tentacles -like other skin areas -<lb/>possess mechanoreceptive Merkel cells (Nurse et al., 1983; Ovalle, 1979; Ovalle et al., 1998), and therefore the <lb/>tentacles likely serve a tactile function when the animal is stationary or cruising slowly with tentacles extended <lb/>forward. We hypothesised that these tentacles might be used to explore the environment in a way that is similar to <lb/>rodents&apos; whiskers but simpler because the structure is not as specialised. However, younger larvae and older animals <lb/>at metamorphic climax (&gt;stage 61) that do not possess any tentacles were overall similar in their wall following <lb/>tendencies, as were animals that for unknown reasons did not develop tentacles (Fig. 4). While this does not exclude <lb/>that -when present -tentacles are used for tactile exploration, it shows at least that tentacles are not necessary for <lb/>wall following, and if tactile exploration is needed, tadpoles might also use their facial skin. <lb/>Effects of vision <lb/>As mentioned above, some rodents leave the walls and venture much more into open space in darkness than <lb/>in light; this is true not only for the common spiny mouse (Eilam, 2004) but also for rats (Nasello et al., 1998), some <lb/>types of gerbil (Zadicario et al., 2005) and wild-caught prairie deer mice (Brillahart and Kaufman, 1991). Some <lb/>rodents also adjust their foraging behaviour in laboratory or natural conditions such that they venture more into the <lb/>open in the dark (Diaz, 1992; Price et al., 1984; Vasquez, 1996), and some authors also assign a role of vision in the <lb/>avoidance of open spaces by rats (Cardenas et al., 2001; Martínez et al., 2002). However, tadpoles and froglets of <lb/>Xenopus laevis did not show stronger wall following in light than under infrared illumination. While the IR lamps <lb/>used here did not produce pure infrared light, IR illumination nevertheless is a condition with considerably reduced <lb/>light and influence of vision. Centrophobism or visually driven fear of open spaces is therefore very unlikely to be <lb/>the driving force behind wall following in Xenopus. The wall following strategy might rather be a side effect of <lb/>locomotion in the mostly murky aquatic environment of the natural habitat of Xenopus (Nieuwkoop and Faber, <lb/>1956) independent of the developmental stage. <lb/>Effects of the size of the environment <lb/>A range of different arena sizes have been used in rodent open field tests (Walsh and Cummins, 1976), and <lb/>the geometry of the environment has shown to influence path shapes of rats not only at the perimeter but also at the <lb/>centre of an environment (Yaski et al., 2011). A wall can exert both a guiding and attracting influence on mouse <lb/>behaviour from quite some distance (Horev et al., 2007). Two studies explicitly examined the proportion of time that <lb/></body>

			<body>social voles spend near the wall in arenas of different sizes (Eilam, 2003; Eilam et al., 2003). These animals are very <lb/>active, and spend more time near the wall in larger arenas -possibly because the larger open space is perceived as <lb/>more dangerous than a smaller, more enclosed open space. This contrasts with the behaviour of Xenopus described <lb/>here, which are stronger wall followers in smaller tanks. It therefore seems likely that wall following in Xenopus is <lb/>imposed by the constraints of the environment, whereas wall following in social voles serves as a defensive strategy. <lb/>Moreover, thigmotaxis is unlikely to be the main mechanism behind wall following in either of the two cases, since <lb/>different tank/arena sizes would have no impact on wall following if thigmotaxis was the underlying cause (Eilam et <lb/>al., 2003) -with thigmotaxis as the main mechanism, the walls would be equally attractive independent of the arena <lb/>size. <lb/>Passive versus active wall following <lb/>The studies ascribing protection or exploration as the function of wall following have used the terms <lb/>thigmotaxis or centrophobism for a reason: wall following can only be protective or exploratory if it is active. <lb/>Passive wall following such as observed in this study in Xenopus laevis is rather unlikely to serve these purposes. To <lb/>the best of our knowledge, no other study described passive wall following so far. Potential reasons include that only <lb/>few studies use convex tanks, and that passive wall following might be considered a negative finding and not be <lb/>reported. The few following studies did use convex enclosures to discriminate active from passive wall following: <lb/>In blind cavefish, for instance, wall following is clearly active (Patton et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2009). These <lb/>animals are blind, live in dark caves and use their lateral line system as a near range sense to obtain information <lb/>about their environment. In a convex tank they actively follow the wall because they would not be able to orient <lb/>otherwise. Adult fruit flies, on the other hand, leave the wall in more than 50% of the trials; their preference for <lb/>walls in circular arenas seems to derive from a preference for the boundaries of the environment rather than from <lb/>thigmotaxis or centrophobism (Soibam et al., 2012). In contrast to fruit flies, cockroaches have antennae that can be <lb/>longer than their body (Camhi and Johnson, 1999). These animals use these mechanoreceptive sensors to gain <lb/>information about their nearby environment. Cockroaches thus have been described as thigmotactic in concave <lb/>environments (Camhi and Johnson, 1999; Jeanson et al., 2003) and show positive thigmotaxis towards objects that <lb/>are touched by the antennae (Okada and Toh, 2000). When running along a wall these animals constantly touch the <lb/>wall with one of their antennae (Camhi and Johnson, 1999). However, when arriving at a convex curve, they leave <lb/>the curve in about 50% of the trials (Creed and Miller, 1990). <lb/>Active wall following in blind cavefish certainly serves as a spatial exploration and spatial learning strategy <lb/>(Teyke, 1989), and to a certain extent this might also be true for cockroaches or fruit flies. In contrast, wall <lb/>following in Xenopus laevis is passive and therefore unlikely to serve as a specific protective or exploratory strategy <lb/>or a behaviour that is related to anxiety. A number of factors potentially influencing wall following such as changes <lb/>in illumination or the presence of tentacles were shown to play no major role for wall following in Xenopus. Instead, <lb/>passive wall following in these animals might be due to the particularity of the rather unnatural and concave test <lb/>environment. This thus suggests that spatially more complex and natural environments likely would yield richer <lb/>behaviours (see also Benjamini et al., 2010; Cheng, 2005). <lb/></body>
