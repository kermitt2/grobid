			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>In recent years it has become increasingly evident that studying the tumor microenvironment <lb/>(TME), in addition to studying cancer cell transformation, is crucial to understanding tumor <lb/>growth, progression and dissemination. TME is a complex and heterogeneous milieu where <lb/>cancer cells and stromal cells (including immune cells and other cells resident in the tissue) <lb/>interact with each other and with the extracellular matrix (ECM), Figure 1. One of the <lb/>critical elements of the TME is the tumor&apos;s interaction with the host immune system. <lb/>Hanahan and Weinberg described evasion of the immune system as one of the hallmarks of <lb/>cancer [1]. The importance of the stromal microenvironment in tumor progression was also <lb/>recognized in the classical paper by Paget [2]. It has become clear that the tumor stromal <lb/>component, and specifically, the host immune system, contributes to tumor growth, and new <lb/>therapeutics are now being aimed at altering the immune system as a cancer target (see <lb/>reviews [3,4]). <lb/>The cellular components of the TME can vary in different regions of the tumor [5], as well <lb/>as between patients and even between tumors in a single patient [6]. Each of these cellular <lb/>components has its own behavior in terms of migration, proliferation, differentiation, <lb/>apoptosis, adhesion, and response to treatment. Cancer is so difficult to treat partly because <lb/>of this degree of complexity that results in a highly unpredictable tumor behavior, partially <lb/>due to the complex microenvironment [7], emphasizing the pressing need for personalized <lb/>treatment for individual patients. Mathematical and computational modeling techniques <lb/>provide a powerful tool in understanding the TME and predicting cancer progression [8]. <lb/>Below, we provide a brief overview of the role of the immune system in cancer and <lb/>introduce computational approaches to study the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). <lb/>2. Immune System Biology and Cancer <lb/>The immune system consists of two major parts: the innate immune system, and the adaptive <lb/>immune system. The innate immune system is the body&apos;s immediate defense against foreign <lb/>antigens. The immunity via the innate immune system is nonspecific and short-lived, <lb/>whereas the adaptive immune response is a late-stage immune response that is highly <lb/>specific and can provide long-lasting defense [9]. The innate immune cells have pattern <lb/>recognition receptors that recognize entities that are non-self and then induce an <lb/>inflammatory response. The innate immune response is immediate, although some studies <lb/>suggest these cells also have the capability for memory [10], and may be followed by an <lb/>adaptive immune response [11]. The adaptive immune response is more specific than the <lb/>innate immune response and can be antibody-mediated or cell-mediated, with T-and B-cells <lb/>as the key cell types driving this response [12]. T-cells are a type of lymphocyte that matures <lb/>in the thymus, with several different subtypes that play a distinct function in immune <lb/>response [13]. Cytotoxic T-cells kill cancer cells [13], T-helper cells assist other cell types <lb/>during the immune response, and T-regulatory cells (Treg) play an important role in <lb/>immunological tolerance. In the case of cancer, in addition to normal antigens (self), cancer <lb/>cells express antigens unique to the tumor, which can result in an immune response. The <lb/>computational models discussed in this review will largely focus on the adaptive immune <lb/>system. <lb/></body>

			<body>Although the immune system is well equipped to eliminate abnormal cells, cancer cells have <lb/>several ways to evade the immune system. For example, cancer cells can become invisible to <lb/>the immune system by downregulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I <lb/>receptors on their cell surface, and in turn, not presenting the mutation associated antigen for <lb/>detection by T-cell receptors. Cancer cells attract regulatory T-cells (Treg) [14] and myeloid-<lb/>derived suppressor cells (MDSC) [15] to the tumors; an abundance of these cell types results <lb/>in an immunosuppressive environment [16]. Furthermore, receptors such as CTLA-4 on <lb/>Treg can bind to CD80 and CD86 on T-cells and antigen presenting cells (APC), which <lb/>inhibits co-stimulation of these cells, and results in T-cell suppression. Treg can further <lb/>inhibit the adaptive immune response by interfering with B-cell function and releasing <lb/>immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10. In fact, under certain conditions, the immune <lb/>response can contribute to tumor growth instead of inhibiting it [17]. Another way that <lb/>tumors escape detection is through chronic inflammation [18]. During chronic inflammation, <lb/>T-cells eventually lose their effectiveness over the course of the infection, called T-cell <lb/>exhaustion [19]. T-cell exhaustion is also frequently found in the tumor microenvironment <lb/>through the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway [20]. PD-1 blockage enhances T-cell and NK (Natural <lb/>Killer) cell activity in tumors [21,22]. Several immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently <lb/>being used in treatments of patients with cancer [23,24]. <lb/>Innate immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils, have also been <lb/>shown to decrease or enhance tumor growth depending on their polarization state. <lb/>Macrophages have a great deal of plasticity but are usually classified in one of two types: an <lb/>M1-type that is immuno-enhancing, and an M2-type which is immuno-suppressing; though <lb/>there is a spectrum of states between M1 and M2 [25]. Studies have shown that high <lb/>numbers of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can lead to a worse clinical outcome [26]. <lb/>TAM have been shown to promote tumor growth by increasing vascularization, cancer cell <lb/>migration, cancer cell survival, and immuno-suppression [27]. Macrophages are recruited to <lb/>hypoxic areas of the tumor [28], and aid in tumor progression [26,29]. Cancer cells recruit <lb/>macrophages through Colony Stimulating Factor 1 (CSF1), and high CSF1 concentrations <lb/>are correlated with poor prognoses [30]. Macrophages can be converted to TAM within the <lb/>tumor by secreted factors, such as c-c chemokine receptor type-2 (CCR2) [31], which causes <lb/>them to exhibit an M2-like phenotype [32]; this conversion of macrophages leads to a <lb/>distinct subpopulation [33]. TAM secretion of c-c chemokine ligand type-18 (CCL18) can <lb/>enable the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells [34,35]. These TAM <lb/>have also been shown to be associated with invasion, extravasation and metastasis [36-38]. <lb/>Thus, M2-type macrophages are currently being targeted with therapeutics for tumor <lb/>treatment [39]. Neutrophils are less abundant in tumors, but they are becoming more <lb/>recognized for their duel role in the immune response to cancer [40]. Eosinophils are also <lb/>commonly found within tumors [41], and have been found to enhance T-cell infiltration [42]. <lb/>These cells also have a duel role in the immune response, and can promote or suppress <lb/>tumor growth [43]. There is a complex interaction between cancer cells and the immune <lb/>system. Thus, it is important to understand the conditions in which tumors are eliminated or <lb/>enhanced by the immune system. <lb/>As is evident from the complex mechanisms of immune response and immune evasion <lb/>described above, modeling the immune system is a challenging task [44]. For the specific <lb/></body>

			<body>case of cancer, immune cells can be found within the TME, the lymphatic system and the <lb/>lymph nodes, resulting in spatial complexity. Molecular and cellular components themselves <lb/>are complex and have patient specific features such as unique lymphocyte antigen receptors. <lb/>In addition, different functions of the immune system occur at different time scales, ranging <lb/>from minutes to years. For example, intracellular signaling occurs in minutes, whereas <lb/>memory cells exist on the order of years. Revealing this complexity across different scales as <lb/>discussed above is very challenging or impossible to achieve in an experimental setting. <lb/>Thus, computational modeling platforms provide a powerful tool to complement <lb/>experimental measurements for better understanding of the immune system in cancer. In the <lb/>following section, we provide an overview of the current computational modeling <lb/>approaches for the study of cancer. <lb/>3. Overview of Computational Modeling Methodologies including Agent-<lb/>Based Modeling <lb/>Computational modeling has provided great insight into studying intra-tumor heterogeneity <lb/>[45] and the interplay between the tumor and the microenvironment [46]. Modeling has the <lb/>benefit of providing a quantitative time-and cost-effective means to study the physical and <lb/>chemical interactions in tumor initiation and growth. Modeling efforts complement <lb/>experimental platforms by providing an understanding of clonal dynamics and <lb/>microenvironmental cues over time. There are several ways to classify mathematical/ <lb/>computational models in general, and cancer models in particular. One is deterministic vs. <lb/>stochastic; another is continuum vs. discrete models. Deterministic models have an end state <lb/>that does not change as long as the initial conditions remain the same, whereas stochastic <lb/>models have randomness included, resulting in differences in end states, even with the same <lb/>initial conditions. Continuum models treat cells as concentrations of cell types, whereas <lb/>discrete models (such as agent-based or particle models) consider discrete cells; the cell <lb/>behaviors, including interactions between cells, can be described as deterministic or <lb/>stochastic. A multiscale setting (called a hybrid model, illustrated in Figure 2) can include <lb/>both approaches, i.e., the discrete modeling of cells and continuous modeling of molecular <lb/>species, such as oxygen, growth factors, chemokines, microRNAs, and drugs, but <lb/>appropriate linking and calibration of such hybrid models should be performed. For <lb/>continuum-based models, temporal ordinary differential equations (ODE) and spatio-<lb/>temporal partial differential equations (PDE) have been used to model the immune response <lb/>in cancer, e.g., [47-53]; here, we focus on discrete agent-based models (ABM) and hybrid <lb/>models. <lb/>From another standpoint, the models that describe the immune system can be broadly <lb/>categorized into top-down and bottom-up, and previous reviews have focused on <lb/>computational modeling of the immune system [44,54]. The top-down approach models <lb/>populations of cells, not single entities, and uses the mean behavior at the macroscopic level. <lb/>ODE and PDE models are examples of this type of modeling where individual interactions <lb/>are not simulated. Stochastic differential equation models are also a part of this class. On the <lb/>other hand, the bottom-up approach focuses on the microscopic level. The model tracks each <lb/>agent (e.g., a cell) and its interactions with the surrounding environment, and emergent <lb/></body>

			<body>behavior arises from all the entities and their local behavior. Features such as stochastic <lb/>behavior, spatial distribution, and heterogeneity of entities are inherent to bottom up models, <lb/>and thus, easier to capture with this approach. Drawbacks of these models are that they <lb/>require more computational power because they track individual agents and their <lb/>interactions over time and space; also, there are computational limitations on the number of <lb/>agents that can be considered; it is thus impossible to consider an entire organ or patient. <lb/>Therefore, both approaches will need to be combined to achieve both spatial cellular and <lb/>sub-cellular resolutions and whole patient pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. <lb/>Agent-based models are an example of a bottom-up approach with applications in <lb/>immunology and immune related diseases such as cancer [55]. An agent-based model is a <lb/>discrete mathematical and computational framework that is capable of capturing emergent <lb/>behavior of its interacting agents, defined as large-scale spatio-temperal patterns resulting <lb/>from local spatial interactions between agents. The behavior and function of these agents are <lb/>driven by the information they sense in their local environment and the rules of the agent-<lb/>based model. Some of the characteristics that separate agent-based models apart from other <lb/>rule-based modeling systems (in which outcomes are based on a set of rules that govern <lb/>decisions) are that (1) they are spatial, (2) they incorporate agents that interact with other <lb/>agents and their environment, (3) they may incorporate stochasticity, (4) they are modular, <lb/>and (5) they produce emergent behavior [56]. These models allow the individual agents to <lb/>adapt to their local environment (i.e., agents are adaptive instead of reactive), and take part <lb/>in local interactions with other agents [57]. These result in complex aggregate behavior <lb/>stemming from simple rules and emergent properties from agent interactions. Agent-based <lb/>models can be lattice-based or lattice-free, depending on whether agents reside and move on <lb/>a (regular or irregular) spatially discretized lattice, or have their locations and velocities <lb/>represented by continuous variables, usually governed by forces in the environment. For <lb/>example, in lattice-based ABM, agents are placed on a lattice structure that defines the <lb/>locations of cells and their neighbors for cellular interactions. There are several model types <lb/>that, although they are not explicitly characterized as agent-based, are reviewed here for <lb/>completeness; those include cellular automata, Potts models, and Petri net models. <lb/>Agent-based models are particularly suitable for capturing spatially-varying events and <lb/>heterogeneities [58], and for understanding the immune system&apos;s function. With this aim in <lb/>mind, several investigators have developed agent-based models of diseases with involvement <lb/>of the immune system. Several ABM have simulated the immune system&apos;s involvement in <lb/>maintaining homeostasis and disease conditions, such as bacterial infections [59], fungal <lb/>infections [60], abnormal systemic inflammatory response [61], ulceration [62], allergens <lb/>[63], ischemia [64], tuberculosis [65], sepsis [66], and wound healing [67]. For cancers, such <lb/>models include tumor growth and invasion [68], as well as specific cancer types such as <lb/>hepatocellular carcinoma [69], breast cancer [70], melanoma [71], colorectal [72], lung <lb/>cancer [73,74], and metastasis [75]. Software packages have been developed based on the <lb/>ABM framework to study the immune system; these include ImmSim [76-79], Immunogrid <lb/>[80,81], Simmune [82], Cycell [83], and PhysiCell [84]. <lb/>Now we discuss the latest agent-based and hybrid models that investigate the effects of the <lb/>immune system on cancer progression and immunotherapy, see Table 1.

			<body>included in the review, the work needs to have an immune component, a tumor component, <lb/>and include ABM. We limited our focus to papers that were published within the last ten <lb/>years. However, we also included some studies on diseases other than cancer where we feel <lb/>that the methodology is relevant and could be applied to cancer; we also refer to a few <lb/>general software tools that can be readily adapted to cancer. <lb/>We break the review into the following sections, although there may be significant overlap: <lb/>(1) <lb/>Models focusing on immune-related tumor mechanobiology <lb/>(2) <lb/>Models focusing on tumor-associated vasculature in the immune response <lb/>(3) <lb/>Models focusing on tumor-associated lymphatics and lymph nodes <lb/>(4) <lb/>Models focusing on tumor immunotherapy <lb/>(5) <lb/>Models focusing on tumor-enhancing immune cells <lb/>(6) <lb/>Models focusing on intra-tumor heterogeneity <lb/>3.1. Models Focusing on Tumor Mechanobiology <lb/>Changes in the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) have been known to contribute to tumor <lb/>progression and metastasis [85], with several computational models focusing on <lb/>investigating glioma invasion [86-88], but less is known about its contribution to immune <lb/>response. Computational modeling has been used to shed light on the interactions between <lb/>the ECM and the immune system in cancer dynamics. A hybrid agent-based model was used <lb/>to investigate the role of cellular adhesion to the ECM in tumor and immune system <lb/>dynamics [89]. Frascoli et al. found that the greater the motility of the cancer cells, the more <lb/>likely they will escape from immunotherapy. They also found that intermediate levels of <lb/>adhesion in general led to less successful outcomes, but these results were variable. <lb/>Kather et al. used ABM to investigate the combination of adoptive cell transfer and therapy <lb/>that permeabilized the fibrotic stromal component in colorectal cancer [72]. Adoptive cell <lb/>transfer is a therapeutic strategy that aims to increase the number of immune cells to <lb/>strengthen immuno-surveillance and counter tumor development. Kather et al. simulated <lb/>various conditions of immune surveillance. In their model, T-cell killing of tumor cells <lb/>occurred in a purely stochastic manner, with killing probability representing the effect of <lb/>tumor specificity, immunogenicity, stimulatory and inhibitory effects all in one parameter. <lb/>An immune rich environment promoted immune escape, but tumor growth slowed in a <lb/>lymphocyte deprived environment. Tumor control was observed in a subgroup of tumors <lb/>with less stroma and a high numbers of immune cells. They found that high levels of fibrosis <lb/>and low numbers of lymphocytes reduced overall survival. Their findings were validated <lb/>with data from colorectal cancer patients, where low density stroma and high lymphocyte <lb/>level correlated with better overall survival. In this study, Kather et al. simulated the effect of <lb/>immunotherapy by boosting the number of immune cells by 2-8 fold. Therapy was intended <lb/>to enhance fibrotic stromal permeability; this was implemented by modifying the <lb/>corresponding parameter by a factor of 4% to 16%. The model predicted that optimal tumor <lb/>eradication requires a combination of therapeutics aiming at both activating adaptive <lb/>immune system and stromal depletion. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2. Models Focusing on Tumor-Associated Vasculature in the Immune Response <lb/>Tumor-associated vasculature is an important aspect of the tumor-immune complex because <lb/>it not only provides oxygen and nutrients for the tumor to grow, but it is also the source of <lb/>tumor dissemination via circulating tumor cells (CTC), and recruitment for many immune <lb/>cells, such as monocytes/macrophages and T-cells. Studies have aimed to provide a better <lb/>understanding of these processes [90,91]. An ABM of Early Metastasis (ABMEM) <lb/>framework was used to model the interactions between tumor cells, platelets, neutrophils, <lb/>and endothelial cells [92]. Receptor binding to Mac-1 (macrophage antigen-1) by <lb/>endothelial cells, platelets, or tumor cells leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production <lb/>by neutrophils. Uppal et al. examined two types of platelet inhibition: inhibition of <lb/>thromboxane, inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptors and inhibition of both <lb/>[92]. They found that thromboxane inhibition alone resulted in the best outcome. <lb/>Alfonso et al. developed an agent-based model of immune cell-epithelial cell interactions in <lb/>breast lobular epithelium [93]. The model investigated the effect of menstrual cycle length <lb/>and hormone status on inflammatory response to cell turnover in breast tissue. Blood vessels <lb/>were homogeneously distributed in the intra-and interlobular stroma. The model accounts <lb/>for myoepithelial and luminal cells. Cellular processes (i.e., epithelial cell proliferation, cell <lb/>death via effector cells, programmed cell death, removal of dead cells, immune cell motility, <lb/>and inhibition of effector cells by regulatory cells) are modeled as stochastic events. Effector <lb/>CD8+ cells are the only cells responsible for killing of damaged epithelial cells. Regulatory <lb/>CD4+ and CD8+ cells act by inducing inactivation of effector dependent response. <lb/>Chemokines from damaged epithelial cells activate the immune cells. Immune cells become <lb/>ineffective when such chemokines are absent, or due to the suppression via regulatory cells. <lb/>The outcome of the model identified novel prognostic information for breast cancer, such as <lb/>the number of immune clusters being associated with the degree of epithelial damage. <lb/>3.3. Models Focusing on Tumor-Associated Lymphatics and Lymph Nodes <lb/>Reddy developed the first mathematical model of the lymphatic system in 1977 [94]. In <lb/>recent years, various computational modeling approaches have been used to study the <lb/>lymphatic vessels [95-99] and lymph nodes [100-102] in general, and in the application to <lb/>infectious disease [103,104], and simulating fluid and chemokine transport in the lymphatic <lb/>system as it relates to health and disease conditions [105]. Agent-based models have more <lb/>recently been used to simulate various processes that occur during an adaptive immune <lb/>response in a lymph node. Meyer-Hermann developed an ABM of germinal centers of the <lb/>lymph node [106,107]. The authors studied B-cell germinal center reactions and how they <lb/>contribute to germinal center deregulation [106]. They expanded this model to study B-cell <lb/>affinity maturation in the lymph node germinal centers [108]. They found that competition <lb/>for T-cell rescue and increased refractory time leads to a more robust affinity maturation. <lb/>A series of studies on modeling of T-cell behavior in the lymph node have been conducted <lb/>by Bogle and Dunbar [44,109-112]. They modeled T-cell trafficking, activation, and <lb/>proliferation in the lymph node paracortex using an agent-based approach. The model <lb/>included chemokine and cytokine gradients. Using this lattice-based approach, they were <lb/>able to model the movement and behavior of T-cells in the lymph node paracortex [112]. In <lb/></body>

			<body>the next step, they expanded the agent-based model of the lymph node paracortex in three <lb/>dimensions to include T-cells and dendritic cells (DC). The model allows simulation of a <lb/>large number of T-cells at physiologic densities. The virtual lymph node can shrink or swell, <lb/>depending on the dynamics of cell trafficking. The model was able to simulate T-cell <lb/>activation in agreement with in-vivo observations, and provide new understanding on T-cell-<lb/>DC interactions. Not all the parameters of the model were experimentally measured; thus, <lb/>the model can be refined by more accurate measurement of those parameters [110]. Next, <lb/>the authors built on their previous models to simulate T-cell ingress and egress, as well as <lb/>chemotaxis in the lymph node, by incorporating new numerical methods. The new model <lb/>allows simulation of expansion and contraction of T-cells in the lymph node paracortex <lb/>during an immune response. The ability to model chemotaxis could be useful in studying <lb/>other biological processes involving chemotaxis [111]. <lb/>Moreau et al. constructed a virtual lymph node using agent-based modeling to study T-cell <lb/>activation by synapses (long-lasting contacts) and kinapses (transient interactions) [113]. <lb/>The model incorporated T-cell migration and T-cell-DC interactions. Additionally, virtual <lb/>fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACs) profiles were obtained from modeling by <lb/>visualizing T-cell proliferation. This virtual lymph node model provides new opportunities <lb/>for understanding the mechanisms of T-cell regulation in infection or vaccine application <lb/>[113]. <lb/>The ABM developed for studies of the lymphatic system thus far mainly focus on the lymph <lb/>node, and in particular, T-cell processes. Folcik et al. developed the basic immune simulator <lb/>(BIS), which is an agent-based platform that includes parenchymal tissue, secondary <lb/>lymphoid tissue and the lymphatic/humoral circulation [114]. Using agent-based and hybrid <lb/>models, lymph node dynamics are studied in the context of infectious diseases and cancer. <lb/>Kim and Lee used a hybrid model to study the efficacy of preventative cancer vaccines. The <lb/>model comprised two compartments for interactions of tumor and immune cells at the tissue <lb/>site and in the draining lymph nodes [115]. Jacob et al. developed a three-compartment <lb/>ABM that includes lymph nodes, blood vessels, and organ/tissue. The model was used to <lb/>study immune response against viruses in these compartments [116]. Marino et al. <lb/>developed a hybrid model where the lymph node and blood compartment were simulated <lb/>using ordinary differential equations and the lung compartment was simulated using agents. <lb/>They focused on the formation of granulomas in the lung, which are organized structures of <lb/>immune cells in the lung, and are a hallmark of infection. The model focused on the <lb/>recruitment of APCs in the lymph node from the lung for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, <lb/>the causative bacterium of TB) infection [117]. In another study, they investigated the role of <lb/>DC in Mtb infection [118]. The growth and dissemination of bacteria were highly affected <lb/>by CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell proliferation rates and DC migration. Such multiscale models <lb/>allow the study of tissue level dynamics during adaptive immune response [118], and <lb/>although they focus on infectious disease, many of the components and processes involved <lb/>in anti-cancer immunity and adaptive immunity against infection are shared. For example, T-<lb/>cells specific to tumor antigens are primed and expanded in a similar fashion to that in which <lb/>T-cells specific to foreign antigens are during their response to infection; the immune <lb/>suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells hijack to evade immune surveillance are also <lb/>deployed during an immune response against infection to prevent excessive tissue damage. <lb/></body>

			<body>Since the body reacts similarly in response to an infection as it does in response to cancer <lb/>(e.g., activation of similar signaling pathways), cancer models can heavily borrow from this <lb/>literature. <lb/>3.4. Models Focusing on Tumor Immunotherapy <lb/>A variety of cancer immunotherapy strategies exist that range from boosting the overall <lb/>immune response to specifically targeting cancer immunity. Some examples of <lb/>immunotherapies are treatment vaccines, adoptive cell transfer, and immune checkpoint <lb/>inhibitor treatments. Agent-based and hybrid models are developed to help understand these <lb/>therapies when applied separately or in combination with other cancer treatments. One type <lb/>of therapy that has been explored is cancer vaccines. Therapeutic cancer vaccines treat <lb/>existing cancers by delivering immunogenic and tumor specific antigens to the patient to <lb/>induce cellular and/or humoral anti-tumor immunity. Pennisi et al. have developed several <lb/>hybrid models investigating the immune system effects on tumors. They developed a hybrid <lb/>model to study the development of lung metastases from mammary carcinoma [75]. Pennisi <lb/>et al. also developed a hybrid model MetastaSim to simulate the protection against lung <lb/>metastases in mouse using Triplex cell vaccine [73]. In this simulation, macrophages could <lb/>capture tumor-associated antigen and immunocomplexes, breaking them down and <lb/>eliminating them from the system. This vaccine elicited a combination of three stimuli: the <lb/>p185neu antigen expressed by the HER2/neu gene, allogeneic major histocompatibility <lb/>complex (MHC) molecules, and IL-12 which enhances antigen presentation. Using this <lb/>model, after calibration and validation, the authors were able to evaluate different protocols <lb/>of vaccine administration. The simulation results suggested that in order to maximize <lb/>protection while reducing the number of administrations, the vaccination strategy should <lb/>include a significant dosage early on and a few recalls afterwards. <lb/>Dreau et al. developed an ABM model of solid tumor progression to understand the <lb/>interplay between solid tumor growth, tumor vascular growth, and the host&apos;s immune system <lb/>[119]. The model includes tumor and immune cells, vasculature, tumor cell proliferation, <lb/>and immune system response. Their model supported immunotherapy as an effective cancer <lb/>treatment in individuals with functioning immune systems. They concluded that a strong <lb/>immune response limits tumor growth in a way that cannot be achieved under a weaker <lb/>immune response. Another study focused on the role of T-cells in the effectiveness of <lb/>response to immunotherapy in B-16 melanoma [120]. The model includes macrophages, <lb/>DC, tumor vasculature, and interactions between these components. It was found that early <lb/>entry of T-cells effectively eliminated the tumor and was dependent on CD137 (a co-<lb/>stimulatory protein that helps in tumor rejection [121]) expression in tumor vasculature. <lb/>Oncolytic virus therapy is a strategy that utilizes viral infection to kill cancer cells, but not <lb/>normal cells, with the potential of enhancing T-cell recruitment to the tumor and increasing <lb/>their access to cancer cells. Several computational models have examined the conditions of <lb/>success for this type of therapeutic in silico [122]. Walker et al. developed an agent-based <lb/>model of pancreatic tumors to study the synergy between chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) <lb/>T-cell therapy and oncolytic virus therapy [123]. CAR T-cell therapy is one type of adoptive <lb/>cell transfer treatment involving genetically engineered T-cells specifically targeting cancer <lb/></body>

			<body>cells, and has been the subject of several computational models [124]. The agent-based <lb/>model recapitulates treatment mechanisms including cancer specific CAR T-cell recruitment <lb/>to the tumor site via vasculature and the injection and spread of oncolytic virus. Rohrs et al. <lb/>demonstrated the ability of the model to track the dynamics of cancer cells and stromal cells <lb/>in space in the presence of the treatment combinations; optimization of the combination <lb/>therapy requires more accurate calibration [124]. <lb/>Immune checkpoint inhibitors are used in cancer immunotherapy that enhances anti-tumor <lb/>immune response by targeting cancer immune evasion mechanisms. In many cancer types, <lb/>tumor neoantigens are sufficiently immunogenic to promote the expansion of antitumor <lb/>immune cells [125]; however, these immune cells are not functional due to the inhibitory <lb/>signals from molecules adaptively induced during cancer development [24,126]. Among <lb/>them, one of the most prominent mechanisms is PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, where T-cells are <lb/>suppressed through PD-1 signaling upon contact with induced PD-L1 in the tumor <lb/>microenvironment. Gong et al. developed an ABM of tumor-immune interaction in 3D to <lb/>study the spatio-temporal dynamics of cancer cells and cytotoxic T-cells [127]. In this study, <lb/>the inhibitor to the checkpoint molecules were modeled as a factor which modulates the <lb/>parameter governing the suppression of tumor specific T-cells by PD-L1+ cancer cells. They <lb/>found that patient responsiveness to such therapy could be associated with the level of <lb/>mutational burden of the cancer and antigen strength among patients. They also found that <lb/>tumor growth is insensitive to the vascular density of the tumor core. From these results, a <lb/>scoring method was proposed to predict anti-PDL1 treatment efficacy in patients. <lb/>3.5. Models Focusing on Tumor-Enhancing Immune Cells <lb/>While the immune system has evolved to kill off tumor cells, there are many ways in which <lb/>cancer cells can avoid immune detection. In addition, there is mounting evidence that <lb/>immune cells can stimulate tumor growth under certain conditions. Several agent-based <lb/>models have focused on understanding the tumor-enhancing contributions of the immune <lb/>system. Enderling and colleagues explored the interactions between tumor cell death and the <lb/>immune system using a cellular automata model focused on the interplay between cancer <lb/>stem cells and the immune system [128]. They showed that immune system-induced tumor <lb/>cell death led to stem cell selection, and thus, more aggressive tumors [128,129]. In this <lb/>model, even though immune cells effectively killed off tumor cells, they also affected <lb/>progenitor cells. This resulted in the creation of a space for cancer stem cells to proliferate <lb/>and produce more cancer stem cells. This ultimately resulted in a larger stem cell population <lb/>and a more aggressive tumor. <lb/>Several studies have specifically focused on the tumor-enhancing contribution of immune <lb/>cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Macrophages are one of the most <lb/>abundant immune cells found in tumors, but their population is heterogeneous [130]. M1-<lb/>type macrophages have been shown to be tumor inhibiting, whereas M2-type macrophages <lb/>have been shown to be tumor enhancing [26]. One model looked at the transition from the <lb/>M1 to M2 macrophage phenotype on tumor growth and then predicted targeted therapies <lb/>[131]. Knútsdóttir et al. used a hybrid model to investigate epidermal growth factor (EGF) <lb/>and macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) signaling between macrophages and <lb/></body>

			<body>cancer cells during macrophage aggregation [132]. They found that CSF-1/CSFR1 autocrine <lb/>signaling affects the ratio of tumor cells to macrophages during tumor growth. In a further <lb/>study, they found that the macrophage/tumor cell ratio was most sensitive to the strength of <lb/>EGF signaling, but usually maintained a 1:3 ratio [133]. <lb/>Another ABM of triple-negative breast cancer examined the tumor enhancing effects of <lb/>macrophages [134]. Norton et al. investigated the interplay between tumor growth, blood <lb/>vessel recruitment and macrophage recruitment through tumor vasculature. They observed <lb/>that while macrophages increase tumor growth, excessive macrophage recruitment <lb/>conversely leads to a decrease in tumor growth due to the inhibition of proliferation resulting <lb/>from overcrowding. <lb/>3.6. Models Focusing on Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity <lb/>Intra-tumor heterogeneity and the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment are found <lb/>to have important implications in the outcome of disease progression [135]. Patients often <lb/>have varied responses to treatment because each patient is unique in their genome, <lb/>microbiome, disease history, lifestyle, and environment. The case of tumors is especially <lb/>complex, because this heterogeneity is observed not only between tumors, but also between <lb/>subpopulations of cells from the same tumor, resulting in different response to drugs [136]. <lb/>While capturing this degree of heterogeneity may be difficult in experiments and clinical <lb/>trials, especially the temporal dynamics of spatial heterogeneity, computational models are <lb/>especially suited to tackling this challenge. This section focuses on the models that have <lb/>aimed to capture intra-tumor heterogeneity. <lb/>A 2D agent-based model was used to study the interactions between an avascular tumor and <lb/>immune cells (NK cells and cytotoxic T-cells) [137]. They examined the effects of cancer <lb/>cell proliferation on overall tumor growth under two conditions: the first, where cancer cells <lb/>do not consider the microenvironment when deciding when to proliferate, and the second, <lb/>where they proliferate based on the number of healthy cells surrounding them. Tumor-<lb/>immune cell interaction can have three outcomes: tumor cell death, immune cell death, or no <lb/>cell death based on the state of the tumor. The predicted growth of the tumor was then <lb/>compared to a xenograft tumor growth. Spatial heterogeneity was also examined in a <lb/>different model where cancer cells use glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation to <lb/>increase their energy production. In order to study how this increased energy production <lb/>affects the surrounding stroma, a combination of computational modeling and in vitro/in <lb/>vivo experiments was used [138]. They used agent-based modeling to understand tumor <lb/>growth in a vascularized area of the tumor. They found that tumors develop spatial patterns <lb/>where macrophages and tumor cells coexisted in areas with high levels of oxygen, but that <lb/>only tumor cells survived in ischemic regions. They then used an in vitro tissue-mimetic <lb/>system to create the directional gradients for oxygen and lactate, which also allowed for the <lb/>co-culture of tumor cells and macrophages. <lb/>Figueredo et al. created a series of hybrid models to study the interplay between the immune <lb/>system (including macrophages) and tumor cells [139,140]. An agent-based on-lattice model <lb/>for tumors was created using Chaste (Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment), part of <lb/>the Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) Toolkit; the model consists of three layers: a <lb/></body>

			<body>diffusible layer, a cellular layer, and a subcellular layer [141]. The diffusible layer consists <lb/>of diffusible species such as oxygen, the cellular layer consists of normal cells, tumor cells, <lb/>and macrophages, and the subcellular layer governs apoptosis and cell-cycle in each cell. In <lb/>this model, macrophages were M1-like, they supported the immune system, and aided <lb/>immunotherapies. They investigated the growth of the tumor under oxygen-dependent <lb/>proliferation. They found that the emergent behavior of agent-based models allowed for the <lb/>generation of additional tumor architectures over other modeling methodologies [142]. <lb/>4. Discussion and Emerging Applications <lb/>The immune system is made up of many interacting components that together drive a <lb/>complex spatio-temporal behavior during immune response. Thus, agent-based modeling is <lb/>particularly suitable for understanding the immune systems function in health and in disease <lb/>conditions such as cancer. Here, we reviewed the latest agent-based and hybrid models that <lb/>investigate the contributions of the immune system to cancer growth and the effect of <lb/>immunotherapy. In this context, we focused on models of immune-related tumor <lb/>mechanobiology, tumor-associated vasculature, tumor-associated lymphatics, tumor <lb/>immunotherapies, tumor-enhancing immune cells, and finally, models focusing on intra-<lb/>tumor heterogeneity. Overall, ABM can generate novel hypotheses to be validated and <lb/>refined by future experiments. Development and refinement of multiscale agent-based <lb/>models along with experiments through an iterative process can improve our understanding <lb/>of biological processes in cancer and lead to the identification of novel prognostic and <lb/>predictive biomarkers that can improve therapies and help design and interpret the results of <lb/>clinical trials [143]. <lb/>Models investigating the tumor-enhancing effects of the immune system can provide useful <lb/>insights into managing tumor-immune interactions. Since the tumor microenvironment can <lb/>be very heterogeneous, care must be taken to appropriately model cell-cell interactions <lb/>between cancer, stromal, and immune cells, the extracellular matrix, and the secreted factors. <lb/>Accurate data from in vitro and in vivo experiments must be used to understand the <lb/>transition from tumor-inhibiting to tumor-enhancing immune cell types. In addition, since <lb/>immune cells such as macrophages and T-cells are usually recruited to the tumor by secreted <lb/>factors, an evolving tumor vasculature is necessary to accurately model these processes. <lb/>Agent-based models of the tumor enhancing effects of the immune system can help us better <lb/>understand how to prevent or revert the immune system back into a tumor-inhibiting <lb/>phenotype. Thus, these models will help improve immunotherapies for cancer treatment. <lb/>One limitation of the immunotherapy studies mentioned above is that although the models <lb/>are quantitative in many aspects, the modules governing drug delivery and response is <lb/>relatively qualitative or semi-quantitative in nature. This could potentially be resolved by <lb/>combining spatio-temporal agent-based models with traditional model types, such as <lb/>Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to track drug distribution in <lb/>different physiological compartments, and pharmacodynamic (PD) models for individual <lb/>cellular agents to represent effects of drugs on target cells [144]. Such hybrid quantitative <lb/>systems pharmacology (QSP) models can be utilized not only as a platform for basic science <lb/>research, but also as a potential complement to the clinical research and drug discovery <lb/></body>

			<body>pipeline. A schematic of such a hybrid model based on the research in our own group is <lb/>presented in Figure 3. Compared with continuous models, the discretely represented agents <lb/>allow the flexibility to track intra-tumor heterogeneity, such as tumor neoantigen profile, T-<lb/>cell clonality and local expression of immune checkpoint molecules with preferred levels of <lb/>granularity. By running multiple simulations in parallel using different parameter values and <lb/>initial conditions accounting for genetic background and environmental exposure, the <lb/>models can represent cohorts of patients with desired population scale heterogeneity. These <lb/>properties render agent-based and hybrid models a powerful platform for conducting virtual <lb/>clinical trials. <lb/>Computer models provide large-scale predictive power by allowing us to simulate clinical <lb/>trials with sufficient details to study response to various conditions. Using these models, it is <lb/>possible to test and predict drug failures in simulations rather than in patients, which could <lb/>result in improved drug design, reduced risks and side effects, and can dramatically decrease <lb/>costs of drug development. Importantly, models can predict how the immune-tumor system <lb/>evolves during the course of the treatment [136]. The challenge is that available data for <lb/>individual patients is limited. To address this problem, machine learning approaches can be <lb/>used to build statistical models based on available patient data, and these models can be <lb/>employed to simulate virtual populations to predict the effects of therapies [145]. These <lb/>approaches have already been expanded to identify biomarkers and find important mutations <lb/>that affect response to treatment with drugs in cancer cell lines [146-148]. <lb/>Mechanistic models are another suitable approach that provides large-scale predictive <lb/>capabilities based on the available information on the interactions between various <lb/>components of a biological system. These models can be discrete or continuous. A certain <lb/>type of model is chosen based on the application and availability of the data [149,150]. <lb/>Depending on the type of the model, predictions can be made for the behavior of the <lb/>signaling system in a qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative manner. For example, for <lb/>quantitative predictions of signaling and regulatory gene networks, continuous variables <lb/>need to be modeled on continuous time scales using ODEs [151]. <lb/>Such detailed modeling requires knowledge of important biological reactions at every step. <lb/>This can only be achieved in several iterative steps that include the implementation of <lb/>various components such as signaling events and defining values for related parameters and <lb/>appropriate initial conditions. In recent years, numerous models have been developed that <lb/>simulate individual signaling pathways [152-154]. The challenge is that these models often <lb/>do not fully capture crosstalk mechanisms that are crucial in predicting patient response to <lb/>treatment, as each drug perturbs multiple biological processes. ODE-based models can be <lb/>combined with agent-based models to capture the dynamics of the system being modeled in <lb/>a more complex fashion. Stochasticity is one of the main advantages of agent-based models, <lb/>as it applies to biological processes [155]. In comparison to ODE models that make <lb/>predictions of concentrations and other events over time, ABM allows the study of each <lb/>agent, as it interacts with other agents in their proximity and the ways in which that affects <lb/>the large-scale behavior. These models, however, are computationally more expensive. There <lb/>are also challenges in validating results from ABM due to insufficient spatio-temporal data <lb/>on tumor development [156]. <lb/></body>

			<body>One aspect that is typically missing from mechanistic knowledge-based models including <lb/>QSP and ABM is an input from high-throughput data, genomic or proteomic; such data can <lb/>inform the models and can supplement the data obtained at the cellular and tissue levels <lb/>[157]. Examples include immune landscape information from different sources including <lb/>patients&apos; databases such as TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) [33,158,159]. Another <lb/>source of &quot;Big Data&quot; for parameterization and validation of the models, including ABM, <lb/>will be the emerging methodologies of digital pathology, such as using multiplex <lb/>immunofluorescence (mIF) of patients&apos; biopsies and resected tumors, with subsequent <lb/>analysis of cellular and molecular spatial patterns. Steps in this direction are already <lb/>underway [160]. Another source of data is image-based, using microCT, confocal, <lb/>multiphoton, and super resolution microscopy, both ex vivo and in vivo; examples include <lb/>imaging entire tumor vasculature with subsequent computer simulation of blood flow and <lb/>molecular transport [161,162]. <lb/>In addition to modeling approaches used to simulate response to treatment, virtual patients <lb/>are a key component of virtual clinical trials. A virtual population has the characteristics of <lb/>the original patient population but also includes individual diversity, usually comprising <lb/>parameter sets weighted by a clinical or response distribution [163]. This diversity allows <lb/>testing a broad range of responses that can be missed in a clinical trial. In contrast to <lb/>traditional clinical trials that can only be performed after costly and lengthy development, in <lb/>silico trials could be performed at every stage of the drug development. In silico design of <lb/>treatments can be conducted with data-driven or mechanistic-based (knowledge-based) <lb/>approaches [164]. It should be noted that in silico clinical trials require integration of data at <lb/>different scales via a multi-model approach using virtual patients. Similar to a traditional <lb/>clinical trial, rigorous statistical approaches are needed at various steps of virtual clinical <lb/>trials. The ability to test treatment via in silico clinical trials can significantly reduce the cost <lb/>and increase the efficacy of drug development. <lb/>The main challenge in the way of predictive models for virtual clinical trials is the <lb/>availability of input data for the model for each patient. Detailed knowledge about the <lb/>situation at the start of the simulation can significantly affect the predictive power of that <lb/>model. Such input information is being generated at a growing rate and a lower cost. <lb/>Furthermore, proteomic data enable the modeling of interactions of different subgroups of <lb/>cells from the same tumor with each other as well as immune cells and other stromal cells, <lb/>allowing modeling tumors for individual patients. Computational models can make <lb/>predictions for the optimal treatments, making it safer, faster, and cheaper to complement <lb/>current clinical trials. These models will improve by continuous comparison of predicted <lb/>and actual response to therapy. Additionally, as more detailed information on biological <lb/>parameters and disease mechanisms become available, the accuracy of the models will <lb/>increase. <lb/>Currently, only 1 in 10s of clinical trials results in drugs that make it to the market [165]. <lb/>The process takes 10-12 years, costing billions of dollars, sometimes with low effectiveness <lb/>when used by real patients [136]. Although virtual clinical trials with virtual patients and <lb/>virtual cohorts cannot replace clinical trials, they can inform design of such trials to improve <lb/>success rates and increase the efficacy of the process of drug development. Virtual trials can <lb/></body>

			<body>also better address the need for personalized therapy [166]. Finally, combining agent-based <lb/>models and data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) methods (e.g., machine learning, <lb/>including deep learning), we can better understand the gap between preclinical findings and <lb/>clinical outcomes. <lb/>In summary, in silico modeling and specifically agent-based modeling are powerful tools of <lb/>cancer systems biology and cancer immune systems biology. Combined with novel <lb/>measurement methodologies and increasing amounts and sophistication of data available <lb/>from clinical trials, they should bring a better mechanistic understanding and predictive <lb/>capabilities of therapeutic interventions in cancer, including immunotherapies. The field is <lb/>ripe for conducting predictive virtual clinical trials as a prerequisite to clinical trials in <lb/>patients. <lb/></body>

			<body>Figure 3. <lb/>Diagram of a multi-compartment hybrid model capturing tumor development and anti-tumor <lb/>immune response. Dynamics of cells and pharmacokinetics of drug (e.g., antibody) in the <lb/>lymphatics, tumor-draining lymph node, central (blood) and peripheral compartments are <lb/>modeled using ordinary differential equation systems. Spatial dynamics of cells and <lb/>molecules in the tumor compartment are captured using agent-based model and partial <lb/>differential equations. Death of cancer cells produces antigens which drive maturation of <lb/>APC and their migration to the tumor draining LN, where CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells go <lb/>through priming and proliferation before they enter blood circulation and extravasate to the <lb/>tumor microenvironment. Effector CD8+ T-cells can be further activated and expanded when <lb/>they encounter tumor antigens. These cytotoxic cells kill cancer cells and also release <lb/>various cytokines, including IL2 which drives further proliferation of T-cells, and IFNγ <lb/>which is proinflammatory and induces PD-L1 expression on cancer cells. PD-L1 can then <lb/>bind to PD-1 molecules on cytotoxic T-cells, resulting in T-cell exhaustion. Both PD-L1 and <lb/>PD-1 molecules are potential targets for immune checkpoint blockade antibodies. <lb/>Regulatory cell types in the ABM include Treg and MDSC, which can inhibit cytotoxic T <lb/>lymphocytes (CTL) through different mechanisms. <lb/></body>
