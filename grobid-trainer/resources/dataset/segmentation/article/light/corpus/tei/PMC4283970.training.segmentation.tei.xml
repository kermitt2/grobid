			<body>Introduction <lb/>Currently, dental therapy is an accepted component of the <lb/>dental profession in the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consor-<lb/>tium and in the state of Minnesota. Additionally, there are <lb/>several states that have consumer groups working to enact <lb/>legislation to permit the practice of dental therapy as a <lb/>component of the dental team. However, in the absence <lb/>of nationally recognized educational standards, concerns <lb/>have been raised that as dental therapy initiatives move <lb/>forward, a patchwork of dental therapists at different skill <lb/>levels will emerge, rather than a uniform vision of dental <lb/>therapy practice. While there is always a case for flexi-<lb/>bility in education and special types of practitioners within a <lb/>given field, it is important that the basic education <lb/>for that field be well defined. Therefore, in 2010 a panel <lb/>of academicians met under the auspices of the American <lb/>Association of Public Health Dentistry (AAPHD) and <lb/>prepared a report on the principles, competencies, and <lb/>curriculum for educating dental therapists. The panel&apos;s <lb/>report, laying the foundation for the type of educational <lb/>experience that all dental therapists should possess, was <lb/>published in a special issue of the Journal of Public Health <lb/>Dentistry (1). <lb/>The question now arises regarding what the minimal stan-<lb/>dards should be for educational institutions that wish to <lb/>sponsor dental therapy programs. To address this question <lb/>and to follow up on the work of the first AAPHD panel con-<lb/>cerning curriculum, a second panel was convened to address <lb/>education standards. The second panel was convened <lb/>under the auspices of Community Catalyst, an organization <lb/>working with consumer groups in five states regarding dental <lb/>therapy. <lb/>In establishing the Education Standards Panel, it was rec-<lb/>ognized that there were already three different sponsors of <lb/>dental therapy educational programs in the United States: <lb/>one in a dental school, another a collaboration between a <lb/>health system and a university, and a third in a university-<lb/>community college setting containing an established dental <lb/>hygiene program. While each of these programs differ in <lb/>certain aspects of their curricula, they share a common <lb/>understanding of the central issues in defining an institu-<lb/>tion&apos;s commitment for sponsoring dental therapy programs. <lb/>Additionally, the leaders of these programs are considered <lb/></body>

			<body>pioneers in the establishment of their programs, with the <lb/>passion needed at the beginning of a new category of dental <lb/>provider within the US profession of dentistry, albeit not new <lb/>worldwide. Representatives of each of these programs were <lb/>invited to participate on the Panel. The Panel also included <lb/>an experienced dental therapist from Canada and dental <lb/>academicians. <lb/>The purpose of this article is to describe the Panel&apos;s delib-<lb/>erations on three critical issues in developing the report, Rec-<lb/>ommended Standards for Dental Therapy Education Programs <lb/>in the United States (2). They are: the length of the program <lb/>and degree to be awarded; credentials of the program direc-<lb/>tor; and the nature of supervision. The full Report can be <lb/>accessed at http://www.communitycatalyst.org/doc-store/ <lb/>publications/dental-therapy-education-standards.pdf <lb/>Program length and degree <lb/>Regarding the length of the program and degree to be <lb/>awarded, Panel members from the three existing programs <lb/>each viewed this issue differently, as each of their programs <lb/>differed in program length and degree awarded. The Alaska <lb/>Dental Health Aide Therapist program is a postsecondary <lb/>school program 2 years in length and awards a certificate rec-<lb/>ognized by the Federal government; the Metropolitan State <lb/>University College of Nursing and Health Sciences offers a <lb/>Master of Science degree program for licensed dental hygien-<lb/>ists who hold a baccalaureate degree; and the University of <lb/>Minnesota School of Dentistry offers two programs, a <lb/>28-month curriculum that requires 1 year of college prereq-<lb/>uisite coursework and awards a baccalaureate degree, and a <lb/>28-month master of dental therapy for those holding a bacca-<lb/>laureate degree. So, the degrees and lengths of the programs <lb/>varied among the three existing programs. <lb/>The issues raised by Panel members were mostly related to <lb/>the vision of the type of person that dental therapy should <lb/>attract to the field and the setting for the program. One point <lb/>of view was that the program length should be appropriate <lb/>for educating dental therapists to competence, but not be too <lb/>long to dissuade applicants that come from underserved <lb/>communities from applying. It is these types of individuals <lb/>who would most likely return to serve in those communities. <lb/>Another point of view was that these practitioners should at <lb/>least hold a baccalaureate degree to provide confidence in the <lb/>profession and public&apos;s eye for the scope of practice that <lb/>the law allows. Another issue dealt with the setting for the <lb/>program. If a baccalaureate degree were requisite, commu-<lb/>nity colleges, the traditional setting for many dental hygiene <lb/>and dental assisting programs, would be unable to offer <lb/>dental therapy programs. The Panel&apos;s recommendation is as <lb/>follows: <lb/>The curriculum must include at least two calendar years <lb/>of full-time instruction or its equivalent at the <lb/>post-secondary level if the graduates of the program will <lb/>be prepared for practice only as a dental therapist. In a <lb/>two-calendar-year curriculum, the graduates of the <lb/>program must be awarded an associate degree. If the <lb/>graduates of the program will be prepared for practice in <lb/>both dental therapy and dental hygiene, the curriculum <lb/>must include at least three calendar years of full time <lb/>instruction or its equivalent. <lb/>While there was not uniform consensus among the panelists <lb/>on this point, the Panel recommended a 2-year program <lb/>and an associate degree based on the idea that these are <lb/>minimum standards that have worldwide evidence of <lb/>success, community colleges could sponsor programs, and <lb/>recruitment of students from low-income communities, <lb/>where oral disease is more prevalent, and would more likely <lb/>consider dental therapy as a career within their reach. Also, <lb/>this standard does not preclude an institution from offering <lb/>longer periods of education and degrees beyond an associ-<lb/>ate degree. <lb/>Program director <lb/>The considerations around the credentials for the program <lb/>director recognized that in the United States the practice of <lb/>dental therapy is just at its beginning. There is not yet a suffi-<lb/>cient cadre of trained dental therapist that have sufficient <lb/>background and experience to direct a program. The Panel <lb/>recommended that there must be a licensed dentist as part of <lb/>the leadership of the program when the program director is <lb/>someone other than a licensed dentist. The rationale for this is <lb/>well stated in the Introduction to the Report: <lb/>The Panel recommends that each program must have a <lb/>director who is generally qualified to administer the <lb/>program; provided, that if the program director is not a <lb/>licensed dentist, the program must also have a dental <lb/>director who is a licensed dentist who supports the <lb/>program director through continual involvement in the <lb/>program. As the dental therapy profession grows and <lb/>matures, a cohort of dental therapy academics will <lb/>become established and available to educate, mentor <lb/>and lead students in entering the profession. The <lb/>recommended standard will allow programs to select such <lb/>a dental therapist-academic at an appropriate future stage <lb/>and, in the meantime, allows programs the flexibility <lb/>to choose either a currently-licensed dentist or other <lb/>qualified individual, such as a dental hygiene academic or <lb/>an individual with general program administration <lb/>qualifications, with support from a dentist. <lb/>Nature of supervision <lb/>The Panel recognized that each state that passes legislation <lb/>would establish the type of supervision required in their state. <lb/></body>

			<body>The Panel&apos;s recommendations are based on the premise that <lb/>the dental therapist would work under the supervision of a <lb/>dentist but wished to highlight the importance of the collab-<lb/>orative nature of that relationship. The Introduction of the <lb/>Report states the concerns expressed by the Panel members <lb/>regarding this issue: <lb/>The recommended standards are not intended to prepare <lb/>a dental therapist for independent practice. The <lb/>competencies included in the standards are to be <lb/>practiced by the dental therapist under the supervision <lb/>of a licensed dentist as part of a collaborative oral health <lb/>team. Collaborative practice occurs when oral health care <lb/>providers from different professional backgrounds pursue <lb/>shared goals and outcomes and work together with <lb/>patients and their families to deliver the highest quality <lb/>of care. The type and definition of supervision and/or <lb/>collaboration required will vary among states and tribes. <lb/>The standards are intended to provide the dental therapist <lb/>with the knowledge, skills and values to work toward <lb/>shared goals with the dentist and other team members <lb/>within a range of practice settings, supervisory structures <lb/>and collaborative practice arrangements. <lb/>For dental therapists practicing under general supervision <lb/>where the dentist and therapists are in different locations, col-<lb/>laborative practice becomes essential for good patient care. <lb/>This statement and the actual standard recognize the impor-<lb/>tance of the relation between the dentist and the therapist. <lb/>Value of the recommended standards <lb/>The purpose of preparing these Standards for Dental Therapy <lb/>Education Programs is to make available to states and others a <lb/>consensus of what is necessary to sponsor a dental therapy <lb/>program. The strength of these recommended standards is <lb/>that they were written with the direct input of the existing <lb/>dental therapy programs and an experienced dental therapist. <lb/>The fact that the program leadership of the existing pro-<lb/>grams, which all differ from each other, could come together <lb/>and agree upon these minimum standards should assure that <lb/>the recommendations are sound and take into account the <lb/>best information from the field. <lb/>At the time the Panel began this endeavor, there was no <lb/>guidance for institutions that wished to begin education pro-<lb/>grams. Subsequently, the Commission on Dental Accredita-<lb/>tion (CODA), based on the request from the University of <lb/>Minnesota, School of Dentistry, prepared a draft set of stan-<lb/>dards for the accreditation of dental therapy programs at the <lb/>baccalaureate program (3). While many of the standards in <lb/>the CODA draft standards and those recommended by this <lb/>Panel are similar, they differ in at least two ways. First, CODA <lb/>proposes a program length of 3 years with a baccalaureate <lb/>degree as a minimum standard. As explained previously, this <lb/>Panel recommends a minimum standard as 2 years with an <lb/>associate degree. It is not apparent why CODA&apos;s draft sug-<lb/>gests a longer period of education and a baccalaureate degree. <lb/>A second difference revolves around a competence in assess-<lb/>ment and judgment. This Panel recommends that dental <lb/>therapists be competent and have specific knowledge and <lb/>judgment to identify oral conditions, and be able to create <lb/>and monitor healthcare protocols in consultation with a col-<lb/>laborating dentist (see Appendix for the assessment and judg-<lb/>ment competencies). The Minnesota Board of Dentistry <lb/>notes &quot;an oral evaluation and assessment of dental disease <lb/>and the formulation of an individualized treatment plan <lb/>authorized by the collaborating dentist&quot; as a competency only <lb/>for Advanced Dental Therapists (4). However, it seems <lb/>prudent to provide the necessary education for all dental <lb/>therapists in the area of patient assessment as a prerequisite <lb/>for them to fulfill their scope of practice. The CODA draft <lb/>standards seem to imply that only the dentist can provide <lb/>assessment. It states: <lb/>The system of patient care in which the dental therapist <lb/>provides care to address the patient&apos;s oral condition or <lb/>needs under the supervision of a licensed dentist who will <lb/>be responsible for assessment of the implications of the <lb/>patient&apos;s medical condition, diagnosis risk assessment <lb/>prognosis and treatment planning. <lb/>Because the major reasons to add a new provider to the pro-<lb/>fession is to address the needs of the underserved, and this <lb/>may happen in school-based systems or in community-based <lb/>locations where the dentist and dental therapists may be in <lb/>different locations, it seems important that the educational <lb/>system provide dental therapists with the ability to perform <lb/>assessments under the supervision of the dentist. <lb/>In summary, this Panel has proposed these standards to <lb/>assist institutions that wish to educate dental therapists as a <lb/>means to provide dental services in communities that lack <lb/>access to care. CODA should review and consider these edu-<lb/>cational standards as they move from draft accrediting stan-<lb/>dards to those that will be implemented in the future. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Appendix <lb/>Note: The intent of this Section is to establish a minimum standard of competency but allow each education program the flexibility to determine <lb/>which specific competencies to include in its program based on what is included in the scope of practice established by the applicable regulatory <lb/>authority. These standards should not be interpreted to expect education programs to be educating and training students to perform services that are <lb/>prohibited under the law of their jurisdiction. The proposed standards are minimum standards, but the intent is that each education program will <lb/>educate and train students to the full scope of practice that is authorized in its jurisdiction. <lb/>Competencies <lb/>Graduates must be competent in providing oral health care within the scope of dental therapy to patients across the lifespan, to include care for the <lb/>child, adolescent, adult, special needs, and geriatric patient. The program curriculum must support the following competencies within the scope of <lb/>dental therapy practice: <lb/>1. Assessment and judgment <lb/>1.1. Identify conditions requiring consultation and treatment that the dental therapist is competent to provide. <lb/>1.2. Identify conditions requiring treatment by dentists, physicians, other healthcare providers, and manage referrals. <lb/>1.3. Document existing oral conditions and the care that is provided (record keeping). <lb/>1.4. Perform and document information from commonly used tests and procedures such as radiographs, pulp vitality tests, dental impressions, and <lb/>caries and periodontal disease risk assessments. <lb/>1.5. Evaluate patients&apos; oral health knowledge and access to healthcare professionals, and identify personal, family, economic, geographic, and <lb/>other barriers to seeking and using care. <lb/>1.6. Inform patients and recommend comprehensive oral care. <lb/>1.7. Create and monitor comprehensive, customized long-term oral healthcare protocols for patients, in consultation with a collaborating dentist. <lb/>1.8. Identify and use the full range of available dental, medical, and other healthcare resources available in the community. <lb/>1.9. Provide treatment within the dental therapist&apos;s scope of practice and referrals, based on assessment of individuals&apos; general and dental health <lb/>and social and personal circumstances. <lb/>1.10. Provide treatment and referral based on previously approved clinical protocols, taking into consideration a patient&apos;s social and personal circum-<lb/>stances. <lb/>1.11. Apply ethical, legal and regulatory practices and principles to the provision of oral health care to patients. <lb/>1.12.
