A questionnaire <lb/>was used to survey the attitudes of lung cancer patients and caregivers <lb/>toward ADs. <lb/>Results: A total of 148 lung cancer patients and 149 caregivers were enrolled <lb/>into the study. Of these, 94.6% and 89.9% of patients and caregivers had <lb/>not heard of AD and none of those in the study had ever signed an AD. A <lb/>total of 79.7% patients and 75.2% caregivers were willing to sign ADs after <lb/>they were provided with information. Patients who preferred the end of <lb/>life period to sign ADs were 5.4 times more likely to have ADs than patients <lb/>who chose to sign ADs when their disease was diagnosed (P &lt; 0.05, <lb/>95%CI [1.27-22.93]). Caregivers who were reluctant to undergo chemother-<lb/>apy when diagnosed with cancer were 2.16 times more likely to sign ADs <lb/>than those willing to receive chemotherapy (P &lt; 0.05, 95%CI [1.20-3.90]). <lb/>Conclusions: In China, lung cancer patients and their caregivers showed lack of <lb/>knowledge about ADs, and the completion rate of ADs was extremely low. How-<lb/>ever, participants were positive about ADs and public education on ADs may <lb/>help to increase the completion rate of ADs in China. <lb/>Key points <lb/>Significant findings of the study: Lung cancer patients and their caregivers <lb/>lacked knowledge about ADs, and the completion rate of ADs was <lb/>extremely low. <lb/>What this study adds: Participants were positive about ADs and public edu-<lb/>cation on ADs may help increase the completion rate of ADs in China. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Advance directives (ADs) are legal documents in which <lb/>people choose the medical treatments they are, or are not, <lb/>willing to receive if in the future they lose the capacity to <lb/>talk about their wishes. 1 It gives people the right to choose <lb/>medical treatments following their values and wishes and <lb/>helps to minimize suffering and maintain dignity at the last <lb/>time of their life. 2,3 It has been reported that ADs are asso-<lb/>ciated with a reduction in aggressive treatments, 4-6 fewer <lb/>in-hospital deaths, increased use of hospices, 5,7 and lower hos-<lb/>pital charges. 8 Absence of ADs may lead to unwanted aggres-<lb/>sive treatments, which correlates to poor quality of life. In <lb/>tradition, Chinese families value interdependency between <lb/>family members, 11 and close relatives make decisions when <lb/>family members lose their capacity to communicate. As a <lb/>result, ADs could also help prevent family members from the <lb/>difficult situation of having to guess what kind of care their <lb/>loved ones would choose. <lb/></body>

			<body>Countries such as the United States, 12 Germany, 13 and <lb/>Singapore 14 have already developed legislation for ADs. <lb/>In 2000, Taiwan was the first place in Asia to enact <lb/>legislation to provide people with the right to make do-<lb/>not-resuscitate (DNR) decisions. However, there is no <lb/>legislation for ADs in mainland China. 16 The overall <lb/>AD preparation rate is low. Previous studies have indi-<lb/>cated that completion of ADs was 14%-30% among the <lb/>general population, 17-19 and 15%-49% among cancer <lb/>patients. 18,20-23 Many factors are associated with having <lb/>ADs including sociodemographic characteristics such as <lb/>age, 20 level of education, gender, religious beliefs, <lb/>health or functional status, 25,26 public education on <lb/>ADs, 14,27,28 and traditional perspectives. 22 Little work <lb/>has been done on the perception of ADs in both the <lb/>general and ill populations. Some studies have reported <lb/>the impact of patients and family members&apos; knowledge, <lb/>attitudes, and behaviors on the completion of ADs. <lb/>However, most of these studies focused on various can-<lb/>cers 29 or chronic diseases. 30 Since different diseases <lb/>have different diagnosis and treatment procedures <lb/>and mortality differs among them, it seems necessary <lb/>to focus on a specific disease. Moreover, there has been <lb/>a lack of comparison between patients and caregiv-<lb/>ers since some studies have analyzed these data <lb/>together. 16,31 Patients and caregivers may hold different <lb/>attitudes toward ADs since healthy people may have no <lb/>idea about the situation when they are ill. <lb/>Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the word, <lb/>with over 1.8 million new cases and about 1.6 million <lb/>deaths in 2012. 32 It is also the leading cause of cancer-<lb/>related death. 33 More than one third of all newly diag-<lb/>nosed lung cancers occur in China, 33 with the mortality <lb/>rate being higher than the international average level. <lb/>To our knowledge, there has been no study about lung <lb/>cancer patients&apos; and caregivers&apos; attitudes toward ADs in <lb/>mainland China and also a lack of comparison between <lb/>them. Therefore, we conducted this cross sectional <lb/>study which aimed to investigate the attitudes of lung <lb/>cancer patients and caregivers toward ADs. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Study design <lb/>A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department <lb/>of Oncology outpatient clinic in West China Hospital of <lb/>Sichuan University (Chengdu, China). <lb/>Participants in the study <lb/>Between June 2017 and October 2017, 148 patients and <lb/>149 caregivers from West China Hospital, Sichuan <lb/>University were enrolled in the study by convenience sam-<lb/>pling. Patients&apos; inclusion criteria were: (i) Aged between <lb/>18 and 75 years old, (ii) diagnosed with lung cancer, <lb/>(iii) having no communication disability with interviewers, <lb/>(iv) informed consent. Exclusion criteria: (i) Do not know <lb/>his or her cancer diagnosis. Caregivers inclusion criteria: <lb/>(i) Aged between 18 and 75 years old, (ii) having no com-<lb/>munication disability with interviewers, (iii) informed con-<lb/>sent. Exclusion criteria: (i) Diagnosed with disease that <lb/>may threaten their life such as cancer, heart diseases, etc. <lb/>Measurements <lb/>Sociodemographic characteristics included gender, age, <lb/>marital status, education level, relationship between care-<lb/>giver and patient, address, current work status, personal <lb/>income (annual), medical insurance, religion, experience in <lb/>caring for seriously ill people, experiences of a loved one <lb/>dying of serious illness, disease duration, Numerical Rating <lb/>Scale (NRS) reflecting pain score, metastasis, complication, <lb/>radiotherapy times, and cycle of chemotherapy. <lb/>Based on previous studies, 16,24,35 we developed a struc-<lb/>tured questionnaire to explore the attitudes of patients and <lb/>caregivers toward ADs. The content validity of the ques-<lb/>tionnaire was tested by a group of five experts in the field <lb/>of end-of-life care and lung cancer. Items rated under four <lb/>(ranged from 1 = least relevant to 5 = most relevant) were <lb/>modified or deleted. After three rounds of modification, <lb/>the content validity index of the questionnaire was 0.93. <lb/>Data collection process <lb/>Patients and caregivers were informed about the aims and <lb/>process of the study when they visited the Oncology outpa-<lb/>tient clinic. After obtaining their informed consents, they <lb/>were interviewed by two researchers and data were ana-<lb/>lyzed by a third researcher. <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>SPSS software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA; version 17.0) <lb/>was used. Mean and standard deviation (SD) was used to <lb/>describe continuous variables. Percentages and frequencies <lb/>were applied to describe categorical variables. Chi-square <lb/>test was used to examine the proportion differences in <lb/>patients and caregivers&apos; characteristics and their attitudes <lb/>toward ADs. Binary logistic regression analysis was then <lb/>conducted to identify predictor of completion of ADs. <lb/>P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>Participants&apos; characteristics <lb/>148 lung cancer patients and 149 caregivers were enrolled <lb/>into this study. The characteristics of participants are <lb/>showed in Table 1. The mean (SD) age of patients and <lb/>caregivers were 58.4 (11.96) and 45.18 (12.59), respectively. <lb/>Most of the patients&apos; education level was primary and <lb/>junior high school, while for caregivers, most were high <lb/>school/vocational high school level. Both participants of <lb/>cancer patients and caregivers mainly lived in the urban <lb/>area. Characteristics including gender, age, education level, <lb/>relationship between caregivers and patients, current work <lb/>status, personal income, and experience in caring for seri-<lb/>ously ill people showed a significant difference between <lb/>patients and caregivers (P &lt; 0.05). <lb/>Perception and willingness of patients and <lb/>caregivers toward ADs <lb/>A total of 140 patients (94.6%) and 134 caregivers (89.9%) <lb/>had never heard of ADs. There were 118 (79.7%) patients <lb/>who were willing to sign ADs when the concept of ADs <lb/>was explained to them. There was a significant difference <lb/>between patients and caregivers regarding the time to pre-<lb/>pare ADs (P &lt; 0.001). A total of 34.5% of patients pre-<lb/>ferred to sign ADs when treatment commenced and 31.1% <lb/>chose to complete ADs when they were diagnosed with <lb/>disease. A total of 112 (75.2%) caregivers were willing to <lb/>sign ADs, and 42 (28.2%) caregivers chose to have ADs <lb/>when they were healthy. Of the caregivers, 27.5% preferred <lb/>to have ADs when they were diagnosed with incurable dis-<lb/>ease or when their incurable disease was getting worse, <lb/>respectively. There was a significant difference between <lb/>patients and caregivers about the question that whose <lb/>advice will they largely rely on when making medical deci-<lb/>sions (P &lt; 0.001). A total of 60.2% of the patients chose <lb/>medical services mainly relying on the advice of medical <lb/>staff, while for caregivers, 44.3% of them would rely on <lb/>Table 1 Characteristics of participants <lb/>Characteristics <lb/>Patients <lb/>(n = 148)n % <lb/>Caregiver <lb/>(n = 149)n % P-value <lb/>Gender <lb/>0.004 <lb/>Female <lb/>61 (41.2) <lb/>86 (57.7) <lb/>Male <lb/>87 (58.8) <lb/>63 (42.3) <lb/>Age, mean <lb/>58.4 (11.96) 45.18 (12.59) 0.000 <lb/>≤44 <lb/>18 (12.2) <lb/>78 (52.3) <lb/>45-59 <lb/>51 (34.5) <lb/>43 (28.9) <lb/>60-74 <lb/>70 (47.3) <lb/>28 (18.8) <lb/>≥75 <lb/>9 (6.1) <lb/>0 (0) <lb/>Marital status <lb/>0.678 <lb/>Married <lb/>133 (89.9) <lb/>136 (91.3) <lb/>Single <lb/>15 (10.1) <lb/>13 (8.7) <lb/>Education level <lb/>0.000 <lb/>Illiterate <lb/>4 (2.7) <lb/>2 (1.3) <lb/>Primary and junior high school <lb/>82 (55.4) <lb/>33 (22.1) <lb/>High school/vocational <lb/>high school <lb/>43 (29.1) <lb/>74 (49.7) <lb/>University and college <lb/>17 (11.5) <lb/>29 (19.5) <lb/>Graduate school <lb/>2 (1.3) <lb/>11 (7.4) <lb/>Relationship between <lb/>caregiver and patient <lb/>0.000 <lb/>Spouse <lb/>89 (60.1) <lb/>52 (34.9) <lb/>Relatives <lb/>44 (29.8) <lb/>91 (61.1) <lb/>Others <lb/>15 (10.1) <lb/>6 (4.0) <lb/>Residence <lb/>0.664 <lb/>Rural area <lb/>39 (26.4) <lb/>36 (24.2) <lb/>Urban area <lb/>109 (73.6) <lb/>113 (75.8) <lb/>Current work status <lb/>0.000 <lb/>Retired <lb/>59 (39.9) <lb/>24 (16.1) <lb/>Unemployed <lb/>46 (31.1) <lb/>46 (30.9) <lb/>Employed <lb/>43 (29.0) <lb/>79 (53.0) <lb/>Personal income (annual) <lb/>0.000 <lb/>≤10 000 <lb/>47 (31.8) <lb/>34 (22.8) <lb/>10 000-50 000 <lb/>78 (52.7) <lb/>61 (40.9) <lb/>000-100 000 <lb/>20 (13.5) <lb/>40 (26.8) <lb/>≥100 000 <lb/>3 (2.0) <lb/>14 (9.5) <lb/>Medical insurance <lb/>0.304 <lb/>Yes <lb/>132 (89.2) <lb/>138 (92.6) <lb/>No <lb/>16 (10.8) <lb/>11 (7.4) <lb/>Religiousness <lb/>0.781 <lb/>Religious <lb/>8 (5.4) <lb/>7 (4.7) <lb/>Nonreligious <lb/>140 (94.6) <lb/>142 (95.3) <lb/>Experience in caring for <lb/>seriously ill people <lb/>0.000 <lb/>Yes <lb/>34 (23.0) <lb/>80 (53.7) <lb/>No <lb/>114 (77.0) <lb/>69 (46.3) <lb/>Disease duration <lb/>-<lb/>&lt;3 years <lb/>130 (87.8) <lb/>-<lb/>≥3 years <lb/>18 (12.2) <lb/>-<lb/>NRS score, median (range) <lb/>0 (0-10) <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>Metastases <lb/>-<lb/>Yes <lb/>36 (24.3) <lb/>-<lb/>No <lb/>112 (75.7) <lb/>-<lb/>Complication <lb/>-<lb/>Yes <lb/>28 (18.9) <lb/>-<lb/>No <lb/>120 (81.1) <lb/>-<lb/>Table 1 Continued <lb/>Characteristics <lb/>Patients <lb/>(n = 148)n % <lb/>Caregiver <lb/>(n = 149)n % P-value <lb/>Radiotherapy times, <lb/>median (range) <lb/>0 (0-39) <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>Chemotherapy times, <lb/>median (range) <lb/>0 (0-20) <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>For caregivers, disease information including disease duration, NRS <lb/>score, metastases, complication, radiotherapy times, chemotherapy <lb/>times were not collected.

			<body>The basic life-sustaining treatment, cardiopulmonary <lb/>resuscitation (CPR), and rescue medication use were the <lb/>three mostly selected medical cares for all the participants <lb/>at terminal and cardiac arrest status, followed by sedative <lb/>drug and painkiller use (Table 3). There was no difference <lb/>of medical choices at terminal status and cardiac arrest for <lb/>both lung cancer patients and caregivers. <lb/>For lung cancer patients, there were significant differ-<lb/>ences in attitude toward having ADs among patients <lb/>choosing different time to have ADs (P &lt; 0.01) and those <lb/>relying on different people&apos;s advice to make medical <lb/>choices. No differences in gender, age, marital status, edu-<lb/>cation level, current work status or other characteristics <lb/>were found between groups with different attitudes <lb/>towards ADs (Table 4). Compared with patients who pre-<lb/>ferred to have ADs at the time of disease diagnosis, those <lb/>preferring end time of life as the time to have ADs were <lb/>5.4 times more likely to have ADs in the future (Table 5). <lb/>For caregivers, there were differences in attitude toward <lb/>having ADs among groups with different attitudes toward <lb/>the management of patients, including whether patients <lb/>should know the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease, <lb/>willingness to advocate surgery and radiotherapy for <lb/>patients, and caregivers own willingness to receive radio-<lb/>therapy and chemotherapy if they were diagnosed with <lb/>cancer. No differences in gender, marital status, education <lb/>level, current work status or other characteristics were <lb/>found between the two groups with different attitudes <lb/>toward ADs (Table 6). For caregivers, those who were <lb/>reluctant to undergo chemotherapy when they were diag-<lb/>nosed with cancer were 2.16 times more likely to prepare <lb/>ADs than those willing to receive chemotherapy (Table 7). <lb/>Discussion <lb/>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus <lb/>on lung cancer patients&apos; and caregivers&apos; attitudes toward <lb/>ADs in China. In our study, 94.6% of the patients and <lb/>89.9% caregivers had never heard of ADs, and none had <lb/>signed ADs. Our results were similar to a previous study <lb/>conducted in China focusing on various cancers, 24 in which <lb/>all of the 526 cancer patients did not have ADs, and 90% <lb/>of them had never heard of the terminology of &quot;advance <lb/>directive&quot;. There were obvious disparities in the compari-<lb/>son of the rate of completion of ADs in China with that of <lb/>other countries that had AD legislation. In Germany, 18% <lb/>of cancer patients, 19% of healthy people, and 28%-31% <lb/>hematology and oncology outpatient patients had signed <lb/>ADs. 36,37 In Korea, 35.5% of patients in a Hospice Center <lb/>completed ADs, 23 and in the report by White et al. 14% of <lb/>the Australian population had ADs. After being informed <lb/>about the concept of ADs, 79.7% of the patients and 75.2% <lb/>of the caregivers were willing to have ADs, which was in <lb/>line with previous studies conducted in various cancer <lb/>patients. 16 Interestingly, at the very beginning, our <lb/>researchers were concerned about the cancer patients&apos; <lb/>cooperation with the investigation. However, during the <lb/>investigation, most of the patients were cooperative, indi-<lb/>cating their willingness to accept ADs. China has experi-<lb/>enced great development and fast modernization during <lb/>the past several decades, and the behavior of Chinese peo-<lb/>ple and their values have greatly changed with the rapid <lb/>development of the economy. 38 At the same time, patients&apos; <lb/>sense of autonomy and self-determination has increased, 16 <lb/>which may help explain the overall positive attitude toward <lb/>ADs. A previous report indicated that insufficient knowl-<lb/>edge was frequently given as the reason for declining <lb/>ADs. 36 Therefore, it reminds us that the legislation of ADs <lb/>should be placed on the agenda, and that wider public edu-<lb/>cation of the benefit of ADs is essential. <lb/>We also found some interesting differences of partici-<lb/>pants&apos; attitude toward several questions. Most patients <lb/>made their decisions mainly relying on the information <lb/>and advice of medical staff. However, for caregivers, the <lb/>Table 3 Medical choices of participants at terminal status and cardiac arrest <lb/>Terminal status <lb/>Cardiac arrest <lb/>Medical choices <lb/>Patients % <lb/>Caregiver % <lb/>Patients % <lb/>Caregiver % <lb/>The basic life-sustaining treatment † <lb/>134 (90.5) <lb/>137 (91.9) <lb/>136 (91.9) <lb/>123 (82.6) <lb/>CPR † <lb/>83 (56.1) <lb/>84 (56.4) <lb/>89 (60.1) <lb/>76 (51.0) <lb/>Rescue medication use (such as pressor, respiratory stimulant <lb/>drugs) † <lb/>81 (54.7) <lb/>79 (53.0) <lb/>90 (60.8) <lb/>95 (63.8) <lb/>Sedative † <lb/>65 (43.9) <lb/>61 (40.9) <lb/>61 (41.2) <lb/>51(34.2) <lb/>Painkiller † <lb/>64 (43.2) <lb/>58 (38.9) <lb/>54 (36.5) <lb/>64 (43.0) <lb/>Tracheal intubation † <lb/>21 (14.2) <lb/>19 (12.8) <lb/>15 (10.1) <lb/>13 (8.7) <lb/>Stomach tube † <lb/>7 (4.7) <lb/>7 (4.7) <lb/>6 (4.0) <lb/>6 (4.0) <lb/>Urinary catheter † <lb/>7 (4.7) <lb/>8 (5.4) <lb/>6 (4.0) <lb/>6 (4.0) <lb/>Abandon † <lb/>7 (4.7) <lb/>8 (5.4) <lb/>6 (4.0) <lb/>11 (7.4) <lb/> †There was no difference for both participants&apos; medical choices at terminal status and cardiac arrest.

			<body>on medical staff, while healthy people cannot put them-<lb/>selves into a situation where they are ill, and they don&apos;t <lb/>have to rely on the advice of medical staff. Therefore, they <lb/>may think that their own willingness is more important, <lb/>which demonstrates that different attitudes toward ADs <lb/>are dependent upon health status. Therefore, we need to <lb/>investigate the attitude of people towards ADs when they <lb/>are both healthy and ill. <lb/>In China, many caregivers would not tell patients about <lb/>their disease diagnosis and prognosis for the fear of the <lb/>pressure this may place on them. However, the results of <lb/>our study indicated that all patients wanted to know their <lb/>diagnosis and prognosis, but there were still 37.6% of care-<lb/>givers who said that they did not want patients to know <lb/>the truth. The differences between patients and caregivers <lb/>toward disease, life, and death should be given more atten-<lb/>tion. In Chinese culture, when people lose their ability to <lb/>communicate, caregivers play an important role in assisting <lb/>patients to choose the medical options available to them. <lb/>To be aware of a person&apos;s attitude and willingness when <lb/>they are healthy may assist caregivers in making decisions <lb/>for patients in the future. <lb/>Patients and caregivers were invited to choose their medi-<lb/>cal cares when they were at terminal stage and cardiac <lb/>arrest. Before that, the meaning of terminal status and car-<lb/>diac arrest was explained to them. Basic life-sustaining treat-<lb/>ment, CPR, and use of rescue medication were the main <lb/>options chosen by participants of both health statuses, <lb/>followed by use of sedatives and painkillers. Other invasive <lb/>procedures such as tracheal intubation, or use of a stomach <lb/>tube were less preferred. There were no significant differ-<lb/>ences of willingness to medical treatments between lung <lb/>cancer patients and caregivers and both patients and healthy <lb/>people showed their first choice was to receive life saving <lb/>treatments. Our results were different to those of the study <lb/>of Zheng et al.24 in which the majority of patients chose <lb/>comfort care only, followed by limited care. The reasons <lb/>may be that 82.1% of the participants in the report by Zheng <lb/>et al. were religious and the study reported that faith can <lb/>influence cancer patients&apos; medical decisions, and make them <lb/>more likely to refuse the recommendations of physicians. <lb/>Moreover, the study by Zheng et al. included patients with <lb/>various cancers, while our study only focused on lung cancer <lb/>patients. The survival or mortality rate can be different in a <lb/>wide range of diseases, and therefore patients may have dif-<lb/>ferent confidence in overcoming the disease. Furthermore, <lb/>contrary to our study, in the study by Kong et al. 23 most ter-<lb/>minal cancer patients did not want to receive any invasive <lb/>medical interventions to sustain life. Possible reasons for this <lb/>may be that our patients were not yet at the terminal stage <lb/>of illness and terminal cancer patients may already have suf-<lb/>fered many invasive treatments and have known about their <lb/>prognosis. This indicates that we should pay attention to the <lb/>possibility of patients wanting to change their end of life AD <lb/>and future studies should be conducted which take this pref-<lb/>erence for care into account. <lb/>Patients preferred end time of life as the time when an <lb/>AD should be in place and were 5.4 times more likely to <lb/>have ADs at that stage than those choosing to have ADs <lb/>when first diagnosed. A previous study has reported that <lb/>completion of ADs in the last months of life was associated <lb/>with higher rates of aggressive care preferences. 26 Allison <lb/>et al. also reported that those preparing too late may be in <lb/>a rush to make a decision and did not represent patients&apos; <lb/>values and willingness. 40 Those results confirm that atten-<lb/>tion should be paid to those who prepare ADs at the end <lb/>time of life because ADs may cannot help to maintain peo-<lb/>ple&apos;s dignity at that time. For those patients, early educa-<lb/>tion so that they understand the meaning of ADs should <lb/>be compulsory. <lb/>For caregivers, those who were reluctant to undergo che-<lb/>motherapy when they become ill were 2.16 times more <lb/>likely to prepare ADs than those willing to receive chemo-<lb/>therapy. Chemotherapy is a commonly used treatment in <lb/>the majority of lung cancer patients, which might prolong <lb/>survival but can still cause adverse effects. This result may <lb/>be because some people are afraid of the adverse effects of <lb/>treatment and the suffering which can be caused by che-<lb/>motherapy, and those choosing not to receive chemother-<lb/>apy showed that they want more comfortable treatments, <lb/>but not to prolong survival. Therefore, they would like to <lb/>have ADs to reflect their willingness. <lb/>Our study had some limitations. First, it was conducted <lb/>only in one single hospital and the sample size was small <lb/>both for patients and caregivers, which may be the reason <lb/>why the study has not highlighted other factors. Multi-<lb/>center studies with a larger sample size are required in the <lb/>future to improve the representativeness of the partici-<lb/>pants. Second, some important information such as pat-<lb/>ients&apos;cancer stage could not be accessed due to the cross <lb/>sectional study design. As a result, some meaningful results <lb/>may have been left out of the investigation. <lb/>In conclusion, Chinese lung cancer patients and their <lb/>caregivers lacked knowledge concerning ADs, and the <lb/>completion rate of ADs was extremely low. However, after <lb/>Table 5 Binary logistic regression analysis of factors which predict <lb/>patients willing to prepare ADs <lb/>Variables <lb/>OR (95%CI) <lb/>P-value <lb/>Timing to prepare ADs <lb/>When diagnosed with incurable disease <lb/>1 <lb/>When receiving treatments <lb/>0.39 (0.12-1.25) <lb/>When the disease is getting worse <lb/>1.01 (0.37-2.80) <lb/>End of life <lb/>5.40 (1.27-22.93) &lt;0.05 <lb/>ADs, advance directives. <lb/></body>
