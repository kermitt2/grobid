			<front>Sharing of Very Short IBD Segments between <lb/>Humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans <lb/>Gundula Povysil and Sepp Hochreiter <lb/>Institute of Bioinformatics, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria <lb/>Institute of Bioinformatics, Johannes Kepler University Linz <lb/>Research Report <lb/>Institute of Bioinformatics <lb/>Johannes Kepler University Linz <lb/>A-4040 Linz, Austria <lb/>Tel. +43 732 2468 4520 <lb/>Fax +43 732 2468 4539 <lb/>http://www.bioinf.jku.at <lb/> 2 <lb/> Abstract <lb/>Abstract <lb/>We analyze the sharing of very short identity by descent (IBD) segments between humans, <lb/>Neandertals, and Denisovans to gain new insights into their demographic history. Short IBD <lb/>segments convey information about events far back in time because the shorter IBD segments are, <lb/>the older they are assumed to be. The identification of short IBD segments becomes possible <lb/>through next generation sequencing (NGS), which offers high variant density and reports variants <lb/>of all frequencies. However, only recently HapFABIA has been proposed as the first method for <lb/>detecting very short IBD segments in NGS data. HapFABIA utilizes rare variants to identify IBD <lb/>segments with a low false discovery rate. <lb/>We applied HapFABIA to the 1000 Genomes Project whole genome sequencing data to <lb/>identify IBD segments which are shared within and between populations. Some IBD segments are <lb/>shared with the reconstructed ancestral genome of humans and other primates. These segments are <lb/>tagged by rare variants, consequently some rare variants have to be very old. Other IBD segments <lb/>are also old since they are shared with Neandertals or Denisovans, which explains their shorter <lb/>lengths compared to segments that are not shared with these ancient genomes. The Denisova <lb/>genome most prominently matched IBD segments that are shared by Asians. Many of these seg-<lb/>ments were found exclusively in Asians and they are longer than segments shared between other <lb/>continental populations and the Denisova genome. Therefore, we could confirm an introgression <lb/>from Deniosvans into ancestors of Asians after their migration out of Africa. While Neandertal-<lb/>matching IBD segments are most often shared by Asians, Europeans share a considerably higher <lb/>percentage of IBD segments with Neandertals compared to other populations, too. Again, many <lb/>of these Neandertal-matching IBD segments are found exclusively in Asians, whereas Neandertal-<lb/>matching IBD segments that are shared by Europeans are often found in other populations, too. <lb/>Neandertal-matching IBD segments that are shared by Asians or Europeans are longer than those <lb/>observed in Africans. This hints at a gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of Asians and <lb/>Europeans after they left Africa. Interestingly, many Neandertal-or Denisova-matching IBD seg-<lb/>ments are predominantly observed in Africans -some of them even exclusively. IBD segments <lb/>shared between Africans and Neandertals or Denisovans are strikingly short, therefore we assume <lb/>that they are very old. This may indicate that these segments stem from ancestors of humans, <lb/>Neandertals, and Denisovans and have survived in Africans. <lb/>Note: We present preliminary results on chromosome 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project. This <lb/>preprint will be soon completed with results from the other chromosomes. <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>The recent advent of next generation sequencing technologies made whole genome sequencing <lb/>of thousands of individuals feasible (47). These sequencing techniques have been extended to <lb/>allow sequencing of ancient DNA which enabled researchers to assemble the DNA of hominid <lb/>individuals that lived ten thousands of years ago (15, 31, 35, 37). These advances in biotechnology <lb/>could help to answer one of the most fundamental questions of humanity: &quot;Where do we come <lb/>from?&quot; <lb/>In 2012, the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (48) published first results on the genomes of <lb/>more than thousand individuals from 14 populations stemming from Europe, East Asia, Africa, <lb/>and the Americas. Reviewing the differences in genetic variation within and between populations, <lb/>the authors found evidence of past events such as bottlenecks or admixtures, but also regions <lb/>which seemed to be under a strong selective pressure. Gravel et al. (14) used the sequence data <lb/>of the individuals from the Americas of the 1000 Genomes Project to quantify the contributions <lb/>of European, African, and Native American ancestry to these populations, to estimate migration <lb/>rates and timings, as well as to develop a demographic model. <lb/>Green et al. (15) were the first to analyze a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome derived <lb/>from the bones of three individuals from Vindija Cave in Croatia that died about 40,000 years <lb/>ago. They found that non-African individuals share more alleles with the Neandertal genome <lb/>than sub-Saharan Africans. Until then evidence from mtDNA (9, 25, 42) and the Y chromosome <lb/>(24) suggested that Neandertals lived isolated in Europe and Asia until they were replaced by <lb/>anatomically modern humans. Although this theory still holds if differences in allele sharing are <lb/>attributed to the existence of an ancient population substructure within Africa (10, 29), ancient <lb/>admixture events between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans outside of Africa are <lb/>considered as a more plausible explanation (15, 28, 40, 56). Further studies (31, 55) reported more <lb/>Neandertal DNA preserved in modern East Asians than Europeans, hinting at some admixture after <lb/>the separation of ancestors of Europeans and Asians. Prüfer et al. (35) confirmed higher rates of <lb/>sharing for non-Africans using a high-quality genome sequence of a Neandertal from Denisova <lb/>Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. The authors further report that populations in Asia and <lb/>America have more regions of Neandertal origin than populations in Europe. <lb/>A bone of a sister group of Neandertals, named Denisovans after the cave in the Altai Moun-<lb/>tains of Siberia, was sequenced first at low (37) and later at high coverage (31). Studies on <lb/>the low coverage draft sequence, as well as on the high coverage sequence, reported contribu-<lb/>tions from Denisovans to the gene pool of present-day individuals in Southeast Asia and Oceania <lb/>(31, 37, 38, 43). Additionally to the clear signal of the Denisova genome found in Oceanians, <lb/>Prüfer et al. (35) detected some regions of Denisovan origin in East and Southeast Asians and <lb/>also in populations of the Americas, but only very few in Europeans. The authors further report <lb/>gene flow from Neandertals and an unknown archaic population into Denisovans indicating that <lb/>interbreeding among distinct hominid populations was more common than previously thought. <lb/> Using the high coverage Altai Neandertal genome Sankararaman et al. (39) screened the 1000 <lb/>Genomes Project data for Neandertal ancestry with the genomes of the West African Yoruba <lb/>individuals from Ibadan, Nigeria, as a reference panel that are assumed to harbor no Neandertal <lb/>ancestry. They again found more Neandertal ancestry in East-Asians than in Europeans, but also <lb/>very low levels in African Luhya individuals from Webuye, Kenya. The authors further looked for <lb/>regions in the genome with very high or very low Neandertal ancestry that both might be due to <lb/></body>

			<body>selective pressure. Vernot and Akey (53) searched for signatures of introgression in the sequences <lb/>of Asian and European individuals of the 1000 Genomes Project and compared them with the <lb/>Altai Neandertal genome. They confirmed more Neandertal DNA in East Asians than Europeans <lb/>and looked for different levels of introgression along the genome. <lb/>In this study we propose to use short segments of identity by descent (IBD) to infer the popula-<lb/>tion structure of humans and to gain insights into the genetic relationship of humans, Neandertals <lb/>and Denisovans. <lb/>1.1 IBD for Inferring Population Structure <lb/>A DNA segment is identical by state (IBS) in two or more individuals if they all have identical <lb/>nucleotide sequences in this segment. An IBS segment is identical by descent (IBD) in two or <lb/>more individuals if they have inherited it from a common ancestor, that is, the segment has the <lb/>same ancestral origin in these individuals. Rare variants can be utilized for distinguishing IBD <lb/>from IBS without IBD because independent origins are highly unlikely for such variants. In other <lb/>words, IBS generally implies IBD for rare variants, which is not true for common variants (44, <lb/>Ch. 15.3, p. 441). <lb/>IBD detection methods have already been successfully used for inferring population structure. <lb/>Gusev et al. (16) looked for long IBD segments shared within and between populations to estimate <lb/>the demographic history of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. Using similar models Palamara et al. <lb/>(34) and Carmi et al. (7) reconstructed the demographic history of Ashkenazi Jewish and Kenyan <lb/>Maasai individuals. Botigué et al. (3) confirmed gene flow from North Africans into Southern <lb/>Europeans via patterns of long shared IBD segments. Ralph and Coop (36) tried to quantify the <lb/>recent shared ancestry of different European populations by looking for long segments of shared <lb/>DNA. Gravel et al. (14) similarly tried to draw conclusions of the genetic history of populations <lb/>in the Americas using the respective data of the 1000 Genomes Project. <lb/>Except for Gravel et al. all of these studies were performed on SNP microarray data as IBD <lb/>segments could not reliably be detected in large sequencing data. Sequencing data has higher <lb/>marker density and also captures rare variants in contrast to SNP microarray data, therefore they <lb/>would allow for a finer resolution of the length of IBD segments. Furthermore all previous studies <lb/>based on microarrays were limited to long IBD segments that stem from a very recent common <lb/>ancestor. However, shorter IBD segments would convey information about events farther back in <lb/>time because the shorter IBD segments are, the older they are assumed to be. Therefore, existing <lb/>studies were not able to resolve demographic histories at a fine scale and very far back into the <lb/>past. <lb/>1.2 HapFABIA for Extracting Short IBD Segments <lb/>We recently developed HapFABIA (19) (see http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkt1013 ) to <lb/>identify very short segments of identity by descent (IBD) that are tagged by rare variants (the so <lb/>called tagSNVs) in large sequencing data. HapFABIA identifies 100 times smaller IBD segments <lb/>than current state-of-the-art methods: 10 kbp for HapFABIA vs. 1 Mbp for state-of-the-art <lb/>methods. HapFABIA utilizes rare variants (≤5% MAF) to distinguish IBD from IBS without IBD <lb/>because independent origins of rare minor alleles are highly unlikely (44, Ch. 15.3,p. 441). More <lb/></body>

			<body>importantly, rare variants make juxtapositions of smaller IBD segments unlikely which prevents <lb/>the summary of several small IBD segment into one long IBD segment. Consequently, the length <lb/>of IBD segments is estimated more accurately than with previous methods. <lb/>In experiments with artificial, simulated, and real genotyping data HapFABIA outperformed <lb/>its competitors in detecting short IBD segments (19). HapFABIA is based on biclustering (20) <lb/>which in turn uses machine learning techniques derived from maximizing the posterior in a Bayes <lb/>framework (8, 21, 22, 23, 30, 41, 45, 46). <lb/>HapFABIA is designed to detect short IBD segments in genotype data that were obtained from <lb/>next generation sequencing (NGS), but can also be applied to DNA microarray data. Especially <lb/>in NGS data, HapFABIA exploits rare variants for IBD detection. Rare variants convey more <lb/>information on IBD than common variants, because random minor allele sharing is less likely <lb/>for rare variants than for common variants (5). In order to detect short IBD segments, both the <lb/>information supplied by rare variants and the information from IBD segments that are shared <lb/>by more than two individuals should be utilized (5). HapFABIA uses both. The probability of <lb/>randomly sharing a segment depends <lb/>(a) on the allele frequencies within the segment, where lower frequency means lower prob-<lb/>ability of random sharing, and <lb/>(b) on the number of individuals that share the allele, where more individuals result in lower <lb/>probability of random segment sharing. <lb/>The shorter the IBD segments, the higher the likelihood that they are shared by more individuals. <lb/>A segment that contains rare variants and is shared by more individuals has higher probability <lb/>of representing IBD (18, 27). These two characteristics are our basis for detecting short IBD <lb/>segments by HapFABIA. <lb/></body>

			<body>2 IBD Segments on Chr. 1 of the 1000 Genomes Data <lb/>2.1 The 1000 Genomes Data <lb/>We used HapFABIA to extract short IBD segments from the 1000 Genomes Project genotyping <lb/>data (48), more specifically, the phase 1 integrated variant call set (version 3) containing phased <lb/>genotype calls for SNVs, short indels, and large deletions. This data set consists of 1,092 individu-<lb/>als (246 Africans, 181 Admixed Americans, 286 East Asians, and 379 Europeans), 38.2M SNVs, <lb/>2.4M short indels, and 14k large deletions. We removed 36 individuals because they showed <lb/>cryptic relatedness to others. The final data set consisted of 1056 individuals (228 Africans, 175 <lb/>Admixed Americans, 277 East Asians, and 376 Europeans). Chromosome 1 contains 3,007,196 <lb/>SNVs that are on average 83 bp apart and have an average minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.066. <lb/>2,280,175 (75.8%) SNVs are rare (MAF ≤ 0.05 including privates), 664,225 (22.1%) are private <lb/>(minor allele is observed only once), 33,100 (1.1%) have an MAF of zero, and 693,921 (23.1%) <lb/>are common (MAF &gt; 0.05). We kept only the rare SNVs for IBD detection and excluded private <lb/>ones. <lb/>Chromosome 1 was divided into intervals of 10,000 SNVs with adjacent intervals overlapping <lb/>by 5,000 SNVs. After removing common and private SNVs, we applied HapFABIA with default <lb/>parameters to these intervals ignoring phase information since previous analysis revealed many <lb/>phasing errors. <lb/>2.2 Summary Statistics of the Detected Short IBD Segments <lb/>HapFABIA found 105,652 different very short IBD segments on chromosome 1. These contained <lb/>635,280 rare tagSNVs, which amounts to 27.9% of the rare variants (39.3% if private SNVs are <lb/>excluded) and 21% of all SNVs. The distance between centers of IBD segments had a median of <lb/>1.1 kbp and a mean of 2.4 kbp and ranged from 0 (overlapping IBD segments) to several Mbp. The <lb/>number of individuals that shared the same IBD segment was between 2 and 113, with a median <lb/>of 5 and a mean of 10.7. IBD segments were tagged by 8 to 223 tagSNVs, with a median of 13 <lb/>and a mean of 18.8. The length of IBD segments ranged from 62 base pairs to 21 Mbp, with a <lb/>median of 25 kbp and a mean of 27 kbp. IBD lengths are computed as described in Section 4.1, to <lb/>match the assumptions for the distribution of IBD segment lengths as derived in other publications <lb/>(4, 16, 50, 51). <lb/></body>

			<body>3 Sharing of IBD Segments Between Populations and With Ancient <lb/>Genomes <lb/>3.1 Sharing of IBD Segments Between Human Populations <lb/>3.1.1 Sharing Between All Human Populations <lb/>We were interested in the distribution of IBD segments among different populations. The main <lb/>continental population groups are Africans (AFR), Asians (ASN), Europeans (EUR), and Ad-<lb/>mixed Americans (AMR), where AMR consist of Colombian, Puerto Rican, and Mexican indi-<lb/>viduals. Table 1 lists the number of IBD segments that are shared between particular continental <lb/>populations. The vast majority (101,209) of the detected IBD segments (105,652) is shared by <lb/>Africans (at least one African possesses the segment), of which 64,894 are exclusively found in <lb/>Africans. Only 9,003 and 4,793 IBD segments are shared by Europeans and Asians, respectively. <lb/>558 IBD segments are exclusively found in Europeans and 1,452 exclusively in Asians. Admixed <lb/>Americans share 207 IBD segments with Asians, but 1,008 with Europeans. Gravel et al. (14) <lb/>reported recently that Admixed Americans, especially Colombians and Puerto Ricans, show a <lb/>large proportion of European ancestry, which is also reflected in our results. If we additionally <lb/>consider sharing with AFR, we obtain similar figures that are again consistent with the AMR ad-<lb/>mixture: 4,325 IBD segments have AFR/AMR/EUR sharing while only 621 IBD segments have <lb/>AFR/AMR/ASN sharing. According to results of the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (48), <lb/>individuals with African ancestry carry much more rare variants than those of European or Asian <lb/>ancestry supporting our finding that most IBD segments are shared by Africans. We found that <lb/>few IBD segments are shared between two continental populations (Table 1 &quot;Pairs of Popula-<lb/>tions&quot;) confirming recently published results (13, 48) (see also Section 3.1.2). The relatively large <lb/>number of shared IBD segments between Africans and Europeans was due to many shared IBD <lb/>segments between the AFR sub-group ASW (Americans with African ancestry from SW US) and <lb/>Europeans. This tendency was also observed in the 1000 Genomes Project via the fixation index <lb/>F ST estimated by Hudson ratio of averages and via shared haplotype length around f 2 variants <lb/>(48). The high content of European DNA segments in ASW is consistent with the finding that in <lb/>African Americans a median proportion of 18.5% is European (6). <lb/>Overall, we conclude that IBD segments that are shared across continental populations, in <lb/>particular by Africans, date back to a time before humans moved out of Africa. Consequently, <lb/>the rare variants that tag these short IBD segments arose before this time. See Section A, for a <lb/>discussion of the question whether rare variants are recent or old. <lb/>3.1.2 Sharing of IBD Segments Between Continental Populations <lb/>We found that most IBD segments are observed in only one continental population, which are, in <lb/>most cases, Africans. However, for non-Africans, we saw a considerable sharing of IBD segments <lb/>across continental groups. The sharing between continental populations seems to contradict state-<lb/>ments in other publications. For example, Gravel et al. (13) report that sharing of SNVs between <lb/>continental groups is low. <lb/>Nevertheless, sharing between continental groups has also been reported in the publication of <lb/>the 1000 Genomes Project (48). The authors observed 17% of low-frequency variants in the range <lb/></body>

They also describe sharing of f 2 variants between Finnish (FIN) and African individuals. f 2 <lb/>variants are those variants for which their minor allele is observed in exactly 2 individuals. They <lb/>are rarer than most SNVs that tag our extracted IBD segments because, on average, 6 individuals <lb/>possess an IBD segment. According to Gravel et al. (13), sharing between continental groups de-<lb/>creases with rarer variants. Thus, in our extracted IBD segments, we would expect to find sharing <lb/>between continental groups considerably more often than for f 2 variants. Furthermore, the 1000 <lb/>Genomes Project Consortium (48) reports that f 2 variants that are shared between populations with <lb/>no recent common ancestry are present on very short haplotypes with a median length of 15 kb. <lb/>They conclude that these haplotypes are likely to reflect recurrent mutations and chance ancient <lb/>coalescent events. This statement also supports our findings of IBD sharing between continental <lb/>groups, but we can exclude recurrent mutations as a likely explanation because IBD segments are <lb/>shared between multiple individuals. <lb/>3.2 Sharing of IBD Segments Between Human and Ancient Genomes <lb/>Since short IBD segments are thought to be very old, we wondered whether some IBD segments <lb/>match bases of ancient genomes, such as Neandertal and Denisova. Ancient short IBD segments <lb/>may reveal gene flow between ancient genomes and ancestors of modern humans and, thereby, <lb/>may shed light on different out-of-Africa hypotheses (2). 31X coverage whole genome sequencing <lb/>data for the Denisova, as well as, the Altai Neandertal genome of 52X coverage were provided by <lb/>the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (31, 35). Considering only the variants <lb/>of the 1000 Genomes Project, 0.6% of the Denisova bases and 0.3% of the Neandertal bases were <lb/>not determined, 92.0% and 91.3%, respectively, matched bases of the human reference, and 8% <lb/>and 9%, respectively, matched either the human minor allele or were different from human alleles. <lb/>As additional information in the 1000 Genomes Project data, bases of the reconstructed common <lb/>ancestor of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orang utan, macaque, and marmoset genomes were given. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2.1 IBD Sharing Between Human Populations and Ancient Genomes <lb/>We tested whether IBD segments that match particular ancient genomes to a large extent are found <lb/>more often in certain populations than expected randomly. For each IBD segment, we computed <lb/>two values: The first value was the proportion of tagSNVs that match a particular ancient genome, <lb/>which we call &quot;genome proportion&quot; of an IBD segment (e.g. &quot;Denisova proportion&quot;). The second <lb/>value was the proportion of individuals that possess an IBD segment and are from a certain pop-<lb/>ulation as opposed to the overall number of individuals that possess this IBD segment. We call <lb/>this value the &quot;population proportion&quot; of an IBD segment (e.g. &quot;Asian proportion&quot;). Consider the <lb/>following illustrative examples. If an IBD segment has 20 tagSNVs of which 10 match Denisova <lb/>bases with their minor allele, then we obtain 10/20 = 0.5 = 50% as the Denisova proportion. If <lb/>an IBD segment is observed in 6 individuals of which 4 are Africans and 2 Europeans, then the <lb/>African proportion is 4/6 = 0.67 = 67% and the European proportion is 0.33 = 33%. A correlation <lb/>between a genome proportion and a population proportion would indicate that this ancient genome <lb/>is overrepresented in this specific population. Often human IBD segments that are found in ancient <lb/>genomes have already been present in the ancestral genome of humans and other primates. These <lb/>IBD segments would confound the interbreeding analysis based on IBD sharing between modern <lb/>human populations and Neandertals or Denisovans. Therefore, we removed those IBD segments <lb/>from the data before the following analysis. <lb/>-0.15 <lb/>-0.1 <lb/>-0.05 <lb/>0 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.1 <lb/>0.15 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0.25 <lb/>0.3 <lb/>0.35 <lb/>Denisova Pearson&apos;s Correlation Coefficient <lb/>Figure 1: Pearson&apos;s correlation between population proportions and the Denisova genome propor-<lb/>tion.

Europeans still have a significantly larger correlation to <lb/>the Denisova genome than the average. Mexicans (MXL) have also a surprisingly high correlation <lb/>to the Denisova genome while Iberians (IBS) have a low correlation compared to other Europeans. <lb/>Pearson&apos;s product moment correlation test and Spearman&apos;s rank correlation test both showed <lb/>highly significant correlations between the Denisova genome and Asians, the Denisova genome <lb/>and Europeans, the Neandertal genome and Asians, and the Neandertal genome and Europeans. <lb/></body>

Surprisingly, Mexicans (MXL) have a high correlation to the <lb/>Denisova genome too, while Iberians (IBS) have a low correlation compared to other Europeans. <lb/>These unexpected correlations can be explained through the fact that of all European populations <lb/>Iberians show the highest rates of African gene flow (1, 3, 32) whereas Mexicans show a high pro-<lb/>portion of Native American ancestry which in turn might also reflect gene flow from Asia (14, 33). <lb/>Figure 2 shows Pearson&apos;s correlation coefficients for the correlation between population propor-<lb/>tion and the Neandertal genome proportion. Europeans and Asians have a significantly larger <lb/>correlation to the Neandertal genome than other populations (p-value &lt; 5e-324). Asians have <lb/>slightly higher correlation coefficients than Europeans. Again Mexicans (MXL) have surprisingly <lb/>high correlation to the Neandertal genome while Iberians (IBS) have a low correlation compared <lb/>to other Europeans. <lb/>However, correlation tests are sensitive to accumulations of minor effects. Therefore, we <lb/>focused subsequently on strong effects, i.e. large values of genome proportions and large values <lb/>of population proportions. <lb/>We define an IBD segment to match a particular ancient genome if the genome proportion <lb/>is 30% or higher. Only 8% of the Denisova and 9% of the Neandertal bases (about 10% of the <lb/>called bases) match the minor allele of the human genome on average. Therefore, we require <lb/>an odds ratio of 3 to call an IBD segment to match an ancient genome. We found many more <lb/></body>

This <lb/>again supports the statement that the detected short IBD segments are old and some of them date <lb/>back to times of the ancestors of humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans. IBD segments that match <lb/>the Denisova genome often match the Neandertal genome, too, thus these segments cannot be <lb/>attributed to either one of these genomes. Therefore, we introduce the &quot;Archaic genome&quot; (genome <lb/>of archaic hominids ancestral to Denisova and Neandertal), to which IBD segments are attributed <lb/>if they match both the Denisova and the Neandertal genome. <lb/>To test for an enrichment of Denisova-, Neandertal-, or Archaic-matching IBD segments in <lb/>different subpopulations, we used Fisher&apos;s exact test for count data. Again, we first excluded those <lb/>IBD segments that were also present in the reconstructed ancestral genome of humans and other <lb/>primates. IBD segments were then classified as being shared by at least one individual of a certain <lb/>population or not and either matching or not matching the ancient genome. <lb/>−50 <lb/>0 <lb/>50 <lb/>−100 <lb/>0 <lb/>100 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>Denisova Odds <lb/>Figure 3: Odds scores of Fisher&apos;s exact test for an enrichment of Denisova-matching IBD segments <lb/>in different populations are represented by colored dots.

			<body>Admixed Americans show more sharing than Europeans (odds ratio of 2.63 vs. 2.11), although <lb/>the difference is not very prominent. In general these results reflect previous findings. Meyer <lb/>et al. (31) and Prüfer et al. (35) noted that Denisovans show more sharing with modern East <lb/>Asians and South Americans (called Admixed Americans here) than with Europeans. Within the <lb/>Asian populations Han Chinese from South (CHS) have slightly higher odds for matching the <lb/>Denisova genome than Han Chinese from Beijing (CHB), while Japanese (JPN) have the lowest <lb/>odds (Figure 4). Skoglund et al. (43) also report a particularly high affinity between Southeast <lb/>Asians and the Denisova genome, in contrast to Meyer et al.

			<body>findings. Other studies (15, 28) have reported significantly more sharing between Neandertals and <lb/>non-Africans than with Africans. Wall et al. (55) noted that Neandertals contributed more DNA to <lb/>modern East Asians than to Europeans. Within the Asian populations Han Chinese from Beijing <lb/>(CHB) have slightly higher odds for matching the Neandertal genome than Han Chinese from <lb/>South (CHS), while Japanese (JPN) lie in between (Figure 4). Within the European populations <lb/>a north to south decline can be seen with Finnish (FIN) having the highest odds for matching the <lb/>Neandertal genome followed by British from England and Scotland (GBR) and Utah residents with <lb/>ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU). Toscani in Italy (TSI) and Iberians from Spain <lb/>(IBS) show the lowest levels of matching (Figure 8). An explanation for the latter two low odds <lb/>for Neandertal matching is that according to Ralph et al. (36) Iberians and Italians show reduced <lb/>rates of shared ancestry compared to the rest of Europe. Also Botigué et al. (3) found higher IBD <lb/>sharing between North Africans and individuals from Southern Europe which would decrease the <lb/>amount of DNA sharing with Neandertals. Sankararaman et al. (39) achieved a similar ranking <lb/>for Neandertal ancestry using a different approach, but stated that because of the high standard <lb/>deviation among individuals from the same population, small differences may be due to statistical <lb/>noise. The same holds true for our results since a single individual with very high Neandertal <lb/>ancestry can lead to inflated odds for a population. Nevertheless, since all Asian populations show <lb/>especially high odds, we can exclude that all results are just due to noise. <lb/></body>

			<body>portion for the according IBD segment. More than half of the Neandertal-matching IBD segments <lb/>have Asians or Europeans as majority population proportions. However, still many Neandertal-<lb/>matching segments are mainly shared by Africans which to some extend contradicts the hypothesis <lb/>of Prüfer et al. (35) that Neandertal ancestry in Africans is due to back-to-Africa gene flow. For <lb/>the Archaic genome (intersection of Neandertal-and Denisova-matching IBD segments), IBD <lb/>segments dominated by Asians or Europeans are also enriched if compared to all IBD segments <lb/>found on chromosome 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project data (we will call the set of these seg-<lb/>ments &quot;human genome&quot;). The enrichment by Asian or European IBD segments is lower for the <lb/>Denisova genome, but still significant, especially for Asian segments. Furthermore, as can be seen <lb/>in Figure 9, more IBD segments are found that match the Neandertal genome than segments that <lb/>match the Denisova genome. One explanation for this is that the unknown ancient gene flow into <lb/>Denisovans mentioned by Prüfer et al. (35) replaced some segments from the common ancestor of <lb/>Neandertals and Denisovans in the Denisova genome. Therefore, these segments are only shared <lb/>by modern humans and Neandertals although they might have been introduced by the aforemen-<lb/>tioned common ancestor. <lb/>Next we wanted to know which populations share an IBD segment that matches a particular <lb/>genome, that is, we asked whether this IBD segment is found in this population or not. Figure 10 <lb/>shows for each genome (human and ancient) and each IBD segment, whether a population shares <lb/>this IBD segment or not. IBD segments that match the Neandertal or the Archaic genome are <lb/>found more often in Asians and Europeans than all IBD segments (human genome). This effect is <lb/>not as prominent for IBD segments that match the Denisova genome, but still significant. <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2.2 Densities of Population Proportions and Ancient Genomes <lb/>We plotted densities of population proportions for IBD segments that match a particular ancient <lb/>genome (30% or more SNVs match) and for those that do not match that genome. Figure 11 <lb/>shows the density of Asian proportions of Denisova-matching IBD segments (pink) vs. the density <lb/>of Asian proportions of non-Denisova-matching IBD segments (cyan). Figure 12 shows analo-<lb/>gous densities for Europeans. In comparison to all populations the density of Denisova-matching <lb/>IBD segments that are observed in Asians and Europeans is higher than for non-matching IBD <lb/>segments. This can be seen by the higher densities of matching IBD segments (pink) compared to <lb/>densities of non-matching IBD segments (cyan) if the population proportions are not very close to <lb/>zero -or, conversely, it can be seen at the lower peak at zero (less IBD segments that match the <lb/>Denisova genome without Asian or European sharing). Many Denisova-matching IBD segments <lb/>are shared exclusively among Asians which is indicated by the high density at a population pro-<lb/>portion of 1 (pink density in Figure 11). Population proportion of 1 means that IBD segments are <lb/>only shared among Asians. <lb/>Figures 14 and 15 show analogous densities as in Figures 11 and 12, but for the Neandertal <lb/>genome. The differences we already observed for the Denisova genome are even more prominent <lb/>for the Neandertal: Neandertal-matching IBD segments are observed even more often in Asians <lb/>and Europeans than non-matching IBD segments if compared to all segments of the respective <lb/>category. The higher densities (pink) at a population proportion not close to zero are now more <lb/>prominent -or conversely, the lower peak at zero for Neandertal-matching IBD segments be-<lb/>comes clearer (less IBD segments that match the Neandertal genome without Asian or European <lb/>sharing). For Asians, the peak at 1 in Figure 14 is even higher, representing IBD segments that <lb/>are shared exclusively among Asians. IBD segment sharing exclusively within one continental <lb/>population is very common, as the blue peaks at 1 in Figure 11 and Figure 14 show. <lb/>Figures 13 and 16 show the same densities for Africans. Both the density of African propor-<lb/>tions of Denisova-matching and the same density for Neandertal-matching IBD segments have <lb/>two peaks: one at a low and one at a high proportion of Africans. For Neandertal-matching IBD <lb/>segments, the density at low proportions of Africans is even larger than for high proportions. Thus, <lb/>IBD segments that match ancient genomes are either shared by a very low or a very high proportion <lb/>of Africans. The low proportion of African density peak hints at admixture of ancestors of modern <lb/>humans and Denisovans / Neandertals outside of Africa or the back to Africa gene flow mentioned <lb/>by Prüfer et al. (35). The density peak at high proportions of Africans may be due to ancient DNA <lb/>segments shared by hominid groups that were lost in other continental populations. This finding <lb/>could support the hypothesis that ancient population substructure in Africa also allowed for the <lb/>occurrence of different continental patterns of DNA sharing between modern humans and ancient <lb/>genomes (10, 15). <lb/>IBD segments that match the &quot;Archaic genome&quot; are those IBD segments that match both the <lb/>Denisova and Neandertal genome. Population proportion densities for the Archaic genome are <lb/>presented in Figures 17, 18, and 19 for Asians, Europeans, and Africans, respectively. For the <lb/>Archaic genome we see the same figure as for the Neandertal and the Denisova genome: the <lb/>African density is bimodal that means either it is dominated by Africans or it contains no or only <lb/>few Africans. <lb/></body>

			<body>4 Analyses of Lengths of IBD Segments <lb/>4.1 Relating the IBD Length to Years from Present <lb/>We aim to establish a relation between the length of an IBD segment and the time of the most <lb/>recent common ancestor of the individuals that possess the IBD segment. The shorter the IBD <lb/>segment is, the older it is assumed to be, the further in the past the most recent common ancestor <lb/>should be found. For IBD length distributions, mathematical models have already been estab-<lb/>lished. However, these models assume IBD segment sharing between only two individuals. <lb/>4.1.1 Exponential Distributed IBD Lengths <lb/>The length of an IBD segment is exponentially distributed with a mean of 100/(2g) cM (centi-<lb/>Morgans), where g is the number of generations which separate the two haplotypes that share a <lb/>segment from their common ancestor (4, 16, 34, 50, 51). Ulgen and Li (52) recommend to use <lb/>a recombination rate, cM-to-Mbp ratio, of 1, however it varies from 0 to 9 along a chromosome <lb/>(57). <lb/>We are not able to perform reliable age estimations of the IBD segments based on their <lb/>length. <lb/>We encountered severe problems in estimating the age of IBD segments based on their length: <lb/>The original ancestor DNA sequence is assumed to have a length of 1 Morgan before it is <lb/>broken up by recombinations. However, founder genomes cannot be assumed to be distin-<lb/>guishable across the length of 1 Morgan. <lb/>It is assumed that recombinations are random and all resulting segments have the same <lb/>chance to survive. However, e.g. after population admixture or introgression of ancient <lb/>genomes into ancestors of humans, recombined segments may have different fitness and <lb/>some may vanish due to the high selective pressure. Thus, after such events the selective <lb/>pressure leads to a bias of the IBD length distribution which makes the estimation of their <lb/>age intractable. <lb/>The age estimations are based on the mean, thus it is assumed that there are enough re-<lb/>combination events in each generation to average out random effects. Therefore, for few <lb/>admixture/introgression events (few matings/offspring) these estimations are not reliable. <lb/>Due to these problems, we do not present age estimation at this point of our investigation. <lb/>4.1.2 Correction for the Assumptions of IBD Length Distributions <lb/>The IBD length distribution was derived from sharing between two individuals, but we consider <lb/>IBD sharing among many individuals and compute the raw IBD segment length as the maximal <lb/>IBD sharing of any two individuals that possess the IBD segment. This results in overestimation <lb/>of the lengths, because it is the maximum of all pairwise sharings. We also observed a second <lb/>cause for raw IBD segments being longer than expected by the exponential distribution. The more <lb/></body>

			<body>individuals share an IBD segment, the more likely it is to find two individuals that share random <lb/>minor alleles which would falsely extend the IBD segment. <lb/>Therefore, we corrected the raw lengths of IBD segments by locating the first tagSNV from <lb/>the left (upstream) which is shared by at least 3/4 of the individuals that possess the IBD segment. <lb/>This tagSNV is the left break point for the IBD segment. Analogously, we determined the right <lb/>break point by the first tagSNV from the right (downstream) that is shared by at least 3/4 of the <lb/>individuals. The distance between these break points is the (corrected) length of an IBD segment. <lb/>4.1.3 Length Correction for IBD with Ancient Genomes <lb/>We are interested in IBD between modern human and ancient genomes. However, the human IBD <lb/>segment length is not an appropriate measure for the length of IBD with ancient genomes because <lb/>only a part of the IBD segment may match an ancient genome (see Figure 33). <lb/>We corrected the IBD segment lengths to obtain the IBD lengths between human and ancient <lb/>genomes. The corrected length of an IBD segment is the length of the &quot;ancient part&quot; that matches <lb/>a particular ancient genome. This &quot;ancient part&quot; must contain at least 8 tagSNVs, which is the <lb/>minimum number of tagSNVs per IBD segments. First, the left (upstream) break point of the <lb/>&quot;ancient part&quot; of an IBD segment genome is detected. This left break point was defined as the first <lb/>location in the IBD segment from the left (upstream), where at least 4 out of 8 tagSNVs match <lb/>the ancient genome. From the right (downstream), the right break point of the &quot;ancient part&quot; of an <lb/>IBD segment was detected analogously. Since not all bases of the ancient genomes were called, <lb/>we modified the definition of the break points and required at least 6 bases of the 8 tagSNVs to be <lb/>called of which 3, have to match the ancient genome. If either the left or right break point of an <lb/>&quot;ancient part&quot; could not be found, then this IBD segment does not contain an &quot;ancient part&quot; and <lb/>was excluded from all further analyses. <lb/>Matching of an IBD segment and an ancient genome for IBD segment lengths analyses was <lb/>defined as: <lb/>1. at least 15% of the tagSNVs of the IBD segment must match the ancient genome, <lb/>2. the &quot;ancient part&quot; of the IBD segment must contain at least 8 tagSNVs, and <lb/>3. 30% of the tagSNVs in the &quot;ancient part&quot; of the IBD segment must match the ancient <lb/>genome. <lb/>4.2 Histograms of Lengths of IBD Segments for the Different Genomes <lb/>Figure 20 shows the histograms of IBD segment lengths for all IBD segments (human genome) <lb/>and for IBD segments that match the Neandertal genome. For the human genome a peak at 24,200 <lb/>bp is visible, whereas, for the Neandertal genome, peaks are at 6,000 and 22,000 bp. It can be <lb/>seen that IBD segments that match the Neandertal genome are shorter, thus also older. <lb/>Figure 21 shows the histograms of IBD segment lengths for all IBD segments that match <lb/>the Denisova and the &quot;Archaic&quot; genome (&quot;Archaic genome&quot; contains IBD segments that match <lb/>both the Denisova and Neandertal genome).

			<body>Archaic genome are almost at the same positions as the corresponding peaks for the Denisova <lb/>and Neandertal genome. IBD segment sharing between humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans <lb/>may have two different reasons. First, the IBD segments may stem from a common ancestor and <lb/>are passed on in each of these hominid groups. Secondly, IBD segment sharing may be caused <lb/>by an introgression of one hominid group into another. For the former the IBD segments are <lb/>supposed to be on average shorter than for the latter scenario. Therefore, the peaks at shortest, and <lb/>hence oldest, IBD segments must be assumed to stem from a common ancestor of Neandertals and <lb/>Denisovans. Some of these IBD segments may have been lost either in Neandertals or Denisovans <lb/>(at least in the specimens analyzed) and are therefore not attributed to the Archaic genome but to <lb/>one of the other two groups. Introgression of Neandertals into the Denisova genome or vice versa <lb/>and a subsequent gene flow into humans can explain long, therefore more recent, IBD segments <lb/>that are attributed to the Archaic genome. This hypothesis is supported by the results of Prüfer et <lb/>al. (35) which show evidence of Neandertal gene flow into Denisovans. <lb/>4.3 IBD Segment Lengths of Human Populations <lb/>Figure 22 shows the density of the lengths of IBD segments that are private to Asians vs. the <lb/>density of the lengths of IBD segments that are private to Europeans. Since IBD segments are <lb/>private to each continental population, the densities are based on disjoint IBD segment sets. Both <lb/>show three peaks at similar lengths. Asians show a global peak at 26,500 bp, while Europeans <lb/>show a global peak at 25,300 bp. The other peaks are around 21,000 bp and 49,000 bp. For Asians <lb/>the peak at 49,000 bp is larger than for Europeans resulting in a lower global peak. <lb/>Figure 23A shows the density of lengths of IBD segments that are private to Asians vs. lengths <lb/>of IBD segments that are only shared between Asians and Africans. Figure 23B shows the same <lb/>plot for Europeans instead of Asians. A small difference is visible in the global peaks of length <lb/>distributions of IBD segments that are private to a continental population and those shared with <lb/>Africans (blue dashed lines): 26,500 vs. 19,000 bp for Asians and 25,300 vs. 23,500 bp for <lb/>Europeans. Segments that are also shared with Africans show an enrichment at shorter lengths <lb/>compared to segments that are private to either Asians or Europeans. <lb/>Figure 24A shows the density of lengths of IBD segments that are private to Asians vs. lengths <lb/>of IBD segments that are shared between Asians, Europeans, and Africans. Figure 24B shows the <lb/>same plot for Europeans instead of Asians. Of course, the peaks for Asians and Europeans are the <lb/>same as in Figure 23. Again segments that are shared by all three continental populations show an <lb/>enrichment at shorter lengths compared to segments that are private to either Asians or Europeans. <lb/>We already assumed that IBD segments that are shared by all population groups predate the Out-<lb/>of-Africa split and therefore have to be very old. These results confirm our assumptions since we <lb/>show that these segments are very short. <lb/>Next we investigated the effect on the length distribution if IBD segments are removed that <lb/>are shared by Africans. Figure 25A shows the density of lengths of IBD segments that are private <lb/>to Asians vs. the density of IBD segment lengths shared by Asians and Europeans, but not by <lb/>Africans. In Figure 25B, the same plot as in Figure 25A is shown, but now compared to IBD <lb/>segments that are private to Europeans. In Figure 24A and B, the density for IBD segments that <lb/>are shared with Africans, has high values for shorter IBD segments (blue). In Figure 25A and <lb/>B, this range of high values vanishes, because IBD segments that are shared with Africans are <lb/>removed. A higher density region at longer segment length becomes visible for IBD segments that <lb/></body>

The length density of all IBD <lb/>segments has a peak at 25,000 bp, while the length distribution of IBD with the Denisova genome <lb/>has a peak at 5,000 bp.

This hints at <lb/>introgression from the Neandertals into anatomically modern humans that were the ancestors of <lb/>Europeans and Asians after these humans left Africa. The higher density of short IBD segments <lb/>which are prominent in Africans in the range of 5,000-15,000 bp hints at old DNA segments that <lb/>humans share with the Neandertal genome. Again our results contradict the hypothesis of Prüfer <lb/>et al.

Figure 29A <lb/>shows densities of lengths of IBD segments that match the Neandertal genome and are private <lb/>to a population.

Asians have density peaks at 26,000 bp and 41,000 bp. The densities of Asians and <lb/>Europeans agree well with each other. They have peaks at longer segment lengths compared to <lb/>Africans. Therefore, we were interested in IBD segments that match the Neandertal genome and <lb/>that are private to Africans and those which are not observed in Africans hence shared by either <lb/>Asians or Europeans or both. Figure 29B shows densities of lengths of IBD segments that match <lb/>the Neandertal genome and are private to Africans vs. IBD segments that are not observed in <lb/>Africans. The peak for Africans is around 5,000 bp, while IBD segments that are not observed in <lb/>Africans have a global length density peak at 25,000 bp and smaller peaks at 14,000 bp and 41,000 <lb/>bp.

Panel <lb/>B: Densities of lengths of IBD segments that match the Neandertal genome and are private to <lb/>Africans vs. IBD segments that are not observed in Africans. The peak for Africans is around <lb/>5,000 bp, while IBD segments that are not observed in Africans have a global length density peak <lb/>at 25,000 and smaller peaks at 14,000 bp and 41,000 bp. Most prominently, non-African IBD <lb/>segments that match the Neandertal genome are enriched in regions of longer segment lengths <lb/>(blue density). <lb/>4.4.3 Lengths of IBD Segments that Match Neandertal &amp; Denisova <lb/>IBD segments that match the &quot;Archaic genome&quot; are IBD segments that match both the Neandertal <lb/>and the Denisova genome. Segments matching the Archaic genome stem either from a genome of <lb/>archaic hominids which were ancestors of Neandertals and Denisovans or they stem from intro-<lb/>gression of one hominid group into another. Garrigan et al. (12) were the first to present evidence <lb/>for a prolonged period of ancestral population subdivision followed by relatively recent interbreed-<lb/>ing in the history of human populations. Later, Wall et al. (54) found evidence that suggests that <lb/>admixture between diverged hominid groups may have been a common feature of human evolu-<lb/>tion. Recently Prüfer et al. (35) published findings that suggest gene flow from Neandertals into <lb/>Denisovans as well as an additional ancestral component in Denisovans from an unknown ancient <lb/>population. <lb/>Figure 30A shows the density of the lengths of all IBD segments (human genome) vs. the <lb/>density of the lengths of IBD segments that match the Archaic genome. For the human genome, <lb/>the global density peak is again at 25,000 bp. For IBD with the Archaic genome, the global density <lb/>peak is at 6,000 bp, but smaller peak at 15,500 bp and 24,500 bp can be observed. Figure 30B <lb/>shows densities of lengths of IBD segments that match the Archaic genome and are enriched in <lb/>a particular continental population. The global density peak for all populations as well as for <lb/>Africans can be seen around 6,000 bp. Europeans and Asians have peaks around 9,000 bp, 16,000 <lb/>bp, 26,000 bp, and 42,000 bp. Similar to IBD segments matching the Denisova or Neandertal <lb/>genome separately, segments shared by Europeans or Asians are longer than segments shared by <lb/></body>

			<body>6 Conclusion <lb/>We applied HapFABIA to the 1000 Genomes Project data to extract very short identity by descent <lb/>(IBD) segments and analyzed the IBD sharing patterns of human populations, Neandertals, and <lb/>Denisovans. <lb/>Some IBD segments are shared with (1) the reconstructed ancestral genome of humans and <lb/>other primates, (2) the Neandertal genome, and/or (3) the Denisova genome. We could confirm an <lb/>introgression from Denisovans into ancestors of Asians after their migration out of Africa. Further-<lb/>more, IBD sharing hints at a gene flow from Neandertals into ancestors of Asians and Europeans <lb/>after they left Africa (to a larger extend into ancestors of Asians). Interestingly, many Neandertal-<lb/>or Denisova-matching IBD segments are predominantly observed in Africans -some of them <lb/>even exclusively. IBD segments shared between Africans and Neandertals or Denisovans are <lb/>strikingly short, therefore we assume that they are very old. This may indicate that these segments <lb/>stem from ancestors of humans, Neandertals, and Denisovans and have survived in Africans. <lb/>In the near future the 1000 Genomes Project will be completed by genome sequences from <lb/>additional populations, the UK10K project extents the subset of European genomes, and, most <lb/>importantly, more ancient genomes will be successfully sequenced (Ust-Ishim, El Sidrón, etc.). <lb/>Therefore, we expect that the analysis of the population structure by sharing patterns of very short <lb/>IBD segments will become an increasingly important method in population genetics and its results <lb/>will become more and more fine-grained. <lb/></body>

			<div type="annex">Appendices <lb/>A Are Rare Variants Recent or Old? <lb/>Rare variants are found to be old which might seem to contradict results of other researchers. <lb/>However, the conclusion that rare variants are, in general, recent does not contradict our re-<lb/>sults. On the contrary, that the majority of IBD segments extracted by HapFABIA is found in <lb/>Africans can explain why three times as many variants with 0.5-5% minor allele frequency are <lb/>found in Africans as in Europeans or Asians in the 1000 Genomes Project (48). In particular, <lb/>if rare variants are caused by a recent population growth, then the numbers found by the 1000 <lb/>Genomes Project (48) are difficult to interpret. We want to discuss two reasons why rare variants <lb/>may be old. <lb/>(I) Many rare variants are old, however, most rare variants may be recent, e.g. because of a <lb/>recent growth in population. We did not consider private variants and have a bias toward less <lb/>rare variants because, the more individuals share an IBD segment, the higher its significance, <lb/>the more likely it is detected by HapFABIA. In our analysis, only 39% of the rare variants (not <lb/>counting private variants) are in IBD segments. Therefore, the remaining majority of rare and <lb/>private variants might be recent. <lb/>The vast majority of IBD segments is found in Africans. This would explain why Africans <lb/>have more rare and low-frequency variants than Europeans or Asians. The publication of the 1000 <lb/>Genomes Project (48) reports: <lb/>&quot;individuals from populations with substantial African ancestry (YRI, LWK and ASW) <lb/>carry up to three times as many low-frequency variants (0.5-5% frequency) as those <lb/>of European or East Asian origin,&quot; <lb/>Table S14 in the supplementary information of the publication of the 1000 Genomes Project (48) <lb/>provides the number of derived variants per individual in each population in its last rows (DAF <lb/>denotes &quot;derived allele frequency&quot;, i.e. the frequency of the mutation): <lb/>African <lb/>European <lb/>ASW <lb/>LWK <lb/>YRI <lb/>CEU <lb/>FIN <lb/>GBR <lb/>IBS <lb/>TSI <lb/>DAF &lt;0.5% 116,216 152,267 122,978 <lb/>30,034 <lb/>32,918 <lb/>31,944 <lb/>36,129 <lb/>33,425 <lb/>DAF 0.5-5% 558,996 649,303 683,239 143,987 146,737 146,802 155,270 146,066 <lb/>Asian <lb/>Admixed American <lb/>CHB <lb/>CHS <lb/>JPT <lb/>CLM <lb/>MXL <lb/>PUR <lb/>DAF &lt;0.5% <lb/>36,081 <lb/>40,974 <lb/>45,107 <lb/>45,184 <lb/>38,654 <lb/>48,892 <lb/>DAF 0.5-5% 119,668 118,137 120,115 189,257 163,737 214,430 <lb/>Recent variants are supposed to be derived variants.

			<div type="annex">(II) Many rare variants are old, however, compared to common SNPs, they are recent, i.e. the <lb/>temporal relations remain, but variants are dated further back. We state in the manuscript that <lb/>many rare variants are old and from times before humans migrated out of Africa. However, many <lb/>common SNPs are even older and stem from common ancestors of human and chimpanzee. This <lb/>means that many rare variants are old, but compared to common SNPs they are recent. <lb/>The fact that common SNPs are old is supported by findings of the Chimpanzee Consortium. In <lb/>Hacia et al. (17) it was found that, of 397 human SNP sites, 214 were ancestral (shared with <lb/>common ancestors of chimpanzee and human). Of the ancestral SNPs, 1/4 had the minor allele as <lb/>ancestral allele. For the chimpanzee genome (49), it was found that <lb/>&quot;Of ∼7.2 million SNPs mapped to the human genome in the current public database, <lb/>we could assign the alleles as ancestral or derived in 80% of the cases according to <lb/>which allele agrees with the chimpanzee genome sequence&quot; <lb/>and that <lb/>&quot;a significant proportion of derived alleles have high frequencies: 9.1% of derived <lb/>alleles have frequency ≥ 80%.&quot; <lb/>According to (49, Suppl. Fig. S9) about 25% of the derived alleles have frequency ≥ 50% in <lb/>which case the minor allele is the ancestral allele. <lb/>That some SNPs are very old and that some haplotypes are shared between humans and chim-<lb/>panzee was also found in Leffler et al. (26): <lb/>&quot;We conducted a genome-wide scan for long-lived balancing selection by looking <lb/>for combinations of SNPs shared between humans and chimpanzees. In addition to <lb/>the major histocompatibility complex, we identified 125 regions in which the same <lb/>haplotypes are segregating in the two species,&quot; <lb/>In a recent publication (11), it was found that <lb/>&quot;The average age across all SNVs was 34,200 ± 900 years (± s.d.) in European <lb/>Americans and 47,600 ± 1,500 years in African Americans, and these estimates were <lb/>robust to sequencing errors [...]&quot;. <lb/> The authors further write <lb/>&quot;SNVs shared between European Americans and African Americans were signifi-<lb/>cantly older (104,400 years and 115,800 years for European Americans and African <lb/>Americans, respectively)&quot;. <lb/>These figures are visualized as bar plots in Figure 39. <lb/></div>
