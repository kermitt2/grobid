			<body>Introduction <lb/>The vast majority of genetic association studies focus on one trait at a time. Even when more <lb/>than one trait has been measured, separate analyses are usually conducted for each trait. For <lb/>example, van der Harst [1] characterized a human population for six related red blood cell <lb/>phenotypes by testing for association in each phenotype independently. Even studies of <lb/>transcriptome abundances that sample thousands of RNAs [2] usually analyze them individually. <lb/>In other cases, the dimension of multivariate data is first reduced by principal components <lb/>analysis, and scores on the trait combinations that define a PC are then analyzed independently <lb/>[e.g., 3]. There is increasing interest in inferring joint effects on more than one trait to <lb/>characterize pleiotropy [4-6], although in many cases this has been accomplished by reanalysis <lb/>of the results of univariate analyses [e.g., 7,8,9]. Such analyses are actually biased against <lb/>discovering pleiotropy, as the associations must meet strict univariate criteria for significance <lb/>before being considered for testing [6]. <lb/>A truly multivariate analysis, where a single data set is analyzed simultaneously for the <lb/>relationship between m genetic markers (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and k <lb/>traits, offers several advantages over such reanalyses of univariate associations. First, it is <lb/>efficient in the number of tests, as each SNP is subjected to a single analysis, rather than k <lb/>analyses. Second, multivariate tests are more powerful than sets of univariate tests as they <lb/>locate those directions of phenotype space that maximize phenotypic differences among <lb/>predictors, regardless of their orientation relative to the phenotypic measurements. Third, <lb/>multivariate analyses estimate the direction of effects in phenotype space. This enables <lb/>quantitative interpretation of the sources of covariation among the measured variables. It also <lb/>provides a quantitative basis for validation of results in later studies. <lb/>While a small number of such truly multivariate genome-wide analyses have been <lb/>published [e.g., 10,11], the potential advantages of such analyses have received relatively little <lb/>attention. Statisticians have adapted a variety of multivariate statistical approaches to <lb/>multivariate association studies [6,12,13], but with few exceptions [e.g., 14,15], most have <lb/>tended to focus on problematic aspects of large data sets, such as dealing with missing values, <lb/>generalizing to non-normally distributed data, or including mixtures of continuous and <lb/>categorical phenotypes, than on the performance of simple multivariate analyses. <lb/>The opportunity for such multivariate analyses is certain to grow for several reasons. First <lb/>of all, there is recognition that understanding the genotype-phenotype map is an inherently <lb/>multivariate problem. The totality of genetic effects on the phenotype as a whole is what shapes <lb/>its evolutionary, medical and economic significance. This has led to increasing emphasis on <lb/>phenomics, high-throughput acquisition of multivariate phenotypic data to complement our <lb/>ability to measure genomes [16]. Second, there are now many efforts underway to generate and <lb/>phenotypically characterize replicable sets of genotypes in a variety of model organisms [e.g., <lb/>17,18,19], greatly increasing the number of datasets where a truly multivariate analysis can be <lb/>undertaken. Complementary efforts in humans aim to increase the comprehensiveness of <lb/>phenotyping efforts [e.g., 20,21] and to increase the sizes of cohorts studied [e.g., 22]. <lb/>Our purpose in this contribution is to explore the statistical properties of multivariate <lb/>genome-wide association mapping through simulation when the true dimensionality of genetic <lb/>effects is not known. To understand our approach, we need to define our use of the term <lb/>dimensionality. Dimensionality is the number of independent aspects of the phenotype that are <lb/>affected by genetic variation in the suite of traits measured. Independence is defined <lb/>geometrically as orthogonal directions in the space of all measured traits. For example, imagine <lb/>that the measured traits are the length and width of some morphological structure. Clearly if <lb/>genetic variation in the population affects only length or only width, then the true dimension of <lb/>variation (d) is one. Critically, if all genetic changes affected length and width in the same way -<lb/>say changing length twice the amount that width is changed -d remains one, even though two <lb/>traits are affected by each mutation. When different genetic variants affect length and width in <lb/>different ways, then the true dimension of variation is at least d=2. While the true <lb/>dimensionality can be less than the number of traits measured, we have to measure at least d <lb/>traits to test the hypothesis that the dimensionality of variation is at least d. Critically, length and <lb/>
            width can be correlated, yet measuring both adds information that allows that second orthogonal <lb/>dimension of variation to be assessed. In general, each of the d dimensions will be defined by <lb/>some combination of the characteristics measured. Our definition of dimensionality generalizes <lb/>more conventional usages such as &quot;correlated traits,&quot; as it emphasizes conditionally independent <lb/>directions of genetic variation, over specific measurements (such as length and width), which an <lb/>investigator chooses to measure. <lb/>It is clear that multivariate analysis will be greatly superior when genetic variants can <lb/>have any possible combination of effects on the phenotype [14,15], that is, when the <lb/>dimensionality is as large as the number of measured phenotypes, and includes all possible <lb/>direction in the space of measured phenotypes. However, it is possible to measure more <lb/>phenotypes than the true genetic dimensionality, and thus include phenotypic measurements that <lb/>do not contribute independent information about genetic causation. Consequently, we need to <lb/>consider not just the benefits of measuring more traits when the true dimensionality is high, but <lb/>also the costs of analyzing too many phenotypes when the true dimensionality is low. We <lb/>restrict our attention to the case of multivariate normal phenotype distributions that can be <lb/>analyzed by standard multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA). <lb/>We present results of two sets of simulations to address the properties of MANOVA of <lb/>high dimensional data for association mapping. Our first set of simulations examines the effect <lb/>of trait dimensionality on statistical performance of single-locus tests for the ideal case where <lb/>linkage (gametic) disequilibrium (LD) is absent. This focuses attention on how multivariate <lb/>analyses might be different from univariate ones. Second, we explore the statistical <lb/>consequences of LD by simulating phenotypic variation caused by one of a set of correlated <lb/>SNPs. Our findings display the widely reported statistical challenges posed by genome-wide <lb/>analyses in general, but clearly demonstrate that increasing the number of phenotypes usually <lb/>leads to an increase in statistical power. <lb/>Simulation Methods <lb/>The primary aim of these simulations is to create k-dimensional phenotypic data with known <lb/>causal associations to a SNP data set. We consider the simple case of a set of traits that follow a <lb/>multivariate normal distribution, so that a standard multivariate analysis of variance is <lb/>appropriate. The parameters of our simulations were based on the properties of the Drosophila <lb/>Genome Reference Panel [DGRP; 19], a set of inbred lines derived from a single outbred <lb/>population of Drosophila melanogaster. This population has been used for both published and <lb/>ongoing association mapping efforts. <lb/>Genotype information <lb/>We used Freeze 1 genotype calls (ftp://ftp.hgsc.bcm.edu/DGRP/freeze1_July_2010/snp_calls/) <lb/>for a subset of 164 DGRP lines as the basis for our simulations. Details of the SNP calling can be <lb/>found in Mackay et al. (2012). We used only calls of homozygous genotypes at sites with <lb/>exactly two alternative types. All other calls were treated as missing data. There were 2,489,796 <lb/>sequenced sites where the count of the minor allele was at least 3, and the number of non-<lb/>missing calls was at least 61. We further filtered these sites for local gametic (linkage) <lb/>disequilibrium by calculating the correlation of genotypic identities between all sites within 20 <lb/>polymorphic sites along each chromosome. For pairs of sites with r 2 &gt; 0.8, we dropped the site <lb/>with the greater number of missing calls, and when these were the same, dropped the site with <lb/>the lowest minor allele count. In practice, every dropped site proved to be perfectly correlated <lb/>(r 2 = 1) with at least one included site. After this site selection step, 1,541,611 sites remained. <lb/>The median allele frequency was p=0.121, and the median number of lines scored at each SNP <lb/>was 160. <lb/>Simulating phenotypic effects in the absence of LD <lb/>For the simulations constructed without LD, we generated m = 10,000 random arrays of allelic <lb/>values whose minor allele counts (MAC) and number of lines with missing genotype data were <lb/>sampled randomly from the Freeze 1 DGRP sites. To ensure that LD was random, we randomly <lb/>assigned SNP genotypes and missing values to lines. A subset of SNPs were randomly chosen to <lb/>cause simulated effects, and thus contribute to the genetic variance among simulated genotypes. <lb/>Following Storey and Tibishirani [23], we denote the fraction of loci that do not have an effect as <lb/>π0, so that the total number of sites with a real effect is m1 = m (1-π0). <lb/>The directions of SNP effects were based on the among-line variance-covariance matrix <lb/>G, derived from the positions of 48 landmark and semi-landmark points on the wings of female <lb/>specimens from 164 DGRP lines (N=3,635). We defined our traits to be the first 59 non-null <lb/>eigenvectors (the theoretical maximum number of independent traits in our data), resulting in a <lb/>diagonal covariance matrix Ĝ . Thus, our simulated multivariate traits have simple factor <lb/>structure, with each ordered dimension capturing a progressively smaller proportion of the total <lb/>genetic variance. We assumed that a proportion u of the genetic effects captured in Ĝ were not <lb/>caused by any of the SNPs in our sample, while the remaining 1-u was. For these simulations, <lb/>we held u constant at 0.1. We then partitioned Ĝ into two orthogonal complementary <lb/>subspaces, namely <lb/>  1 <lb/>u <lb/> <lb/>LG , which parameterizes the contribution due to known SNPs, and <lb/>û <lb/> <lb/>res <lb/>LG , which models other genotypic effects. <lb/>To generate SNP effects, we randomly sampled m1 multivariate normal effect vectors, Sj <lb/>with mean vector 0 and covariance parameter matrix L. We then normalized the Sj vectors and <lb/>assigned each a magnitude gj, sampled from an exponential distribution with mean 1. The total <lb/>effects of all SNPs in line i is then <lb/>ij j j <lb/>j a g S <lb/> <lb/>, where aij denotes the allele for genotype i at <lb/>locus j, valued 0 if it corresponds to the major allele and 1 if it equals the minor allele. For the <lb/>purposes of computing genotype means, we imputed missing alleles a random value (0 or 1). To <lb/>maintain comparability across simulations, we scaled the effect size parameter g so that the trace <lb/>of the simulated covariance matrix matched the trace of L, using, <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>tr <lb/>tr cov <lb/>j <lb/>j <lb/>ij j j <lb/>j <lb/>i <lb/>gg <lb/>a g S <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>L <lb/>[1] <lb/>where tr and cov denote the trace and covariance matrix operators. Constraining simulated <lb/>covariance matrices to account for a constant variance holds the proportion of variation <lb/>accounted for by all SNPs constant, regardless of the number of sites causing that variation. This <lb/>means that the proportion of variance explained by each SNP is larger in simulations with fewer <lb/>causal SNPs. We ran simulations based on high-and low-power scenarios, assuming, <lb/>respectively, m1 =100 (π0 = 0.99) and m1 = 3000 (π0 = 0.70) causal SNPs. Figures S1 and S2 <lb/>show, respectively, typical distributions of effect sizes and per SNP explained variance simulated <lb/>under these power scenarios. <lb/>To generate unexplained genetic differences among lines, we randomly sampled a <lb/>vector, Ui, from a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector 0 and covariance matrix Lres <lb/>for each of the N inbred genotypes. We drew samples of Ui repeatedly until we obtained a set <lb/>where the covariance matrix of these effects, U, satisfied tr(Lres)-tr(U) &lt; ε. We set ε=10 -6 . <lb/>The mean phenotype of the ith line, Yi, is the sum of all these genetic effects <lb/>i <lb/>i <lb/>ij j j <lb/>j <lb/>Y U <lb/>a g S <lb/> <lb/>   <lb/>, i = 1,…,N; j = 1, …, m1 <lb/>[2] <lb/>Finally, we simulated samples of n = 40 individuals within genotypes by drawing random <lb/>vectors from a multivariate normal distribution with mean i <lb/>Y and covariance matrix E computed <lb/>by subtracting G from the pooled within-line covariance matrix (P). The structure of the L and <lb/>E matrices parameterized from DGRP data have the relatively even eigenvalue distributions <lb/>expected for morphometric data [16]. The maximum eigenvalues of L and E are 1.18 and 0.33, <lb/>respectively, and the slopes from regressing logarithm of eigenvalues on d are βL = -0.07 and βE <lb/>= -0.05. Each successive eigenvalue is on average 85% of the previous eigenvalue for the <lb/>
            among-line variation, and 89% of the previous eigenvalue in the unexplained matrix. <lb/>Consequently, genetic variation drops more sharply at higher dimensions than unexplained <lb/>variation does, resulting in a steady decline of heritability (h 2 ) with dimensionality (see Fig. S4). <lb/>Simulating phenotypic effects with disequilibrium <lb/>To include the effect of LD in simulations, we designed a sampling scheme that would allow us <lb/>to isolate the biasing impact of correlations among SNPs on the probability that a null SNP is <lb/>declared significant (i.e., false positives) by virtue of its correlation to a true SNP, whether the <lb/>latter is declared significant (i.e., true positive) or not (i.e., false negative). To generate correlated <lb/>SNPs, we drew samples of SNP genotypes directly from the filtered Freeze 1 DGRP sequences. <lb/>To ensure an even representation of allelic frequencies, we ranked all sites by their minor allele <lb/>frequency (MAF), and then sampled focal SNPs from within each MAF decile at random. We <lb/>identified all SNPs genome-wide whose gametic correlation with each focal SNP satisfies r &gt; <lb/>0.5, and denote the resulting set as a &quot;SNP family.&quot; We retained for analysis 100 families with at <lb/>least two members (the focal SNP and at least one other) from each MAF decile. The mean and <lb/>median number of SNPs/family was 169 and 14 respectively. In cases where the focal SNP was <lb/>correlated at r &gt; 0.5 with more than 100 SNPs (31% of all focal SNPs), we retained a random <lb/>sample of 100 correlated SNPs. <lb/>To isolate the impact of LD in the presence of an effect, we carried out paired simulations <lb/>where either the focal SNP in a family was assigned a phenotypic effect, or none of the SNPs in <lb/>the family had phenotypic effects. In these simulations each effect explains 1% of the among-<lb/>line variance, with the remainder left unexplained (u = 0.99). Simulations were otherwise <lb/>performed as described in the absence of LD. This allowed us to precisely quantify the statistical <lb/>impact of a genetic effect in a sample of correlated SNPs. <lb/>Dimensionality <lb/>True dimensionality, d, is the number of dimensions of the space in which genetic effects on the <lb/>phenotype arise. We wanted to explore the implications of the number of measurements <lb/>analyzed, k, in relation to d. Our diagonal covariance parameter matrix Ĝ spans the entire 59-<lb/>dimensional space of possible genetic variation. To generate a d-dimensional parameter <lb/>covariance matrix ˆd <lb/>G , we simply set the bottom 59-d diagonal elements of Ĝ to 0. Thus, the d-<lb/>dimensional subspace retained is always the subspace that contains the most phenotypic <lb/>variance. This procedure is conservative with respect to the usefulness of a multivariate <lb/>approach, because the first dimension always captures more of the genetic variance than any <lb/>other dimension, and our univariate analyses are of this one most informative trait. Finally, to <lb/>avoid confounding differences in dimensionality and total variance across simulations, the total <lb/>variance captured in the first d dimensions is rescaled to match the trace of Ĝ , by multiplying <lb/>each element of ˆd <lb/>G by     <lb/>ˆtr <lb/>tr d <lb/>GG . Note that phenotypic data are in all cases measured in <lb/>the original 59-dimensional space, where the bottom 59-d dimensions contain non-genetic <lb/>residual variation, as described by E. <lb/>Analysis <lb/>We used MANOVA (for k &gt; 1 simulations) and ANOVA (for k = 1 simulations) to test for <lb/>genomic associations, with SNP genotype as the sole predictor variable and k (= 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, <lb/>30, 40, 50, and 59) shape traits as response variables. MANOVA P-values were calculated using <lb/>a chi-square approximation of Wilk&apos;s Lambda, whereas F-ratios were used for ANOVAs. We <lb/>also ran an additional set of simulations for the case where d=59 based on k univariate tests. In <lb/>these tests, a SNP was declared significant if any of the k P-values were less than the critical <lb/>value. Critical values for these simulations were Bonferroni-adjusted as α* = α/k. <lb/>For each combination of the parameters k, d, and π0, we generated 100 replicate samples <lb/>of m1 effect SNPs. To generate Type I error and FDR estimates, we drew a random sample of m-<lb/>m1 P-values for each replicate set of effect SNPs from a pool of ~10 6 P-values computed from <lb/>null SNPs in preliminary simulations. This simplifying procedure is based on the well-known <lb/>expectation that P-values from null SNPs follow a uniform distribution (e.g., Hung et al., 1997), <lb/>and it allowed us to increase replication of the simulation study while minimizing computer run <lb/>times. We validated our results by running two fully sampled replicates where m = 10,000 SNPs <lb/>were simulated at both power scenarios using all k and d combinations shown here. <lb/>Simulations of SNP and phenotypic data were carried out in Matlab r2010b [24]. <lb/>Simulated data were analyzed using SAS/STAT PROC GLM software, Version 9.2 of the SAS <lb/>System for Windows and Unix. A software package to carry out these simulations has been made <lb/>publicly available at http://bio.fsu.edu [Note to editor: URL is temporary; software will be made <lb/>available upon publication]. Code is available upon request from the corresponding author. <lb/>Results <lb/>Independent SNPs <lb/>The simulations are constructed so that we know which predictor SNPs are assigned effects, <lb/>which we term &quot;effect SNPs,&quot; and the &quot;null SNPs&quot; that do not have effects. Once our simulated <lb/>data have been subjected to statistical testing, the m SNPs are categorized into four groups as <lb/>shown in Table 1. This allows us to understand the relationship between the parameters of the <lb/>simulations and tests and the following measures: Power, or true positive rate <lb/>(TPR=TP/[TP+FN]), is the proportion of effect SNPs that are declared significant. False positive <lb/>rate (FPR=FP/[FP+TN]) is the proportion of null SNPs that are declared to be significant. False <lb/>discovery rate (FDR=FP/[TP+FP]) is the proportion of SNPs judged significant that are null. If <lb/>the assumptions of the statistical test are met, Type I error is equal to the critical P-value, α. Type <lb/>II error, β, is determined by properties of the data and the choice of α. Type I and Type II error <lb/>rates determine power, FPR and FDR. <lb/>The independent SNP simulations are constructed to match the assumptions of our <lb/>statistical tests. We tested for departures from the expected uniform distribution of P-values <lb/>computed from null SNPs, and verified that the FPR matched expected Type I error rates in the <lb/>absence of true effects. In all cases, results conformed to the null expectation. <lb/>Power and FDR <lb/>The first set of simulations is directed at understanding the relationship between power, the <lb/>number of dimensions that have genetic effects (d), and the number of orthogonal measurements <lb/>analyzed (k). In each replicate, we sampled m=10,000 independent SNPs, and assigned <lb/>phenotypic effects to m1 = m(1-π0) of these as described in the Methods. The m1 SNPs were <lb/>assigned effects sufficient to explain 90% of the genetic variation observed in our experiments <lb/>(i.e., u = 0.1). We simulated data for nine different values of d; each of these sets was then <lb/>analyzed at the same nine values of k. Each (d, k) combination was replicated 100 times. We <lb/>show results for a high-power case where 100 of the SNPs cause the genetic variance in <lb/>phenotype (π0=0.99), and a low-power case where 3,000 of the SNPs cause the genetic variance <lb/>in phenotype (π0=0.70). <lb/>Figures 1 and 2 show power and FDR for a variety of α values for the high and low <lb/>power simulations. Power is, as expected, strongly influenced by 1-π0, the proportion of SNPs <lb/>with phenotypic effects. Power is much higher overall when the genetic variance can be <lb/>explained by a smaller number of SNPs of large effect. Similarly, power can be increased by <lb/>relaxing α, although this has the expected [25] and detrimental effect of making the probability <lb/>that a SNP is judged significant essentially random, so that FDR approaches π0. The underlying <lb/>exponential distribution of effect sizes simulated is a challenging one for GWAS, as the mode of <lb/>effect size will be close to 0. When k and d are both high, power can be impressively high, given <lb/>this distribution of effect sizes. <lb/>The key results relevant to whether a multivariate approach to GWAS is beneficial are in <lb/>the pattern of power and FDR at different dimensionalities (d) and numbers of traits (k). Despite <lb/>the obvious wide differences that varying power and α have, the pattern of effects of d and k are <lb/>similar across the range of parameter values. These patterns are shown most clearly in Figure 3, <lb/>which gives a more detailed look at power and FDR for the high-power case at α = 10 -4 . First, <lb/>note that when k is low, power is always low and FDR is always high. This is most evident in <lb/>the univariate case, utilized in almost all previous association studies. When d is low, <lb/>performance is also poor, regardless of k. Second, power increases and FDR decreases with k <lb/>when k&lt;d. Power is maximized and FDR minimized when the true and tested dimensionalities <lb/>match, that is when k=d. Third, power decreases and FDR increases modestly when k&gt;d, <lb/>showing a diminishing rate of change as k increases. At k&lt;d, increasing k places the true effects <lb/>against a smaller background of error variance in the direction of the effect. When k&gt;d, <lb/>increasing k increases the error variance, while leaving the signal of the true effects unchanged. <lb/>Clearly, when the underlying genetics is multivariate, a multivariate analysis is superior to a <lb/>univariate analysis. <lb/>The asymmetry around k=d is likely due to our choice of variance-ordered principal <lb/>components scores as traits, so that trait i is always more variable than trait i+1. In other words, <lb/>we always choose the most informative k traits to measure. Thus patterns shown in Figs. 1-3 <lb/>should hold when trait sampling is based on preliminary data that identify those aspects of the <lb/>phenotype that are most informative, rather than a random subset of possible traits. If we had not <lb/>chosen to treat principal component eigenvectors as traits, the variance explained by adding one <lb/>more trait would have a far greater random component, although the expected gain (or loss) will <lb/>be the same. In some cases the k+1th random trait would explain more conditionally <lb/>independent variation than the average of the first k random traits, but in other cases, it will <lb/>explain less. Our results reflect the average gain over adding all possible k+1th traits that define a <lb/>particular phenotype space. <lb/>When confronted with a multivariate data set with k variables, a common response is to <lb/>perform k univariate analyses. In Figure 4 we compare the SNP-wise power and FDR from such <lb/>multiple univariate analyses to the corresponding k-variate multivariate analyses using the d=59, <lb/>high-power simulations whose results are shown in Figures 1 and 3. To perform the multiple <lb/>univariate analysis, we calculated the probability that a SNP was declared significant in any of <lb/>the k univariate tests after applying a Bonferroni correction to α. The power of the multiple <lb/>univariate analysis relative to the corresponding multivariate analysis decreases as k increases. <lb/>Similarly the relative FDR increases. On the other hand, the k univariate analyses are far more <lb/>effective than a single univariate analysis at detecting SNP effects. For example, examination of <lb/>Fig. 3A shows that at α = 10 -4 a 59-dimensional multivariate analysis is about 10 times more <lb/>powerful than a single univariate analysis, whereas Fig. 4A (circles) shows that the same analysis <lb/>is only 2.2 times as powerful as 59 univariate analyses. Similarly, the lower P-value used in the <lb/>multiple-univariate analyses is effective at controlling the FDR rate relative to single univariate <lb/>tests. <lb/>Additional simulations show that the uniformly low power for univariate analyses in our <lb/>simulations can be partially rescued by increasing the number of lines included in the study. For <lb/>example, for the high-power scenario described here (π0 = 0.99), using α = 10 -4 , a five-fold <lb/>increase in sample size from N = 164 to 820 results in a five-fold increase in average power from <lb/>2.3% to 10.5% for the univariate case (k = 1) when d = 59, whereas for the corresponding k = d = <lb/> 59 case, average power increases from 41.8% to 69.8%. Power also increases modestly when <lb/>
            SNP effect sizes are more homogeneously distributed than they are under the exponential <lb/>distribution, or when the number of causal SNPs is even smaller (results not shown). <lb/>Simulations of correlated SNPs <lb/>The above simulations were constructed to ensure that the SNP genotypes are independent, that <lb/>is that there is no LD. This is clearly unrealistic, as any genome-wide association study will <lb/>include closely linked SNPs that may be in LD, as well as distant sites that happen to be <lb/>correlated in the finite sample of genotypes scored. Consequently, we conducted an additional <lb/>set of simulations focused on the effects of LD on power and FDR. As described in Methods, we <lb/>used a real data set, the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel [19], to provide an example of LD <lb/>in a real population to structure our simulations. From these data, we identified all SNPs <lb/>correlated with a focal SNP, which we call a SNP family. We simulated effects for focal SNPs in <lb/>1,000 SNP families, 100 families drawn from each MAF decile that had at least one correlated <lb/>SNP. The mean and median number of SNPs/family was 169 and 14, respectively. <lb/>Interpretation of results in the presence of LD is more complex than the ideal case, and <lb/>depends on the purpose of the analysis. If the goal is to confirm that some genetic variation <lb/>affects the phenotype, then any significant SNPs in a family with a true positive SNP is helpful. <lb/>We refer to such correlated SNPs as family-positives. We would ideally like to identify <lb/>individual SNPs that cause phenotypic variation (QTNs), so that, for example, the nature of <lb/>regions with effects can be studied. In this case, we seek the true-positive causal SNP. <lb/>Figure 5 shows the relevant results for the case of d=59, k=59. Regardless of the P-value <lb/>cutoff, the number of family-positive SNPs per true positive SNP (upward pointing triangles) <lb/>remains on average above 1. Note that even when the focal SNP with the simulated effect is not <lb/>significant (downward pointing triangles in Fig. 4), there are frequently (but not always) <lb/>correlated family-positive SNPs. This suggests that in the presence of even the modest <lb/>disequilibrium present in the DGRP, the SNP-wise false discovery rate will be high. Note that <lb/>the SNP-wise false positive rate in the absence of a simulated effect was always higher than the <lb/>nominal value due to the large number of SNPs in the average family. For the effect size <lb/>simulated, power remains good over the entire range of P-values. <lb/>We investigated how the family-positive rate changes with the magnitude of LD. Figure <lb/>6a shows the probability that a null SNP is significant when the focal SNP is correctly judged <lb/>significant, as a function of gametic correlation (r) with the focal SNP. The family-positive rate <lb/>per SNP declines rapidly as r decreases. On the other hand, Fig. 6b shows that this decrease in <lb/>probability of a family-positive per SNP is countered by the much larger number of SNPs with <lb/>weaker correlations (Fig. 6c). When less conservative values for α are used, the number of <lb/>family-positives correlated with each focal SNP continues to rise as lower r bins are considered. <lb/>Even when conservative P-values are adopted, the advantage suggested in Fig. 6a is much <lb/>reduced. Note that sites perfectly correlated with the focal SNP can still yield different test <lb/>statistics than the focal SNP due to missing genotypic assignments. <lb/>The above approaches for maximizing the true positive rate are based solely on <lb/>significance testing. As an alternative, we explored using the rank of P-values within a SNP LD <lb/>family to maximize true positives. For full-rank analyses, the focal (i.e., effect) SNP had the <lb/>lowest P-value in 77% of the families; in 86% the focal SNP had one of the two lowest P-values. <lb/>Figure 7a shows the proportion of all families for which the focal SNP in fact has the best P-<lb/>value among all members of its family as a function of k. The probability that this fortunate <lb/>situation occurs increases markedly with k to nearly 80% at the full dimensionality simulated. <lb/>The situation is even more favorable if just the families with significant SNPs are included in the <lb/>analysis. <lb/>Analysis of the DGRP data shows that a much larger number of SNPs are highly <lb/>correlated with rare minor alleles compared with common minor alleles. We therefore expected <lb/>that the sites with low allele frequencies would be much less likely to have the focal effect SNP <lb/>with the lowest P-value. Figure 7b shows that this is indeed the case. For these parameter <lb/>values, causal SNPs are very likely to be correctly identified with high-dimensional analyses in <lb/>families with allele frequencies over 0.07. <lb/>More generally, the results in Fig. 7 are driven by greater dissimilarity between the <lb/>distributions of P-values for correlated effect and null SNPs at increasing k (Fig. 7c). Both <lb/>distributions become increasingly biased toward lower P-values as k approaches d, but P-values <lb/>of effect SNPs are improved more than those of null SNPs. This discrepancy is likely a general <lb/>outcome of increasing statistical power. <lb/>These results indicate that when power, effect size and minor allele frequency are large <lb/>enough, it can be effective to test all SNPs for statistical significance, and then compare those <lb/>results within LD families. For cases where there is likely to be lower power than we have <lb/>simulated, the probability that the most extreme P-value correspond to effect SNPs will certainly <lb/>be lower than in our simulations. However, retention of a sample of the SNPs with the best P-<lb/>values within their families would remain an effective strategy for winnowing sites to validate. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>
            Our simulation results have shown several advantages of multivariate analyses for association <lb/>studies that are likely to be general. Power generally rises and false discovery rate falls with the <lb/>number of phenotypes that are measured. In addition, the ability to discriminate between true <lb/>positives and positives caused by linkage disequilibrium with a causal SNP also increases with <lb/>the number of traits measured. We also show that association analyses that explicitly take into <lb/>account the SNPs that are highly correlated with significant SNPs will be superior to those that <lb/>do not. <lb/>Despite the fact that we based our simulations on the allele frequency and linkage <lb/>disequilibrium (LD) distributions in a specific data set, the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel <lb/>(Mackay et al. 2012), our results address general features of multivariate analyses. The <lb/>distribution of allele frequencies in the DGRP is a typical U-shaped distribution. Mackay et al. <lb/>(2012) showed that the influence of LD in the DGRP was less than in other metazoan <lb/>populations, but substantial LD is found even in this population, as our unpublished analyses <lb/>show. By focusing our LD simulations on SNPs that are in LD with other SNPs, we capture the <lb/>effects of LD with respect to a focal SNP, which will be similar in any population. <lb/>Our first major result is that power in GWAS increases dramatically with the number of <lb/>measured traits (k), up until the number of traits measured captures the true dimensionality of the <lb/>phenotype, k=d. Similarly, false discovery rate falls under the same assumptions. These <lb/>qualitative results hold over a wide range of power, and choice of significance thresholds, as <lb/>shown in Figs. 1-3. The gains can be very dramatic: for example, in the case of maximum true <lb/>dimensionality in Fig. 3, power increases by more than 10-fold when the number of traits <lb/>increases from one to the maximum number of traits, while the false discovery rate falls by 3-<lb/>fold. The likely cause of this is that the directions of simulated effects are most distinct in the <lb/>space that they actually reside in. Effects that are in very different directions in a high-<lb/>dimensional space will often have very similar effects in a low-dimensional subspace. On the <lb/>other hand, increasing the number of measured traits k above true dimensionality d, simply adds <lb/>error due to non-genetic effects without adding new information. Consequently, when the <lb/>number of measured traits exceeds true dimensionality, power falls and the false discovery rate <lb/>increases. However, the rate of gain for measuring an additional trait is greater below the correct <lb/>dimensionality than the rate of loss above the correct dimensionality. For example, for the <lb/>parameters in Fig. 3, if the true dimensionality is 20, increasing the measured traits from 1 to 20 <lb/>increases power by a factor of 8, while measuring an extra 39 traits, to k=59, decreases power by <lb/>only one-fourth. <lb/>Another aspect of our results that requires some comment is the correlation between <lb/>power and true dimensionality (d) when the number of traits analyzed (k) is also allowed to <lb/>increase. This is equivalent to moving up the diagonal of Figures 1 and 2. Our simulation <lb/>algorithm holds the total amount of genetic variation across all d dimensions constant, so that in <lb/>the d=1 case all genetic variation is concentrated along just one vector. The gain in power with d <lb/>is best explained by the spreading of effect vectors into higher dimensional spaces, so that their <lb/>directions become increasingly distinct. At d=1, all the genetic variation that is not explained by <lb/>the focal SNP is part of the error variation against which that effect must be detected. In higher <lb/>dimensions, only SNPs whose effects are in similar directions to that of the focal SNP contribute <lb/>to the background unexplained variation. For a particular experimental population, d is not <lb/>under the control of the experimenter, who can only choose k. <lb/>Although our results may be new to some within the community doing GWAS, they are <lb/>largely expected based on straightforward geometric and statistical arguments. Multivariate <lb/>methods take advantage of the entire space of possible effects for testing. If we measure k traits, <lb/>we could do k univariate tests, which will be successful at detecting effects that are large in the <lb/>direction of each measured trait. However, if a genetic effect of the same relative magnitude is <lb/>spread over a large proportion of the measured traits, it may be undetectable to univariate <lb/>analyses, but a multivariate analysis will be just as likely to detect it as if the entire effect were <lb/>on a single trait. When we do not measure all the trait effects that a SNP produces we are <lb/>measuring projections of true genetic effects, and these can be very misleading. <lb/>It is important to realize that we have examined the average power over all the SNPs that <lb/>explain our simulated genetic effects. O&apos;Reilly et al. (2012) performed a complementary set of <lb/>simulations to ours, in which they considered the power to detect individual SNP effects against <lb/>varying backgrounds of more or less correlated residual variation. As in our simulations, they <lb/>found that the power of a multivariate approach was generally much greater than univariate <lb/>analyses, but that there were particular orientations of SNP effects relative to the residual <lb/>variation where univariate analyses performed slightly better than a multivariate one. Such cases <lb/>undoubtedly occur in our simulations for individual SNPs whose orientations are, for example, <lb/>exactly in the same direction as a measured trait (or an eigenvector). However, we sampled SNP <lb/>effects randomly from throughout the multivariate space simulated, and our results reflect the <lb/>average power to detect the entire set of SNPs, not individual cases. <lb/>We have also shown that increasing the number of dimensions analyzed can greatly aid in <lb/>distinguishing true positives and SNPs that are significant because of linkage (gametic-phase) <lb/>disequilibrium (LD, Fig. 7) with a causal SNP. Presumably the mechanism that produces this <lb/>effect is similar to those that increase power and reduce FDR in the absence of LD-more <lb/>information is added with every trait measured. SNPs with no real effects may happen to <lb/>diverge from the null in any one dimension, but are increasingly unlikely to do so when averaged <lb/>over all dimensions. <lb/>The asymmetry in the disadvantages of measuring too many vs. too few traits depends on <lb/>some important but biologically and operationally justifiable assumptions about the nature of the <lb/>traits measured. We have defined traits based on a principal components rotation of the genetic <lb/>variance-covariance matrix. This defines our trait 1 as the combination of the measured <lb/>phenotypes with the most genetic variation, trait 2 as the combination with the second most <lb/>variation, etc. This mimics experiments in which the full set of traits is measured before <lb/>analysis, so that intelligent decisions can be made about which combinations of traits are most <lb/>informative. This is a common approach to the analysis of multivariate data sets [e.g., 3], that <lb/>ensures both that no two variables explain the same variance (i.e., variables are conditionally <lb/>independent), and that variables, when considered jointly, account for the entire variance in the <lb/>data. The use of a principal components definition of traits explains the asymmetry noted above. <lb/>In making the transition from measuring k traits vs. k+1 informative traits, we have always <lb/>chosen to add the most informative trait. Similarly, when going beyond the true dimensionality, <lb/>the d+1th contributes less variation than the dth trait, so less misleading error variance is <lb/>contributed with each extra trait. <lb/>This situation may be rather different when considering whether to measure and analyze <lb/>an additional trait whose variational properties are not known. Here, one can imagine different <lb/>outcomes. For morphological traits, the majority of variation is frequently in overall size, so <lb/>measuring any one part of the body is likely to capture a great deal of size variation. In this case <lb/>the first trait measured is likely to capture more variation than the second, just as with the <lb/>principal components approach. On the other hand, if mixtures of different types of traits are <lb/>studied, for example life history, physiological and behavioral traits, it is very possible that the <lb/>first trait measured will be less informative than a subsequent trait. Given these considerations, <lb/>we recommend that wherever possible a preliminary assessment of the true genetic <lb/>dimensionality of the suite of traits under study be undertaken prior to an association study. <lb/>Several approaches have been utilized to estimate trait dimensionality [26-30], but their <lb/>implementation in genomic analysis must become widespread if we are to assess the true <lb/>statistical power of GWAS. Ultimately, the decision whether to include an additional trait in an <lb/>analysis depends on the amount of new genetic variation brought by the trait, which can be <lb/>estimated as its heritability after partialling out the effect of all other measured traits. PCA and <lb/>other eigendecomposition methods are computationally inexpensive procedures to generate sets <lb/>of conditionally independent traits. Multiple regression of new on previously measured traits can <lb/>help determine whether additional phenotypes significantly expand the dimensionality of a data <lb/>set. <lb/>A major challenge to all real genome-wide association studies is the presence of linkage <lb/>disequilibrium, LD. When the genotypes at different SNPs are correlated, a significant <lb/>association at one will predict that a significant association will be found for the other. When we <lb/>simulated such cases, we found that, as expected, SNPs with real effects tended to have lower P-<lb/>values than those without effects. The key result however, is that the tendency of P-values to <lb/>distinguish true from LD-correlated effects was greatly enhanced by increasing the <lb/>dimensionality of the analysis. This may be a general side-effect of the increasing statistical <lb/>power [31,32], which suggests an avenue to seek high-power conditions that ensure robustness <lb/>of GWAS to the violations of the assumption of independence among tested SNPs. <lb/>We caution that the actual power and false discovery rates we find in our simulations are <lb/>dependent on a large number of assumptions built into our simulations. Heritability of the traits <lb/>considered here (Fig. S4), which determines the upper boundaries of wing shape dimensionality, <lb/>determines the precise extent whereby matching sampling (k) and true (d) dimension translates <lb/>into a power increase. Highly integrated phenotypes where a few dimensions explain most of the <lb/>genetic variance will see a diminished advantage in adding new traits relative to our study, <lb/>whereas complex phenotypes comprising traits from multiple systems could see even stronger <lb/>gains in power at higher dimensions. No general conclusions can be drawn from the numerical <lb/>values in our results. What we believe can be generalized from our results are these overall <lb/>trends: given the high dimensionality of most, if not all, phenotypes, measuring and analyzing <lb/>more traits is better than measuring fewer. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Despite the statistical advantages to multivariate analyses that we have demonstrated, the <lb/>decision to embark on such a study depends on the nature of the question under study, and the <lb/>costs of doing so. In many cases, the principal drawback of doing a multivariate association <lb/>study is the cost involved in measuring more traits, which is compounded by the costs of dealing <lb/>with additional factors such as population structure [e.g., 33] and cross-tissue variance [34,35] in <lb/>a multivariate context. Multivariate studies will be greatly facilitated by the development of <lb/>high-throughput phenomic techniques [16,36]. <lb/>Traditional power analysis focuses on magnitudes of effects and sample sizes, but our <lb/>results strongly suggest that the number of traits analyzed in relation to the true dimensionality <lb/>also greatly affects the expected power of a GWAS. We recommend that explicit analyses of <lb/>phenotypic dimensionality be undertaken as part of the designing a GWAS, so that an informed <lb/>balance between the number of traits and the number of genotypes to assess can be achieved. <lb/>This is likely to be especially critical in genomic studies like eQTL analyses of transcript <lb/>abundances [37,38], where the cost of generating and sequencing additional genotypes far <lb/>exceeds those of acquiring nearly complete phenotypic information. <lb/>It is clear that the true dimensionality of complex phenotypes is generally larger than one <lb/>[16]. Consequently, we recommend that multivariate approaches be adopted much more widely. <lb/>This will result in gains in power and decreases in false discovery rates, particularly in the <lb/>presence of linkage disequilibrium. We can also anticipate that when the directions of effects are <lb/>included in the interpretation of SNP effects, multivariate approaches will increase the <lb/>interpretability of the mechanisms of genetic effects, and the complexity of the pathways by <lb/>which they do so. All these factors suggest that identification of causal variation will become <lb/>easier as truly phenomic approaches to GWAS become more widespread. <lb/></body>
