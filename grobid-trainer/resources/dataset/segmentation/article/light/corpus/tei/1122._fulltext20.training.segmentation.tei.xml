			<body>Introduction <lb/>The binary compound of selenium(II) with bromine, SeBr 2 , <lb/>has not been isolated but gives a series of anionic complexes <lb/>with bromide ions. The known modifications of such com-<lb/>plexes are the nearly square-planar mononuclear [SeBr 4 ] 2Ϫ <lb/>ion [1, 2], the dinuclear [Se 2 Br 6 ] 2Ϫ ion formed by two edge-<lb/>sharing distorted SeBr 4 squares [1, 3], the trinuclear <lb/>[Se 3 Br 8 ] 2Ϫ ion consisting of three edge-sharing square-<lb/>planar SeBr 4 units [4], the tetranuclear ion [Se 4 Br 14 ] 2Ϫ <lb/>which is built of two parallel planar Se 2 Br 6 units connected <lb/>via two linear Br-bridges [4, 5], and the pentanuclear ion <lb/>[Se 5 Br 12 ] 2Ϫ , consisting of a central square-planar SeBr 4 unit <lb/>with two trans-edges being shared with additional pairs of <lb/>square-planar SeBr 4 units [4]. <lb/>The dinuclear hexabromo-diselenate(II) anion was iso-<lb/>lated for first time as thetetraphenylphosphonium salt, <lb/>[PPh 4 ] 2 [Se 2 Br 6 ], from the reaction of selenium tetrabromide, <lb/>SeBr 4 (which is in equilibrium with SeBr 2 , Se 2 Br 2 and Br 2 <lb/>in solution), and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide, <lb/>[PPh 4 ]Br, [1]. The following sequence of reactions was pro-<lb/>posed for the formation of hexabromo-diselenate ions <lb/>SeBr 4 o SeBr 2 ϩ Br 2 , <lb/>2SeBr 2 ϩ 2Br 2 ϩ 4[PPh 4 ]Br o [PPh 4 ] 2 [Se 2 Br 6 ] ϩ 2[PPh 4 ]Br 3 . <lb/></body>

			<body>Selenium reacts with bromine (1:1) in acetonitrile <lb/>solution: <lb/>2Se ϩ Br 2 o Se 2 Br 2 . <lb/>However when the Se/Br 2 ratio is 2.0, the formation of <lb/>Se 2 Br 2 is not quantitative [6, 7], since both Se 2 Br 2 and Br 2 <lb/>participate in the disproportionation equilibria [6Ϫ8]: <lb/>2SeBr 2 o Se 2 Br 2 ϩ Br 2 <lb/>and <lb/>3SeBr 2 o Se 2 Br 2 ϩ SeBr 4 . <lb/>Therefore, the selenium bromides SeBr 4 [8], Se 3 Br 2 and <lb/>Se 4 Br 2 , may be present in minor amounts in the reaction <lb/>mixture as well [6]. <lb/>It had been shown earlier [2, 3, 6, 9, 13Ϫ11] that the <lb/>formation of species which will crystallize from the solution <lb/>when selenium reacts with bromine in the presence of bro-<lb/>mide ions, depends on equilibrium concentrations and solu-<lb/>bilities, respectively, and Ϫ especially Ϫ on the nature of <lb/>the cation, the bromide of which was used for the synthesis. <lb/>For example, the reaction of selenium with bromine <lb/>in the presence of phenyltrimethylammonium bromide, <lb/>[NMe 3 Ph]Br, was adapted [6] to the stoichiometry <lb/>5Se ϩ 4Br 2 ϩ 2Br Ϫ Ǟ [SeBr 6 (Se 2 Br 2 ) 2 ] 2Ϫ <lb/>and the first mixed-valence bromoselenate(IV/I), i.e. phenyl-<lb/>trimethylammonium hexabromoselenate(IV)-bis{dibromo-<lb/></body>

(The hydro-<lb/>gen atoms of the ethyl and phenyl groups are omitted for the sake <lb/>of clarity.) <lb/>more reduced, the two terminal bonds differing by 0.026 Å <lb/>and the two bridging bonds by 0.099 Å . The reason for this <lb/>asxmmetry,which occursin several dihalogeno-bridged chal-<lb/>cogen(II) and chalcogen(IV) compounds [1, 7, 16], is not <lb/>clear. In the case of [PPh 4 ] 2 [Se 2 Br 6 ] (1) where the asymmetr <lb/>is relatively large, it was pointed out, that it may be initiated <lb/>by interionic halogen-halogen contacts. But in 2, with even <lb/>smaller asymmetry than in [NMe 3 Ph] 2 [Se 2 Br 6 ], all terminal <lb/>Br atoms (Br1 and Br2) have short interionic contacts, <lb/>3.606 Å . In the centrosymmetric anion of [PPh 4 ] 2 [Se 2 Br 6 ] <lb/>(1) the bondsof the four-membered ring are alternatively <lb/>long and short; the same is observed in the centrosymmetric <lb/>anion of 2, whereas in the asymmetric anion of <lb/>[NMe 3 Ph] 2 [Se 2 Br 6 ] the longest bond is situated opposite to <lb/>the shortest one. <lb/>The selenium atoms of the [Se 2 Br 6 ] 2Ϫ anion of 2 are act-<lb/>ing as central atoms in the asymmetric, nearly linear sys-<lb/>tems Br1ϪSeϪBr3a and Br2ϪSeϪBr3. The angles at the <lb/>selenium atom are 175.12(4) and 174.45(4)°, respectively. <lb/>The Br terminal ϪSe II ϪBr terminal bond angle (94.72(4)°) is <lb/>larger than 90°, presumably due to an intramolecular <lb/>ligandϪligand interaction between the terminal Br atoms. <lb/>The bonds in the nearly linear Br t ϪSeϪμBr systems are <lb/>of the three-centre, four-electron (3cϪ4e) type with only <lb/>one occupied bonding orbital. All SeϪμBr bridging bonds <lb/>are considerably longer than the terminal SeϪBr bonds. <lb/>The average value of the total lengths of the linear <lb/>BrϪSeϪBr system in the [Se 2 Br 6 ] 2Ϫ ion of 2 is 5.2835 Å <lb/>which is close to the corresponding values in the [Se 2 Br 6 ] 2Ϫ <lb/>ion of [PPh 4 ] 2 [Se 2 Br 6 ] (1), 5.241 Å [1], and of <lb/>[NMe 3 Ph] 2 [Se 2 Br 6 ], 5.270 Å [3]. <lb/>In the directions of the SeϪBr1, SeϪBr2, SeaϪBr1a, <lb/>Se1aϪBr2a bonds of adjacent [Se 2 Br 6 ] 2Ϫ anions, the Br1 <lb/>atoms have weak bonds to Br2 atoms and vice versa. These <lb/>intermolecular Br1•••Br2 distances are 3.6062(12) Å . As a <lb/>result, the net-like association of the anions in the crystals <lb/>of 2 is formed (Fig. 2). <lb/></body>
