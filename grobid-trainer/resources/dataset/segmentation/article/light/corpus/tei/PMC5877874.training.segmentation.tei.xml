The phytochemical study of the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from its <lb/>leaves led to the isolation of its most abundant secondary metabolites, belonging to different <lb/>chemical classes. In particular, three phloroglucinols derivatives were identified, confirming <lb/>their significance as chemotaxonomic markers of the Hypericum genus. Among them, the <lb/>3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol was reported here for the first <lb/>time. All six isolated compounds have been evaluated firstly for the inhibition of both Human <lb/>Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA Poly-<lb/>merase (RDDP) and Ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities, for the inhibition of HIV-1 inte-<lb/>grase (IN) in biochemical assays, and also for their effect on viral replication. Among the <lb/>isolated metabolites, three phloroglucinol derivatives and quercitrin were effective on both <lb/>RT-associated RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical assays. The same active com-<lb/>pounds affected also HIV-1 IN strand transfer function, suggesting the involvement of the <lb/>RNase H active site. Furthermore, phloroglucinols compounds, included the newly identified <lb/>compound, were able to inhibit the HIV-1 replication in cell based assays. <lb/></front>

			<body>in healthcare [1]. Indeed, plant products represent, according to an assessment of FDA on the <lb/>source of natural products, over one-quarter of all approved new molecular entities [2,3]. How-<lb/>ever, despite the intensive investigation of plant kingdom, it is estimated that only 6% of the <lb/>approximately 300,000 species of higher plants have been pharmacologically investigated, and <lb/>only 15% phytochemically [4]. Therefore, plants should be further investigated because new <lb/>compounds with original structures and novel modes of action are continuously required. Nat-<lb/>urally occurring compounds frequently inspire synthetic medicinal compounds, and they could <lb/>be chemically modified, based upon their structural and biological properties [5-8]. Their struc-<lb/>tural modification allows increasing their efficacy and selectivity, improving physicochemical, <lb/>biochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, removing or reducing side effects. <lb/>The therapeutic area of infectious diseases has benefited from abundant scaffold diversity <lb/>in natural products, able to interact with many specific targets [7]. Significant research and <lb/>development over the last 25 years into antiviral drug discovery has resulted in the identifica-<lb/>tion of important antiviral drugs [7]. In particular, a number of attempts have been made in <lb/>the fight against HIV-1 infection and several natural compounds able to inhibit the viral <lb/>enzymes have been reported [9-17]. However, so far all anti HIV-1 approved drugs were <lb/>obtained only by chemical synthesis. <lb/>HIV-1, the etiological agent of AIDS, still remains a global scourge despite the availability <lb/>of more than 30 approved anti-AIDS drugs [18]. Although the global scale-up of antiretroviral <lb/>therapy has contributed to reduce the number of new infections and AIDS-related deaths, <lb/>about 37 million people were estimated to be infected with HIV in 2016, with 1.8 million of <lb/>new infections and 1 million of deaths [19]. To date there is no vaccine or cure for HIV infec-<lb/>tion, and the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy, which combines two or three antiviral agents, <lb/>targeting different steps of the virus replication cycle, can be compromised by the selection of <lb/>strains resistant to one or multiple drug classes [20,21] and treatment-associated toxicity [22], <lb/>requiring the discovery of new antiviral agents with innovative modes of action or targets. In <lb/>this respect, the identification of one molecule able to inhibit more than one viral function <lb/>would provide significant advantages, raising the genetic barrier to resistance and increasing <lb/>the compliance to therapy. <lb/>Five different classes of anti-AIDS approved molecules are available for therapy [18] and the <lb/>majority of them is represented by inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (RT), the enzyme respon-<lb/>sible for the conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome into a double-stranded cDNA <lb/>[23,24]. RT is a multifunctional enzyme with two associated functions [25], DNA polymerase <lb/>and RNase H activities [26,27], that have been proven to be both essential for viral replication. <lb/>While the first one is currently the main target for AIDS treatment, the latter is the only HIV <lb/>enzymatic function not targeted by approved antiviral drugs [26,28,29], although it is a very <lb/>promising target [30]. Indeed it has been shown that RNase H inactivation lead to non-infec-<lb/>tious virions [31] and its selective inhibition completely blocks viral replication [32,33]. RNase <lb/>H catalytic core is highly conserved among viral species and strains [34,35] and presents high <lb/>structural homologies with HIV-1 integrase (IN) [24], the enzyme responsible for the integra-<lb/>tion of the HIV-1 cDNA genome into the host cell chromosome, that takes place through <lb/>DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions [36]. Among the cellular factors involved in the <lb/>integration process into the host DNA there is the human lens epitelium-derived growth factor <lb/>LEDGF/p75 [37], a nuclear protein that promotes IN chromatin tethering by establishing spe-<lb/>cific interactions between its IN-binding domain and the IN dimer. IN has become an explored <lb/>target for development of anti HIV treatments [24,38-40], with raltegravir [41,42], elvitegravir <lb/>[43] and dolutegravir [44] that are IN inhibitors approved for clinical use. <lb/>For many years, the drug discovery was based on searching for new compounds or new tar-<lb/>gets, recently the development of single molecules targeting both viral HIV-1 RT-associated <lb/></body>

			<body>RNase H and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) functions, or RNase H and IN func-<lb/>tions (dual inhibitors) has been proposed as an interesting approach [17,26,45-49]. This inno-<lb/>vative strategy could offer the possibility to reduce the toxicity associated to the co-<lb/>administration of several classes of drugs [18,40]. <lb/>In our ongoing research of new natural compounds as potential scaffolds for developing <lb/>innovative inhibitors of the HIV-1, we focused on Sardinian endemic flora, in which geo-<lb/>graphical isolation has selected original metabolic profiles, as documented by several reports <lb/>[14,50-60]. <lb/>In particular, in this study we focus on Hypericum scruglii Bacchetta, Brullo et Salmeri <lb/>[61,62], a species exclusive to Sardinia island (Italy). Despite the large number of Hypericum <lb/>species, only H. perforatum L. has been intensively investigated, both chemically and pharma-<lb/>cologically. Commonly known as St. John&apos;s wort, it is widely used in Europe as a drug for the <lb/>treatment of mild to moderate depression [63,64]. When compared to H. perforatum, few <lb/>studies have been undertaken on the other members of this genus although their recognized <lb/>pharmacological properties range from wound healing and antiseptics to antiviral, anti-<lb/>inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidants, antifungal, antimicrobial, cardioprotective and cyto-<lb/>toxic activities[14,51-53,65-69]. Some Hypericum species also exhibited anti HIV-1 properties <lb/>[14,70,71]. This genus is known for the production of a broad spectrum of secondary metabo-<lb/>lites, mainly naphthodianthrones (hypericin and pseudohypericin), phloroglucinols (hyper-<lb/>forin and adhyperforin), phenolic acids, flavonoids (hyperoside, rutin or quercitrin), <lb/>xanthones and essential oils [14,72-75]. Although H. scruglii was not already characterized in <lb/>terms of phytochemical composition and biological/pharmacological properties, recently <lb/>Mandrone et al. [53] have identified from this species shikimic and chlorogenic acids, two <lb/>known phlorogucinols derivatives, quercitrin, hyperoside and hypericin, even though in a very <lb/>low content, confirming their chemotaxonomic significance [76]. They have also described the <lb/>antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities. <lb/>In the present study, we investigated the ability of the main compounds isolated from leaves <lb/>of Hypericum scruglii to inhibit both HIV-1 RDDP and RNase H activities in biochemical <lb/>assays. Active compounds were then assayed for their effects on HIV-1 IN activities and to <lb/>interfere with the HIV-1 life cycle. <lb/>Material and methods <lb/>Plant material <lb/>Aerial parts of H. scruglii were collected at the flowering stage (June 2012) in the site of San-<lb/>t&apos;Antonio (Jerzu, Sardinia, Italy, 39˚45&apos;57.4&quot;N 9˚30&apos;41.8&quot;E). The leaves were randomly har-<lb/>vested from 30 individuals of the same population. No flowers, fruits, seeds and roots were <lb/>collected to avoid damage to the population. The species was botanically identified by C.S. and <lb/>a voucher specimen (CAG 239/c) was deposited at the General Herbarium of the Department <lb/>of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Cagliari. Although H. scruglii is endemic, it <lb/>is not protected by local or international regulations. Furthermore, the location where the <lb/>plant material was harvested is not included in national or local parks or any other natural pro-<lb/>tected areas. Therefore, no specific permission was required for its collection. <lb/>Chemicals and instruments <lb/>Reagents and solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Louis, <lb/>MO, USA). The reagents used for expression, purification and biochemical assays were pur-<lb/>chased from Microbiol (Sardinia, Italy), Sigma-Aldrich (Milano, Italy) and PerkinElmer <lb/>(Milano, Italy). The reference compound raltegravir was purchased from ChemScene <lb/></body>

The isola-<lb/>tion of the metabolites was conducted with the aid of distinct chromatographic techniques. The <lb/>thin-layer chromatographies (TLC) were carried out on plates impregnated silica Merck Kiesel-<lb/>gel 60 F 254 thickness 0.20 mm for analytical purposes and on plates impregnated silica Merck <lb/>Kieselgel 60 F 254 thickness 0.5 o 1.0 mm for preparative purposes. The bands were visualized by <lb/>spraying with the solution H 2 SO 4 -AcOH-H 2 O (1:20:4) and subsequent heating in the stove for 5 <lb/>min at 120˚C. The column chromatographies (CC) were performed using either silica gel Merck <lb/>Kieselgel 60 (70-240 mesh), Amberlite XAD-4 (20-50 mesh; Fluka) and XAD-7 (20-50 mesh; <lb/>Fluka), Sephadex LH-201 (Pharmacia) or Bakerbond C8 and C18 as stationary phase. <lb/>NMR spectra were recorded at 25˚C and 300 MHz for 1 H and 75 MHz for 13 C on a Varian <lb/>NMR spectrometer FT-300. Methanol-d 4 was used as internal lock. <lb/>Correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and double quantum filtered COSY (DQF-COSY) spec-<lb/>tra were recorded with gradient enhanced sequence at spectral widths of 3000 Hz in both f2 <lb/>and f1 domains; the relaxation delays were of 1.0 s. The total correlation spectroscopy <lb/>(TOCSY) experiments were performed in the phase-sensitive mode with a mixing time of 90 <lb/>ms. The spectral width was 3000 Hz. For all the homonuclear experiments, the initial matrix of <lb/>512 × 512 data points was zero-filled to give a final matrix of 1 k × 1 k points. <lb/>Proton-detected heteronuclear correlations were measured. Heteronuclear single-quantum <lb/>coherence (HSQC) experiments (optimized for 1 J (H,C) = 140 Hz) were performed in the phase <lb/>sensitive mode with field gradient; the spectral width was 12000 Hz in f1 ( 13 C) and 3000 Hz in <lb/>f2 ( 1 H) and 1.0 s of relaxation delay; the matrix of 1 k × 1 k data points was zero-filled to give a <lb/>final matrix of 2 k × 2 k points. Heteronuclear 2 bond correlation (H2BC) spectra were <lb/>obtained with T = 30.0 ms, and a relaxation delay of 1.0 s; the third-order low-pass filter was <lb/>set for 130 &lt; 1 J (C,H) &lt; 165 Hz. Heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC) experiment <lb/>(optimized for n J (H,C) = 8 Hz) was performed in the absolute value mode with field gradient; <lb/>typically, 1 H-13 C gHMBC were acquired with spectral width of 18000 Hz in f1 ( 13 C) and 3000 <lb/>Hz in f2 ( 1 H) and 1.0 s of relaxation delay; the matrix of 1 k × 1 k data points was zero-filled to <lb/>give a final matrix of 4 k × 4 k points. Constant time inverse-detection gradient accordion <lb/>rescaled heteronuclear multiple bond correlation spectroscopy (CIGAR-HMBC) spectra (8&gt; <lb/>n <lb/>J (H,C) &gt;5) were acquired with the same spectral width used for HMBC. Heteronuclear single-<lb/>quantum coherence-total correlation spectroscopy (HSQC-TOCSY) experiments were opti-<lb/>mized for n J (H,C) = 8 Hz, with a mixing time of 90 ms. <lb/>LC-MS analysis was carried out on an Alliance 2695 separation module equipped with a <lb/>column heater and a sample chiller. The liquid chromatography system was coupled to a <lb/>Waters 2487 dual wavelength UV detector and to a Quattro Micro™ triple quadrupole mass <lb/>spectrometer (Waters/Micromass, Manchester, UK). <lb/>Recombinant proteins were purified using the chromatography system Biological LP <lb/>(Biorad). Biochemical assays were measured using the multiplate reader Victor 3 (Perkin <lb/>Elmer). <lb/>Extraction and isolation of active compounds <lb/>Plant material (70.0 g) was extracted by sonication with a solution of H 2 O:MeOH (1:1), <lb/>immersed in an ultrasonic bath (Elma1Transonicdigitals) for 40 min.

			<body>medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/mLpenicillin, and 50 μg/mL <lb/>streptomycin. The HIV-1 virus NL(AD8) was titrated as follows: serial 5-fold dilutions of the <lb/>virus were made in quadruplicate wells in 96-well culture plates, in a total volume of 100 μL of <lb/>growth medium, for a total of 8 dilution steps. Freshly trypsinized cells (20,000 cells in 100 μL <lb/>of growth medium containing 75 μg/mL DEAE-dextran) were added to each well, and the <lb/>plates were incubated at 37˚C in a humidified 5% CO 2 -95% air environment. After 48 h of <lb/>incubation, the medium was removed and viral infection was quantified using a β-galactosi-<lb/>dase (CPRG) assay (Roche). Twenty thousand TZM-bl cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates <lb/>in complete DMEM supplemented with 30 μg/mL DEAE-dextran (Sigma-Aldrich). Three <lb/>hundred times the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL of HIV AD8 strain and <lb/>seven serial dilutions (range, 40.000 nM to 625 nM) of each compound were added to the cells, <lb/>as previously described [81,82]. Vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO])-treated cells <lb/>served as a negative control. A CCR5 inhibitor (maraviroc) and an integrase inhibitor (dolute-<lb/>gravir) were used as positive-control drugs. The TZM-bl indicator cell line has an integrated <lb/>copy of the β-galactosidase gene under control of the HIV-1 promoter. Β-Galactosidase <lb/>expression, measured by use of a chlorophenol red/β-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG) assay <lb/>(Roche) in cell lysates 48 h post-infection was used as a marker of HIV infection. The inhibi-<lb/>tory curves were fitted by nonlinear regression, allowing for the calculation of the 50% effective <lb/>concentration (EC 50 ) using the Prism software. To evaluate the cell toxicity of the compounds, <lb/>the metabolic XTT [2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxani-<lb/>lide] test (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. <lb/>Time of addition <lb/>In TOA experiment it is of fundamental importance that only one replication cycle has been <lb/>completed to avoid confounding effects derived from unwashed viruses after 1 hour of infec-<lb/>tion. For this reason, an env-pseudotyped virus (REJO4541 clone 67) was used. Time of addi-<lb/>tion (TOA) experiment was performed as previously described with minor modifications [83]. <lb/>40000 TZM-bl cells/well in a 96-multiwell plate were infected with 1500 X the TCID50 per mL <lb/>of the env-pseudotyped HIV-1 virus in complete medium supplemented with DEAE-dextran <lb/>(Sigma-Aldrich, 30 mg/mL). Virus was incubated with cells for 1 h at 4˚C, and unbound virus <lb/>was subsequently removed by extensive and repeated washing with phosphate-buffered saline <lb/>(PBS) to synchronize the replication. For the next 7 h, antiretroviral compounds inhibiting <lb/>distinct viral replication steps (maraviroc, lamivudine, dolutegravir) and compound 3 were <lb/>added at the following time points: at time 0 and after 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 and 420 min. <lb/>To ensure complete inhibition of viral replication we used a 40-fold EC 50 concentration as <lb/>previously evaluated for each compound on TZM-bl cells [maraviroc (0.7 mM), lamivudine <lb/>(5 mM), dolutegravir (1 mM), and compound 3 (10 mM)]. After 2 days, viral infection was <lb/>quantified using a CPRG assay (Roche) and was then normalized to untreated control cells. <lb/>Results and discussion <lb/>Phytochemical profile <lb/>Based on previous observations [53], a phytochemical study was undertaken in order to isolate <lb/>the most abundant compounds in the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from leaves of H. scru-<lb/>glii (Fig 1). These compounds belong to different classes and, among them, are three phloro-<lb/>glucinol derivatives (compounds 1-3). Three compounds (3-5) were reported and isolated for <lb/>the first time from this species and compound 3 was reported here for the first time. <lb/>The phytoconstituents isolated were 3-geranyl-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol (1), <lb/>3-geranyl-1-(2&apos;-methylpropanoyl)phloroglucinol (2), 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-<lb/></body>

			<body>correlations were in good agreement with the presence of a 2-methylbutanoyl group on the <lb/>aromatic ring. The C-4 carbon of the aromatic ring at δ 108.0 correlates, in the <lb/>CIGAR-HMBC, with the H-7 methylene doublet at δ 3.19. This proton is directly bonded to a <lb/>carbon at δ 23.7, and it shows long range correlations with the aromatic ring and with the C-8 <lb/>and C-9 olefinic carbon at δ 125.5 and 135.1, respectively. Furthermore, the H-8 olefinic pro-<lb/>ton at δ 5.19 correlates with the methyl group linked to the C-9 and the C-10 methylene carbon <lb/>at δ 29.1, bonded to the protons at δ 2.20. <lb/>The H-12 protons at δ 1.62, directly linked to the methylene carbon at δ 23.7, correlates <lb/>with the C-13 and C-14 carbons at δ 77.0 and 149.1, respectively. This latter presents correla-<lb/>tions with the methyl protons at δ 1.75, bonded to the carbon at δ 17.7, and with the olefinic <lb/>protons at δ 4.83 and 4.95 both correlated in the HSQC experiment to the carbon at δ 111.4. <lb/>The correlations observed in the CIGAR-HMBC, H2BC and HSQC-TOCSY spectra sug-<lb/>gested the structure of compound 3 (Fig 3). These data allowed the identification of compound <lb/>3 as 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol. <lb/>Compound 4 was identified as 1,3,5-benzentriol 2-[(2S,3R)-3-(3,4-dihydroxylphenyl)-<lb/>2,3-dihydroxylpropyl], named filiferol, a chalconoid analogue, isolated for the first time from <lb/>leaves of Washingtonia filifera [85]. It is based on a flavonol structure with the reduction of the <lb/>common flavonoid keto group to give an unprecedented methylene carbon on the three car-<lb/>bon chain.

			<body>3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (5 ), is a phenolic acid widely distributed in nature [86]. This <lb/>compound is one of the biologically active components of some medicinal plants, including <lb/>Hypericum perforatum L. [87]. It is been defined by the presence of characteristic signals in the <lb/>1 <lb/>H-NMR spectrum. <lb/>Finally, compound 6, was identified as quercitrin, a quercetin glycoside. It was already <lb/>reported for H. scruglii [53] and it is commonly present in the genus Hypericum [75,76,88-95]. <lb/>Effects of H. scruglii chemical components on both HIV-1 RT-associated <lb/>functions <lb/>Biological activities of H. scruglii were previously investigated reporting its antioxidant and α-<lb/>glucosidase activity [53]. However, up to date, no information on its anti HIV-1 properties <lb/>was available. Given the promising results obtained from Hypericum hircinum L. components <lb/>on both HIV-1 RT associated functions [14], with the objective to identify new metabolites <lb/>able to inhibit both HIV-1 RT-associated functions from the Hypericum genus, the most abun-<lb/>dant compounds (1-6) isolated from H. scruglii have been tested on both RDDP and RNase H <lb/>activities in biochemical assays, using the RDDP selective non-nucleoside RT inhibitor <lb/>(NNRTI) Efavirenz and the RNase H selective diketo acid (DKA) derivative RDS1759 [33] as <lb/>controls (Table 2). In accordance to other reports on naturally occurring phloroglucinol com-<lb/>pounds that have shown a broad range of biological activities including anti-HIV activity <lb/>[71,96-99], our results showed that 3-geranyl-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol (1), 3-ger-<lb/>anyl-1-(2&apos;-methylpropanoyl)phloroglucinol (2), 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl) <lb/>phloroglucinol (3) inhibited both HIV-1 RT-associated activities with IC 50 values around 4.1-<lb/>25.5 μM range (Table 1). Interestingly, the small differences in the lateral chains of 1, 2 and 3 <lb/>do not affect the potency of inhibition towards the two viral functions. Also quercitrin (6) <lb/>showed to be active in the low micromolar range against both RT-associated functions. Quer-<lb/>citrin (6) is indeed a glycoside of quercetin, a flavonoid which is known to be a potent inhibitor <lb/>of both functions of HIV-1 RT [14,100]. Differently, 1,3,5-benzentriol 2-[(2S,3R)-3-(3,4-dihy-<lb/>droxylphenyl)-2,3-dihydroxylpropyl], known as filiferol (4), exhibited a weak inhibition of <lb/>both HIV-1 RT-associated RNase H and RDDP functions, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, <lb/>namely protocatechuic acid (5), was found inactive at the maximum concentration tested <lb/>(100 μM), similarly to what already found for the structurally-related shikimic acid [14]. <lb/>Table 2.

			<body>Evaluation of the effects H. scruglii chemical components on HIV-1 IN <lb/>activity <lb/>Since HIV-1 RNase H and IN domains have striking similarities, in order to evaluate if the <lb/>compounds able to inhibit HIV-1 RNase H function could act through a multitarget profile, <lb/>we investigated them also on IN catalytic activities. It is well known, in fact, that compounds <lb/>capable to inhibit the HIV-1 RNase H activity may also affect the HIV-1 IN activity <lb/>[15,17,39,45,46,80]. Hence, we evaluated their ability to inhibit the HIV-1 IN strand transfer <lb/>reaction in the presence of the LEDGF/p75 cellular cofactor, using Raltegravir as positive con-<lb/>trol (Table 2). <lb/>Results showed that 3-geranyl-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglucinol (1), 3-geranyl-1-(2&apos;-<lb/>methylpropanoyl)phloroglucinol (2), 3-(13-hydroxygeranyl)-1-(2&apos;-methylbutanoyl)phloroglu-<lb/>cinol (3) inhibited HIV-1 IN activities in presence of LEDGF/p75 with IC 50 values in the 7.3-<lb/>13μM range. Also in this case, results showed that the small differences in the lateral chains of <lb/>1, 2 and 3 do not affect the potency of inhibition on these enzymatic functions. It is worth not-<lb/>ing that these compounds were able to inhibit in similar concentration both RT-associated <lb/>RNase H activity and IN strand transfer function, while they were found to be less active on <lb/>RT-associated RDDP activity. Differently, quercitrin (6) inhibited HIV-1 IN in the low micro-<lb/>molar range, resulting 4-fold more active on HIV-1 IN activity with respect to HIV-1 RNase H <lb/>function. The HIV-1 Integrase (IN) inhibition of its aglycon quercetin has been already <lb/>reported in in vitro assay [101]. Worth to note, the filiferol (4) that weakly inhibited both HIV-<lb/>1 RT-associated RNase H and RDDP functions, were able to inhibit the HIV-1 IN activities in <lb/>presence of LEDGF/p75 with an IC 50 value of 6.4 μM, showing a selectivity for this viral <lb/>enzyme. 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (5), already found inactive on both RT-associated activi-<lb/>ties, was not active also on HIV-1 IN inhibition. <lb/>Inhibition of HIV-1 in cell culture and characterization of the mechanism <lb/>of action of bioactive compounds in cell-based assays <lb/>Given that compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 were able to inhibit both the HIV-1 RT and IN func-<lb/>tions in biochemical assays, we wanted to evaluate their effect on the HIV-1 replication. <lb/>Results showed that compounds 1, 2 and 3 significantly inhibited HIV-1 replication with <lb/>EC 50 values in the 3.5-8 μM range (Fig 4), in accordance with the range of IC 50 values showed <lb/>against the three viral enzymatic functions in biochemical assays, showing no cytotoxic effect <lb/>up to the highest tested concentration in cells (CC 50 &gt; 50 μM) (Table 3). Quercitrin, even if it <lb/>was able of inhibiting both HIV-1 RT-associated activities and IN functions in biochemical <lb/>assay, did not exert any effect on HIV-1 replication at the highest tested concentration <lb/>(Table 3), similarly to what reported for its aglycon quercetin [102]. Since compounds 1, 2 and <lb/>3 were active on both HIV-1 RT and IN in biochemical assays, we asked which was the viral <lb/>process targeted by bioactive compounds and, hence, a time-of-addition experiment on the <lb/>most promising molecule was carried out. This experiment determines how long the addition <lb/>of an anti-HIV compound can be postponed within the viral replication cycle before losing its <lb/>antiviral activity. Reference compounds with a known mode of action such as Maraviroc, <lb/>Lamivudine and Dolutegravir were included. As shown in Fig 5, the compound 3, similarly to <lb/>lamivudine, a RT inhibitor, lost its activity if added after 4-5 hour post-infection. This timing <lb/>is compatible with an anti-RT activity, exerted on both RNase H and RDDP functions, but not <lb/>with IN inhibition [103]. These data demonstrate that compound 3 exerts its anti-HIV activity <lb/>targeting the RT functions, while the anti-IN activity, exhibited only in enzymatic assays, is <lb/>not significantly involved in the inhibition of viral replication. A number of compounds were <lb/>reported to have dual RNase H/IN inhibitory activity in vitro but were more selective for IN <lb/></body>

			<body>and, indeed, they were shown to inhibit the IN in cell-based experiments [104]. Very few com-<lb/>pounds [32,33] were reported to be more selective for RNase H versus IN in vitro and were <lb/>shown to inhibit the RT in cell-based experiments. Hence, it is possible that a dual inhibitory <lb/>activity displayed in enzymatic assays, is not supported by cell-based results, but at our knowl-<lb/>edge, no much data are available on such discrepancies on compounds that were shown to <lb/>have equal potency of inhibition in vitro on the two enzymes. Therefore, further studies should <lb/>be performed to elucidate this specific behavior and to obtain derivatives of compound 3 that <lb/>may be active on viral replication targeting both viral enzymes. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>Searching for new potential multitarget anti-HIV active compounds form Sardinian endemic <lb/>flora, we successfully identified in Hypericum scruglii some chemical components able to <lb/>Fig 4.

Among the <lb/>bioactive compounds, two known phloroglucinol derivatives, compounds 1 and 2, and a <lb/>newly identified acylphloroglucinol, compound 3, were also able to inhibit the virus replication <lb/>in cell-based assays.
