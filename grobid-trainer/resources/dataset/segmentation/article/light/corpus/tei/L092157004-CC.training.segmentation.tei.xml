			<body>Sodium cobalt oxide, Na x CoO 2 (x ≈ 0.65 to 0.75), <lb/>has received considerable attention due to its unusual <lb/>thermal electric properties.[1] Recent studies have re-<lb/>vealed anomalous non-Fermi liquid behavior in trans-<lb/>port properties which point to the importance of strong <lb/>correlations.[2, 3] The cobalt ions form a hexagonal lay-<lb/>ered structure and the formally 1−x fraction is in the low <lb/>spin (S = 1 <lb/>2 ) Co 4+ state, while the x fraction is in the <lb/>S = 0 Co 3+ state. Interest in this material escalated with <lb/>the discovery of superconductivity by Takada et al.[4] in <lb/>Na x CoO 2 • yH 2 O when the sodium concentration is re-<lb/>duced to about 0.3 and water is intercalated between the <lb/>layers. The ability to control the sodium content is an <lb/>exciting development because, in principle, the limit of <lb/>x = 0 corresponds to a Mott insulator on a triangular <lb/>lattice with S = 1 <lb/>2 . Then the hydrated compound can <lb/>be viewed as electron doping of a Mott insulator with a <lb/>doping concentration x ≈ 0.3. As such, it is the second <lb/>known example of superconductivity arising from dop-<lb/>ing a Mott insulator after the high T c cuprates. The <lb/>S = 1 <lb/>antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice was in fact <lb/>the starting point of Anderson&apos;s resonating valence bond <lb/>(RVB) idea,[5] and the new superconductor has been in-<lb/>terpreted in this light.[6, 7, 8] <lb/>Until recently, the bulk properties of superconducting <lb/>Na 0.3 CoO 2 • 1.3H 2 O has been studied mostly using pow-<lb/>der samples.[9, 10, 11, 12, 13] Single crystal measure-<lb/>ments [13] are much less plentiful, though such measure-<lb/>ments are extremely important in order to understand <lb/>this anisotropic layered compound. In this paper we re-<lb/>port a new electrochemical method to extract Na from <lb/>Na x CoO 2 . This is an alternative to the chemical de-<lb/>intercalation of Na using Br ions introduced by Takada <lb/>et al.[4] Our electrochemical method permits precise con-<lb/>trol of the Na content and avoids the environmental haz-<lb/>ards associated with the use of high molar concentra-<lb/>tions of Br. In addition, we have succeeded in growing <lb/>large single crystals of Na x CoO 2 by the floating zone (FZ) <lb/>method. By applying the electrochemical procedure to <lb/>the FZ crystals, we have obtained superconducting single <lb/>crystal samples with which we have carried out a variety <lb/>of physical property measurements. <lb/>The initial Na 0.75 CoO 2 polycrystalline material was <lb/>prepared using Na 2 CO 3 and Co 3 O 4 with Na to Co ratio <lb/>at 0.75 to 1. The thoroughly mixed and ground powder <lb/>was calcined at 750C for 12 hours and then reacted at <lb/>850C for 24 hours with frequent grindings in between. <lb/>Na loss was minimized with a fast-heating method.[14] <lb/>A stoichiometric Na 0.75 CoO 2 feed rod was melted and <lb/>re-crystallized with an optical floating-zone furnace (4-<lb/>Xe lamp design, CSI Japan) under oxygen atmosphere. <lb/>Although Na vapor loss was observed from the white de-<lb/>posit on the walls of the quartz sample chamber, this loss <lb/>was minimized by choosing a fast pulling rate. A stable <lb/>molten zone can be maintained with various pulling rates <lb/>from 1.5 to 10 mm/hr. Electron probe microscopy anal-<lb/>ysis (EPMA) indicates the FZ crystal has Na content <lb/>between 0.71 and 0.74 for a crystal pulled with 2 mm/hr <lb/>rate. We have grown large single crystals of Na 0.75 CoO 2 <lb/>(5mm diameter × cm long) successfully with this FZ <lb/>method. Powder neutron diffraction confirms that the <lb/>Na level of the FZ crystal is essentially identical to that <lb/>in the feed rod.[15] <lb/>A three-electrode electrochemical cell was set up using <lb/>the Na x CoO 2 sample as a working electrode, platinum <lb/>foil as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as a reference elec-<lb/>trode (E 0 = +0.222 V vs. the standard hydrogen elec-<lb/>trode), and 1M NaOH as an electrolyte. The proposed <lb/>half reaction at the anodically polarized Na x CoO 2 elec-<lb/>trode responsible for Na extraction is <lb/>N a x CoO 2 + δ(OH) − → N a x−δ CoO 2 + δ(N aOH) + δe − , <lb/>where the generated NaOH becomes dissolved in the <lb/>electrolyte. Because Na x CoO 2 is metallic, the work-<lb/></body>

The arrows indicate <lb/>regions of special stability and are labelled with possible Na <lb/>concentrations associated with these regions. <lb/>ing electrode can be prepared directly using a com-<lb/>pressed powder or a single crystal sample. Hydrated <lb/>Na 0.3 CoO 2 • yH 2 O can be prepared by having the sam-<lb/>ple anodically polarized with a constant voltage (0.6-1.2 <lb/>V) until the decaying anodic current reaches a constant <lb/>value. Alternatively, a constant current (of 0.1-10 mA) <lb/>can be used to achieve the same charge level by wait-<lb/>ing until the final open circuit potential reaches ∼ 0.5 <lb/>V vs. Ag/AgCl. Samples obtained directly from the cell <lb/>are typically in a mixture of the partially hydrated [9] <lb/>(c ≃ 13.8Å) and fully hydrated (c ≃ 19.7Å) structures <lb/>and show only trace amounts of superconductivity. Fully <lb/>hydrated superconducting crystals can be achieved by <lb/>sealing the sample in a water vapor saturated container <lb/>at room temperature. We find that the rate of hydration <lb/>depends on grain size and several months are required <lb/>to fully hydrate mm-sized single crystals. The sodium <lb/>content in each sample was checked by electron probe <lb/>microanalysis. After electrochemical treatment, our as-<lb/>prepared floating-zone single crystals with x = 0.75 typ-<lb/>ically break apart into smaller crystals (∼5×5×2 mm) <lb/>with x ≃ 0.28 − 0.32. <lb/>The quasi-open circuit potential (OCP) was measured <lb/>as a function of time during a repeated sequence of hav-<lb/>ing a current density of 0.01 A/g turned on (for 100 sec-<lb/>onds) and off (for 100 seconds). Here, the quasi OCP <lb/>is the potential recorded during the time the current is <lb/>off. We can interpret the OCP measured in this manner <lb/>as the chemical potential of the surface layer of the sam-<lb/>ple. In Fig. 1 we plot the quasi-OCP vs. time where the <lb/>charging current density is 0.01 A/g. The time axis is <lb/>therefore proportional to the total charge supplied to the <lb/>sample surface. A plateau in the OCP corresponds to <lb/>two-phase coexistence. We can identify three prominent <lb/>plateaus in Fig. 1. The last plateau at 0.48 volts indi-<lb/>cates a saturation of the Na concentration, at least on <lb/>the surfaces of the grains of the crystal.

Inset: The AC susceptibilities (in-phase χ ′ and out-of-<lb/>phase χ ′′ ) at low temperatures. <lb/>that the starting material is Na 0.75 , we have drawn ar-<lb/>rows in Fig. 1 to indicate the expected Na content with <lb/>the assumption that the Na extraction is proportional to <lb/>the charging. The close match of these arrows with the <lb/>plateaus suggests that stable intermediate phases exist <lb/>for Na 2/3 and Na 1/2 . We speculate that the special frac-<lb/>tions of x ≃ 1 <lb/>3 , 1 <lb/>2 , and 2 <lb/>3 may be indicative of at least <lb/>partial Na ordering relative to the hexagonal Co struc-<lb/>ture. The role of Na ordering on the physics of these <lb/>materials is an important subject for future studies. <lb/>Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and resistivity <lb/>have been measured on our superconducting single crys-<lb/>tal samples. As shown in Fig. 2, the susceptibility <lb/>shows a large anisotropy, similar to that reported for <lb/>Na 0.68 CoO 2 .[2] However, the Curie-Weiss susceptibility <lb/>that is so prominent there is now absent. The small cusp <lb/>at 42 K is likely due to a Co 3 O 4 impurity phase, which <lb/>is known to have an antiferromagnetic transition in the <lb/>33 to 46 K range.[16] By comparing the size the magne-<lb/>tization cusp with that for bulk Co 3 O 4 , we estimate that <lb/>the Co 3 O 4 impurity fraction of our sample is small, at <lb/>the 1% level. However, we cannot detect the existence <lb/>of Co 3 O 4 within our x-ray diffraction sensitivity. Apart <lb/>from this anomaly and the low temperature Curie tail <lb/>(which arises from only 0.5% of the Co moments), the <lb/>susceptibility is nearly temperature independent. Note <lb/>the large magnitude and strong anisotropy. For compar-<lb/>ison, the magnitude is about 5 times that of lanthanum <lb/>strontium cuprate (La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 ) and 30 times that of <lb/>a simple metal like Na. The anisotropy is probably due <lb/>to a combination of anisotropy in the g factor and the <lb/>van Vleck term. AC susceptibility measurements were <lb/>taken in a field of 3 Gauss/100 Hz as shown in the inset <lb/>of Fig. 2. The diamagnetic signal is indicative of a su-<lb/>perconducting phase with an onset temperature of about <lb/>4.2 K, and the screening fraction is estimated to be about <lb/>120% (without geometric correction). <lb/>The specific heat of an array of co-aligned single crys-<lb/></body>

			<body>tals (combined mass of 4.7 mg) was measured using a <lb/>Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum De-<lb/>sign) in applied magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 14 <lb/>T and temperatures ranging from 0.37 K to K as <lb/>shown in Fig. 3. The sample had been hydrated for three <lb/>months after electrochemical de-intercalation, and x-ray <lb/>diffraction indicates that 94% of the sample consists of <lb/>the fully hydrated superconducting structure. In zero <lb/>field, a pronounced peak is observed at 4.2 K, indicating <lb/>the transition to bulk superconductivity. A second broad <lb/>peak exists at lower temperature around 1.5 K. In a field <lb/>of 1 T, the superconducting anomaly at 4.2 K is strongly <lb/>suppressed; in contrast, the peak at 1.5 K is slightly en-<lb/>hanced. This suggests that the peak around 1.5 K is <lb/>not related to a second superconducting phase with a <lb/>lower T c . Such a peak may be compatible with a model <lb/>of weakly interacting localized Co moments, analogous to <lb/>the effects seen in impurity-doped semiconductors.[17] In <lb/>fields larger than 5 T, both peaks disappear and are re-<lb/>placed by a broad enhancement of C/T over a wide range <lb/>of temperatures. With increasing field, the enhancement <lb/>of C/T shifts to higher temperatures. <lb/>In the inset of Fig. 3, the top panel compares the sup-<lb/>pression of the superconducting anomaly for H c and <lb/>H ab. In order to achieve a comparable suppression, <lb/>an in-plane field with magnitude 5 times that of the the <lb/>out-of-plane field is required. This reflects the anisotropy <lb/>of H c2 in the different field orientations and is consistent <lb/>with our resistivity measurements of H c2 (discussed be-<lb/>low). We note that ∆C/T c in zero-field for our single <lb/>crystal sample is comparable to that reported by other <lb/>groups in powder samples.[11, 12] The data plotted in <lb/>the main part of Fig. 3 exhibit an upturn at the lowest <lb/>measured temperatures which increases with increasing <lb/>field. This is most likely due to a Schottky contribution <lb/>from the nuclear spins. The bottom panel of the inset <lb/>shows C/T data at high-fields in which a nuclear Schot-<lb/>tky contribution (6.7×10 −6 B 2 /T 2 ) has been subtracted. <lb/>These data demonstrate that in fields greater than ∼10 T <lb/>superconductivity is completely suppressed. Hence, 10 T <lb/>may be taken as an upper limit for H c2 with H ab. <lb/>On different single crystal sample which had a smaller <lb/>hydrated phase fraction, we had observed an anomaly in <lb/>the specific heat at T = 6 K. This feature is also notice-<lb/>able in the powder data of Jin et al.,[13]. We found that <lb/>this anomaly was insensitive to magnetic fields as large <lb/>as 14 T. The origin of this anomaly is not clear, and it <lb/>may be related to another order parameter in the vicinity <lb/>of the superconducting phase on the phase diagram. <lb/>From our specific heat data, we extract a normal state <lb/>γ value of 16.6 mJ/K Co-mole. This corresponds to <lb/>a free electron density of states (DOS) including both <lb/>spins of 7.09 states/eV. At first sight, this seems to com-<lb/>pare well with the LDA band structure result[18] of 4.4 <lb/>states/eV. However, this apparent agreement is mislead-<lb/>ing because the LDA band consists of 3 overlapping t 2g <lb/>0 <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>6 <lb/>7 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0.07 <lb/>0.08 <lb/>1 <lb/>10 <lb/>0.01 <lb/>0.02 <lb/>0.03 <lb/>0.04 <lb/>0.05 <lb/>0.06 <lb/>0 <lb/>10 <lb/>20 <lb/>30 <lb/>40 <lb/>0.020 <lb/>0.025 <lb/>0.030 <lb/>0.035 <lb/>C <lb/>p <lb/>/T <lb/>(J/K <lb/>2 <lb/>mol) <lb/>T (K) <lb/>14 <lb/>10 <lb/>5 <lb/>1 <lb/>0.2 <lb/>0 <lb/>H (T) <lb/>H || c <lb/>T <lb/>2 (K <lb/>2 <lb/>) <lb/>10 T, H || c <lb/>14 T, H || c <lb/>10 T, H || ab <lb/>14 T, H || ab <lb/>T <lb/>0.2 T, H || c <lb/>T, H || ab <lb/>FIG. 3: The specific heat measured on a single crystal plot-<lb/>ted as cp/T versus T in various applied magnetic fields. In <lb/>the top panel of the inset, we plot cp/T versus T 2 showing <lb/>the suppression of the superconducting anomaly for H c and <lb/>H ab. In the bottom panel of the inset, we plot cp/T for fields <lb/>of 10 T and 14 T (a nuclear Schottky contribution has been <lb/>subtracted). <lb/>bands whereas the true quasiparticle is expected to form <lb/>a single band out of the A 1g orbital (symmetric combina-<lb/>tion of t 2g ), split off from the rest by correlation. A better <lb/>way is to extract a bandwidth which we estimate to be <lb/>1.4 eV. Even though the LDA calculation was done for <lb/>x = 0.5 and without hydration, the bandwidth should <lb/>be insensitive to these differences. On the other hand, <lb/>we can fit the observed DOS to that of the free electron <lb/>tight binding band on a triangular lattice with hopping <lb/>matrix element t ef f . With t ef f &lt; 0 and x = 0.35, the <lb/>tight binding DOS for both spins is 0.16/|t ef f |.[7] The <lb/>measured DOS then implies that |t ef f | ≈ meV, or a <lb/>full bandwidth of 9|t ef f | ≈ 0.2 eV, which is a factor of 7 <lb/>smaller than the LDA bandwith. We therefore conclude <lb/>that there is a mass enhancement of ∼ 7 compared with <lb/>band theory. <lb/>By assuming g = 2, we find that the measured χ c <lb/>of 3.5 × 10 −4 cm 3 /Co-mole corresponds to a free elec-<lb/>tron DOS of 10.86 states/eV. This gives a Wilson ra-<lb/>tio 4π 2 k 2 /3(gµ B ) 2 χ/γ of 1.53. In case a significant <lb/>portion of χ comes from the van Vleck term, the Wil-<lb/>son ratio will be even smaller. The combination of sus-<lb/>ceptibility and specific heat measurements indicate that <lb/>Na 0.3 CoO 2 •yH 2 O may be viewed as a Fermi liquid with <lb/>strong mass enhancement due to correlations.

Low <lb/>temperature results for ρc are shown in an expanded scale in <lb/>the inset. <lb/>rial suggests an electronic rather than phononic mecha-<lb/>nism. <lb/>Four terminal resistivity measurements on a single <lb/>crystal are shown in Fig. 4. The zero resistance state <lb/>is achieved in ρ c and ρ ab at low temperatures below <lb/>T c ≃ 4.2 K (the inset shows an expanded view of ρ c (T ) <lb/>near the transition). The large room-to low-temperature <lb/>resistance ratio (∼40) indicates that the sample is a good <lb/>metal with large anisotropy between ρ c and ρ ab (grow-<lb/>ing to 10 4 at low temperatures). The conductance per <lb/>square at low T of each layer is 50 (e 2 /h), indicative of a <lb/>long mean free path. The current and voltage leads were <lb/>attached with silver paste which was allowed to dry in at-<lb/>mosphere for 12 hours. Even though partial dehydration <lb/>may have occurred during this process, it appears that <lb/>superconductivity in the single crystal sample, with its <lb/>smaller surface-to-volume ratio, is more robust than in <lb/>the powder samples where superconductivity is found to <lb/>degrade in a matter of minutes.[9] The large peak below <lb/>K reported by Jin et al.[13] is absent. <lb/>In order to make an estimate of H c2 , we have measured <lb/>the in-plane resistance R ab versus H at various tempera-<lb/>tures as shown in Fig. 5(a). There are two regimes (at low <lb/>fields and high fields) where the resistance is roughly pro-<lb/>portional to H. We define H c2 as the field at the crossing <lb/>point of the extrapolation of these regimes. In Fig. 5(b), <lb/>we plot H c2 vs. T for both field orientations. There is <lb/>about a factor of 5 difference in the slopes near T c , con-<lb/>sistent with the heat capacity data. The value of H c2 for <lb/>H ab is consistent with the Pauli paramagnetic limit <lb/>for pair breaking. From the H c2 vs. T curve for H c, <lb/>we determine a coherence length of ξ ≈ 100Å. This rela-<lb/>tively short coherence length is surprising for a supercon-<lb/>ductor with such a low T c , but is entirely consistent with <lb/>the narrow bandwidth. Assuming a parabolic band, the <lb/>BCS formula for ξ o can be expressed in terms of the DOS <lb/>ρ(ǫ F ) in the following way: ξ o = vF <lb/>π∆o = <lb/>√ <lb/>3kF a 2 <lb/>2π 2 ρ(ǫF )∆o . Us-<lb/>ing ρ(ǫ F ) = 7.09 eV −1 extracted from specific heat and <lb/>assuming 2∆ o = 3.52 kT c , we obtain ξ o ≈ 27a ≈ 76Å, <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>0.000 <lb/>0.002 <lb/>0.004 <lb/>0.006 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>0.000 <lb/>0.005 <lb/>0.010 <lb/>0.015 <lb/>0.020 <lb/>0.025 <lb/>R <lb/>ab ( ) <lb/>H (T) <lb/>H || ab <lb/>1 <lb/>2 <lb/>3 <lb/>4 <lb/>5 <lb/>0 <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>12 <lb/>H <lb/>c2 <lb/>(T) <lb/>T (K) <lb/>H ||c, <lb/>ab <lb/>H || ab, <lb/>ab <lb/>H || c, <lb/>c <lb/>R <lb/>ab ( ) <lb/>H (T) <lb/>H || c <lb/>(a) <lb/>(b) <lb/>FIG. 5: (a) The in-plane resistance curves R ab (H) measured <lb/>for temperatures ranging from 2.0 K to 4.2 K.
