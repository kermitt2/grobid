			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is an aromatic amino acid hydroxylase and a member of tetrahydropterin dependent. TH <lb/>required tetrahydrobiopterin known as BH 4 as a cofactor, nonheme iron ion, and molecular oxygen as an additional sub-<lb/>strate [1]. In the biosynthesis of dopamine and other catecholamines, TH (EC. 1.14.16.2) speeds up the rate-limiting step. <lb/>Hydroxyl group added at meta and ortho position of L-tyrosine (oxygen oxidoreductase, tyrosine 3&apos;-monooxygenase) for <lb/>producing L-dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alaline) and other catecholamines [2]. Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD) is considered the <lb/>most frequent neurodegenerative illness after Alzheimer&apos;s disease. PD is a human-specific, progressive, and aging-related <lb/>disease. TH enzyme deficiency is suspected in PD [3]. The main symptom of the disease was spontaneous movement <lb/>disorder, known to be caused by a neurochemical disorder that decreases the neurotransmitter dopamine [4]. It is also <lb/>reported that PD as the second most common neurological disorder [5]. PD showed difficulties in diagnosis, treatment, <lb/>and in drug delivery. In the treatment of Parkinson&apos;s disease levodopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine) was considered <lb/>as standard therapeutic agent [6]. Levodopa is colorless, tasteless, slightly soluble in water, and odorless. Typically white, <lb/>crystalline solid or powder with chemical formula C 9 H 11 NO 4 and molecular weight of 197.19 g/mol determined [7]. Dopa <lb/>decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.28) catalysis became the cause of dopamine production by the conversion of L-dopa. Therefore, <lb/>the level of dopamine increased [8]. <lb/>The most significant advancements in nanotechnology have been the manufacturing, exploitation, and employment <lb/>of materials with sizes ranging from a few microns to individual atoms for usage in living organisms through biological <lb/>prospects [9]. A previosu study, declared AgNPs as the most attractive nanomaterials in biomedicine. AgNPs possess <lb/>antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, and anticancer properties with diverse applications in the field of medicinal biology, <lb/>drug delivery, renewable energy, optics, electronics, material sciences [10]. Fungus derived nano particles are being used <lb/>in the agriculture sector as biosensors, nano fertilizers and nano pesticide to promote plant growth [11]. Applications <lb/>of NPs as Anti-oncological agent against glioblastoma have been reported by [12]. A study conducted by [13] silver <lb/>highlights antibacterial effects of nanoparticles (AgNPs) from aqueous seed extract of Myristica fragrans. It confirms that <lb/>biosynthesized AgNPs have strong antibacterial effect on S. typhi growth. It is also reported that antibacterial effect of <lb/>green AgNPs produced from red algae Amphiroa rigida [14]. Various researchers have reported antibacterial effect [15] <lb/>of Nps specifically AgNPs produced from different sources such as plants [16], microbes [17], fungus [18]. <lb/>NPs synthesis includes phytofabrication physical and chemical preparation microbial synthesis [19], and biological <lb/>means including bacteria, fungi, virus [20] and plant extract [21]. Nanoparticles are used for a variety of purposes, includ-<lb/>ing medical therapeutic applications, energy storage in solar and oxide fuel batteries, optical devices, bactericidal agents, <lb/>electronic devices, biological labeling, cosmetics, clothing, and anti-cancerous agents. Nanoparticles have received a lot <lb/>of attention because of their outstanding qualities, which include antimicrobial activity, great resistance to oxidation, <lb/>and high thermal conductivity [22]. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are vital to nanomedicine and other fields related to <lb/>nanoscience and nanotechnology. Electronics, biosensing, clothes, food industry, sunscreens, textiles, photonics, paints, <lb/>cosmetics, electronics, antimicrobicides, and medical equipment all utilized AgNPs. AgNPs have ample utilization in a <lb/>diverse range of consumer products like food, cloth, pastes, soaps, plastics, and textiles metal due to their wide range of <lb/>antifungicidal and antibacterial effects [23]. <lb/>Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the production of catecholamine&apos;s. This enzyme converts <lb/>tyrosine to dopamine. TH deficiency is related to Parkinsonism. Tyrosine hydroxylase acts as a catalyst in the conversion <lb/>of L-tyrosine into levodopa. It&apos;s important to maintain the structure and functionality of TH because it&apos;s a complicated <lb/>and unstable enzyme. To improve enzyme stability and reduce L-dopa titer, enzyme immobilization has been suggested. <lb/>The present study targeted the immobilization of tyrosine hydroxylase extracted from Agaricus arvensis on AgNPs for <lb/>enhanced stability and improved catalytic efficiency towards L-dopa production. Immobilization of TH improved its <lb/>activity. Moreover, stable and more L-dopa production was associated with immobilization. The activity of TH could be <lb/>enhanced by its immobilization so that more and stable L-dopa could be produced. <lb/></body>

		<body>2 Materials and methods <lb/>The premium-grade chemicals were employed to revolutionize this research and procured from different purveyors of <lb/>Acros Organics (Belgium), Daejung Chemicals (South Korea), Fisher Scientific (U.S.), and Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). <lb/>2.1 Collection and pre-treatment of Agaricus arvensis biomass <lb/>Agaricus arvensis commonly known as horse mushroom, collected from the Department of Botany, GC University Lahore. <lb/>This mushroom was preserved in a citric-saline solution (10X, pH 7.0). The fruiting body of the mushroom was cleaned <lb/>properly with deionized water before being divided into thin slices. The extra water and moisture were absorbed by <lb/>Whatman filter paper No.1. <lb/>2.2 Preparation of mushroom extract <lb/>A. arvensis washed several times with deionized water and sliced into several thin slices from the mushroom cap. A sliced <lb/>mushroom of 1.25 g was weighed and boiled in 25 ml of distilled water on a hot plate (MSH: 20-A, wisd, wisestir, Ger-<lb/>many) in a conical flask of 250 ml for 3 min. After boiling, the solution was allowed to cool down to room temperature. <lb/>Afterwards, filtration was performed by using Whatman filter paper No.1 and underwent spectrophotometry at 575 nm <lb/>with UV-V spectrophotometer (UV-9000, HT Company, Ilford, U.K.). The rest of the filtrate was stored at 4 °C and used as <lb/>a reducing agent and stabilizer. The spectroscopy was performed 3 times so the average could be taken. The distilled <lb/>water was operated as blank [24]. <lb/>2.3 Optimization of mushroom extract <lb/>Different weights (% w/v) of mushrooms were enumerated in distilled water and peptone saline to find out the super-<lb/>lative mushroom biomass. Mushroom biomass of 2 and 2.5% (w/v) was taken in 25 ml of distilled water and peptone <lb/>saline. Later, TH assay was performed. Mushroom biomass of 2% w/v (0.5 g) and 2.5% w/v (0.625 g) was evaluated to <lb/>investigate the efficient mushroom biomass. The evaluation of different extraction temperatures was preceded at 50, <lb/>60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 °C in a boiling water bath (WB-22 Wisebath, wisd, Wertgeum, Germany). TH assay was performed <lb/>after extraction. Filtrates were analyzed by UV-visible spectrophotometry. <lb/>2.4 Aerobic biotransformation reaction <lb/>The modified protocol was followed for aerobic biotransformation reactions for L-dopa synthesis from L-tyrosine using <lb/>mushroom extract as a source of tyrosinase in the reaction mixture. Twenty-five milliliters of 50 mM acetate buffer (pH 3.5) <lb/>comprising 2.5 mg/ml L-tyrosine, 5 mg/ml L-ascorbic acid along with 1 ml of mushroom extract was used. The reactions <lb/>were performed aerobically at 50 ºC for 60 min and 80 rpm using a shaking water bath (WB-14, Memmert, Schwabach, <lb/>Germany). The biochemical samples were collected and centrifuged (4000 rpm, 15 min) using a centrifuge (3K30, Sigma <lb/>Laboratory Centrifuges). <lb/>2.5 Analytical techniques <lb/>2.5.1 Tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme activity assay <lb/>The analytical technique followed the procedures laid down by [25, 26]. Supernatant (0.1 ml) was taken in a test tube. <lb/>L-ascorbic acid (0.1 ml), EDTA (0.1 ml), and L-tyrosine (0.1 ml) with the addition of 2.6 ml phosphate buffer (pH 7.2, 50 mM) <lb/>were added in a test tube. The components were fully combined and left at room temperature (30 °C) for 10 min. A 310nm <lb/>measured till it becomes steady. The reduction in absorption was monitored every minute for a total of 5 min. One <lb/>enzyme activity unit is equal to a ΔA265nm of 0.01 per min at 25 °C, pH 7.2 in 3 ml of reaction mixture that contains <lb/>L-ascorbic acid and L-catechol. The following formula was used to measure enzyme activity: <lb/></body>

			<body>2.5.2 Catalytic efficiency and stability of TH <lb/>The catalytic stability of tyrosine hydroxylase was estimated by TH assay with free enzyme extract as well as with immo-<lb/>bilized enzyme. The reusability of immobilized tyrosinase was estimated by performing TH assay with 0.1 ml of immobi-<lb/>lized AgNPs at 40 °C with the incubation time of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min. Afterward, the OD was taken at A 310nm. This <lb/>was the first cycle. After the first cycle falcons were subjected to centrifugation (5000 rpm, 15 min). The supernatant was <lb/>discarded. The pellets were used for TH assay. All the contents of the falcons were vortex and incubated for 5, 10, 15, 20, <lb/>25, and 30 min, in parallel. After incubation, the absorbance was taken. Two more cycles were performed by following <lb/>the prior mentioned method. <lb/>2.5.3 L-Dopa synthesis and L-tyrosine consumption <lb/>Free enzymes and immobilized enzymes produced after biotransformation were used for L-tyrosine consumption and <lb/>L-dopa synthesis. The biotransformation was performed aerobically at 50 °C for 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, and 120 min <lb/>using a shaking water bath (80 rpm). L-tyrosine consumption was estimated by taking one milliliter of supernatant <lb/>with 1 ml of mercuric sulphate reagent. The tubes were kept for 10 min in a hot water-bath. After cooling, 1 ml of nitrite <lb/>reagent along with 1 ml of distilled water was added to it. The volume was increased to 5 ml. At 545 nm, the OD was <lb/>determined using a spectrophotometer (35). The amount of consumed L-tyrosine was determined from the equations <lb/>viz. y = 0.2105 + 0.0008, 0.2105 = y + 0.0008, and X = <lb/>y+0.0008 <lb/>0.2105 . <lb/>L-dopa synthesis was estimated by taking 1 ml of supernatant (free and immobilized enzyme) in a test tube with 1 ml <lb/>of 0.5 N HCl along with 1 ml of nitrite molybdate reagent (NMR). Control was also run in parallel (35). One milliliter of 1 N <lb/>NaOH became the cause of a crimson hue when added. With distilled water, the entire capacity was topped out to 5 ml. <lb/>After 3 min at 545 nm, the OD was taken using a spectrophotometer. The amount of L-dopa produced was determined <lb/>from the equations viz. <lb/>2.6 Statistical analysis <lb/>Significant difference among three parallel replicates has been represented with mean ± standard deviation. Origin95 <lb/>software was used to draw all the plots. XRD pattern was drawn using X&apos; pert High Score. Size distribution histogram <lb/>data was collected from ImageJ software. The p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant [27]. <lb/>2.7 Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgA-AgNPs) <lb/>Nano-silver formation was observed when the cell-free extract of A. arvensis (3 ml) was mixed with 7 ml of AgNO 3 (24 mM). <lb/>Mushroom extract with AgNO 3 was placed for 90 min at 70 °C and 120 rpm in a shaking water bath. The color of the <lb/>reaction mixture changed from transparent (before the addition of supernatant) to light yellow (after the addition of <lb/>supernatant) then dark brown to orange-red (after the incubation of 90 min). Maximum intensity after 90 min observed <lb/>during the period of incubation, indicative of the formation of AgA-AgNPs. The change in the color of the reaction mixture <lb/>corresponded to the synthesis of AgA-AgNPs. Control without silver ions showed no change in the color of the cell filtrates <lb/>when incubated under the same conditions [8]. The green synthesized nanoparticles were centrifuged. To acquire the <lb/>pellet, centrifugation was carried out for 20 min at 6000 rpm. After discarding the supernatant, the particle was rinsed <lb/>twice, once with distilled water and once with ethanol. To evaporate the ethanol, the pellet was stored in the dark at 25 °C <lb/>for the whole night. Using a pestle and mortar, the dry pellet was ground into a fine powder and stored for further study. <lb/>Tyrosine hydroxylase activity (U∕mg) = <lb/>ΔA310 nm∕min (test) -ΔA310 nm∕min (control) <lb/>0.01 mg enzyme∕reaction mixture <lb/>y = 1.9945x + 0.0008, 1.9945 = y + 0.0005, and X = <lb/>y + 0.0005 <lb/>1.9945 <lb/></body>

			<body>2.8 Characterization of AgNPs and AgA-AgNPs <lb/>2.8.1 UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV/VIS spectroscopy) <lb/>A bio-reduction reaction revealed the solution&apos;s change in hue. A UV-Vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the <lb/>immobilized AgNPs&apos; surface plasmon resonance in a reaction mixture. UV-Vis spectroscopy was executed by means of a <lb/>UV-Visible spectrophotometer (Cary 60, Versio 2) in the Nanotechnology lab, GC University Lahore using quartz cuvette at <lb/>25 ℃. The wavelength ranged from 200 to 800 nm. The sample was made under the previously mentioned, optimized condi-<lb/>tions and diluted to a concentration of 10 ppm. Prior to measuring the sample, the UV-VIS spectrophotometer was calibrated <lb/>in accordance with the manufacturer&apos;s instructions, and a baseline correction was performed [28]. <lb/>2.8.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) <lb/>The free silver nanoparticles and AgA-AgNPs solution freeze-dried overnight before analysis. With a few slight modifica-<lb/>tions, the same procedure was employed for the synthesis of free AgNPs that was followed to create AgA-AgNPs. The func-<lb/>tional groups with capping and reducing characteristics were identified by FTIR analysis. For FTIR analysis, liquid samples of <lb/>biogenic AgA-AgNPs and free AgNPs were sent to CASP GC University in Lahore. The spectra were recorded using an FTIR <lb/>spectrophotometer (Spectrum-100, Perkin-Elmer, and St. Louis, USA). Percentage transmittance evaluated at a range of <lb/>400-4000 cm -1 and 25 °C [29]. <lb/>2.8.3 X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD) <lb/>The crystalline nature of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles was determined by operating continuous scanning in the <lb/>range of 5-80° angles. The powder sample of AgA-AgNPs was sent to the Central Research Lab, Lahore College for Women <lb/>University (LCWU) for XRD analysis. XRD machine (D8 discover, Bruker) in the 2θ range 5°-80° with scan speed 1 determined <lb/>the crystalline nature of the AgA-AgNPs [22]. <lb/>2.8.4 Metallurgical microscopy <lb/>AgA-AgNPs were subjected to metallurgical microscopy (5501W, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) from the Center for Advanced <lb/>Studies in Physics (CASP), GC University, Lahore. The powder form of AgA-AgNPs was mixed with a few drops of distilled then <lb/>placed on a micro slide for microscopy. Metallurgical microscopy was conducted at 20X and 100X resolution. The light in the <lb/>metallurgical microscope intermingled with the sample and created numerous optical signals [30]. <lb/>2.8.5 Zeta potential measurement <lb/>The powdered sample of AgA-AgNPs was conveyed to Syed Babar Ali School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University <lb/>of Management Sciences (LUMS) for Zeta potential analysis. The sample undergone sonication and was then examined by <lb/>Zeta sizer Nano ZS instruments (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Zetasizer Ver. 7.10). The AgA-AgNPs&apos; stability was illustrated by the <lb/>zeta potential. A 2 mm adjustment was made to the measuring location. The test was conducted at a count rate of 253.3 <lb/>kcps and in the room temperature range of -150 to 150 mV apparent zeta potential [31]. <lb/>2.8.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) <lb/>The dimensions, form, and surface morphology of AgA-AgNPs were examined using SEM, SEM was used to determine the <lb/>shape and size distribution. AgA-AgNPs in powder form were sent to LCWU&apos;s Central Research Laboratory for SEM examina-<lb/>tion. The scanning electron microscope (EVOLS10, ZEISS) observed the size distribution of biogenic AgNPs [32]. <lb/></body>

			<body>3 Results and discussion <lb/>3.1 Extraction of tyrosine hydroxylase from the pre-treated mushroom biomass <lb/>3.1.1 Evaluation of assay time for better TH activity <lb/>The optimization of TH assay over different time intervals [supp.1] was evaluated and exhibited in Fig. 1. TH activity <lb/>(U/mg) was estimated at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min intervals. Spectrophotometry evaluated the results. Tyrosine hydroxylase <lb/>was extracted from fresh edible mushroom Agaricus arvensis. The assay was performed after enzyme extraction with <lb/>phosphate buffer having a pH of 7.2 [supp.2]. This pH minimizes the spontaneous oxidation of dopa to melanin, the <lb/>rate of which increases with increasing pH [33]. The temperature of incubation was 30 ℃. The enzyme activity was <lb/>12.4 U/mg at 1 min time intervals recorded as the lowest enzyme activity. Enzyme activity was increased with an <lb/>increase in time initially. The enzyme activity was 25.3 U/mg at 2 min time intervals. The highest enzyme activity was <lb/>55.7 U/mg obtained after 3 min. Subsequently, there was a visible decline in TH activity was recorded at 45.2 and <lb/>33.5 U/mg with 4 and 5 min, respectively. Therefore, the time interval of 3 min was optimized for TH assay [supp.3]. <lb/>Similar results were reported when [34] optimized TH assay spectrometry after 5 min of incubation. However [33], <lb/>reported 6 min optimal for TH assay spectrometry. <lb/>3.1.2 Optimization of mushroom biomass for TH extraction <lb/>Figure 2 indicates the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the optimization of mushroom biomass % (w/v) for TH extrac-<lb/>tion. For this purpose, 2 and 2.5% (w/v) mushroom biomass were analyzed by using UV-VIS spectroscopy. The fruiting <lb/>body of mushroom is sliced and heated for TH extraction. The homogeneously dispersed solutions were analyzed at <lb/>different wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm. The peak obtained for 2% (w/v) mushroom biomass was lowered <lb/>to 2.5% (w/v) mushroom biomass with an absorbance of 0.64 (a.u). The highest absorption peak was obtained for <lb/>0.625 g (2.5%, w/v) at 260 nm with an absorbance 0.69 (a.u). The absorbance was 1.07-fold higher than 2% mushroom <lb/>biomass. Therefore, the spectrum indicated that 2.5% of mushroom biomass supported an efficacious extraction <lb/>process. The TH activity was increased when a higher %, w/v mushroom biomass was used. The reason behind this <lb/>is that more biologically active metabolites were available to increase the activity of enzymes [35]. In a similar study <lb/>[36], reported 0.750 g of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus tuber-regium) for enzyme extraction. Moreover [37], reported <lb/>the synthesis of AgNPs from Pleurotus florida, an edible mushroom. The extract of this mushroom was obtained using <lb/>5 g of P. florida. <lb/>Fig. 1 Extraction of the <lb/>Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and <lb/>optimization assay over differ-<lb/>ent time intervals <lb/></body>

			<body>3.1.3 Optimization of extraction media <lb/>Figure 3 shows UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the optimization of different extraction media for TH extraction from <lb/>A. arvensis. The results were scrutinized using UV/Vis spectroscopy. The absorbance with distilled water was 0.73 (a.u) <lb/>at 260 nm. The absorbance of mushroom extract with peptone-saline was 0.88 (a.u) at 260 nm. The absorbance of TH <lb/>activity with peptone-saline as an extractant was 1.20-fold higher as compared to distilled water [supp.4]. After, 260 nm <lb/>there was a sudden decline in the absorbance till 300 nm wavelength. The absorbance became steady after 300 nm. <lb/>Therefore, peptone-saline was selected as the optimal extractant for TH extraction from A. arvensis. The findings of this <lb/>work contradict with [29], who reported the extraction of TH from A. bisporus in distilled water as extractant. Moreover <lb/>[8], worked on the extraction of TH from A. bisporus in distilled water as an extractant also. <lb/>3.1.4 Optimization of temperature for TH extraction <lb/>UV-Vis spectrum for the optimization of temperature for TH extraction was examined. The results are shown in Fig. 4. <lb/>The extraction of TH proceeded with 2.5% (w/v) A. arvensis biomass at 90 and 100 ℃ [supp.5]. The results were analyzed <lb/>by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The peak for 90 ℃ was higher with the absorbance of 2.0 (a.u). The absorbance for 100 ℃ was <lb/>1.4 (a.u). The peak maxima were obtained at 260 nm for 90 ℃ with 1.42-fold higher absorbance as compared to 100 ℃. <lb/>Enzymes are proteins in nature that have three-dimensional shapes and specific configurations. An increase in tempera-<lb/>ture from optimum caused denaturation of the enzyme and lowered its enzyme activity [38]. However, A. bisporus boiled <lb/>Fig. 2 UV-Vis absorption <lb/>spectrum of the optimization <lb/>of mushroom biomass for <lb/>the Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) <lb/>extraction <lb/>Fig. 3 UV-Vis spectrum of <lb/>different extraction mediums <lb/>on the activity of the Tyrosine <lb/>hydroxylase (TH) <lb/></body>

			<body>at 100 ℃ for TH extraction [39]. Jagadish et al. [40] reported the extraction of edible bachu mushroom with highest yield <lb/>of polysaccharides at the temperature of 90℃. <lb/>3.2 Characterization of free and immobilized AgNPs <lb/>3.2.1 Comparative UV absorption spectra of AgA-AgNPs <lb/>AgA-AgNPs were synthesized by reacting 7 ml of 24 mM AgNO 3 concentration along with 3 ml of A. arvensis extract <lb/>level. Comparative AgA-AgNPs UV-Vis spectra were depicted in Fig. 5. The reaction contents were heated for 90 min in <lb/>an orbital water bath for 120 rpm as reported by [8]. The AgA-AgNPs showed dark-brown colour due to the surface plas-<lb/>mon resonance depicted by the NPs [41]. The color of reaction mixture was gained intensity with time due to excitation <lb/>of surface plasmon vibrations in metallic NPs. The UV-Vis spectroscopy of AgA-AgNPs under optimized conditions were <lb/>compared with free AgNPs [supp.6]. The free AgNPs were labelled as A and AgA-AgNPs were highlighted as B in Fig. 5. <lb/>The free AgNPs depicted the peak at 285 nm. While the AgA-AgNPs showed peak at 260 nm. However, there was only <lb/>AgNO 3 in water in case of free AgNPs. There were no AgNPs in the solution of free AgNPs. The absorbance was measured <lb/>for only AgNO 3 [42]. The parameters of AgA-AgNPs synthesis were optimized to get AgA-AgNPs in large numbers. The <lb/>results are in contrast with [43] who reported resishi mushroom based nanoparticles with UV-Vis at 400 nm. Aygun et al. <lb/>[44] reported UV-Vis spectrum at 270-300 nm of green synthesized AgNPs fabricated from polyacrylamide (dextran-<lb/>grafted). Moreover [8], synthesized AgNPs from A. bisporus reported peak at 420 nm. <lb/>Fig. 4 UV-Vis spectrum of <lb/>different temperatures on the <lb/>activity of Tyrosine hydroxy-<lb/>lase (TH) <lb/>Fig. 5 Comparative UV <lb/>Absorption Spectra of AgA-<lb/>AgNPs <lb/></body>

			<body>3.2.2 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy <lb/>The functional groups&apos; roles in the production of AgA-AgNPs were made evident by a distinct FTIR spectrum. In this <lb/>instance, FTIR analysis was performed to detect the presence of biomolecules in free AgNPs and AgA-AgNPs (Table 1). <lb/>The FTIR spectra of immobilized AgA-AgNPs and free AgNPs were depicted in Fig. 6. Peaks of AgA-AgNPs were located <lb/>at 612.94459, 1636.4399, 2123.79028 and 3330. 56226/cm . the peak at 612.94 cm -1 indicating C-H bending of alkynes <lb/>[45]. The peak at 1636.43 cm -1 was ascribed to C = O stretching vibration which indicated that the amino and carboxyl <lb/>groups were successfully modified [46]. Similarly, C≡C functional group was seen at 2123.79 cm -1 . Furthermore, it was <lb/>also confirmed that the carbonyl group from protein and amino acids binds to AgNPs and behaves as stabilizing biomol-<lb/>ecules [45]. A strong absorbance peak was observed at 3330.56 cm -1 was ascribed to the H-O-H bond suggesting the <lb/>binding of silver ions with hydroxyl groups. Free AgNPs showed peaks at 592.12276, 1064.75703, 1392.53197, 1635.60102, <lb/>2980.46036, and 3345.67775/cm -1 . A peak at 592.12 cm demonstrated the nitrites&apos; C-C-C-N group bonding [47]. The <lb/>peak at 1064.75/cm -1 depicted C-H bond stretching of cellulose (63). The peaks at 1392.53, 1635.60 and 2980.46 /cm -1 <lb/>indicated the -C-H-bending, carbonyl stretching, and C-H stretching of polyphenols, amide I group of proteins and <lb/>alkanes [48]. The final peak, at 3345.67/cm, demonstrated the alkenes&apos; C = C stretching. These peaks indicated the pres-<lb/>ence of alkanes, alkenes, ketones and nitrites [49]. <lb/>3.2.3 X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD) <lb/>Silver nanoparticles are crystalline, as shown by XRD analysis. AgA-AgNPs were therefore analyzed using X-ray diffraction <lb/>to determine their phase composition, structural alterations, and crystal structure. Figure 7 represents the XRD pattern <lb/>of AgA-AgNPs. The range of angle 2 theta was 0 to 80°. The instrument was a copper anode and monitored at kα wave-<lb/>length of 0.15406 nm. XRD verified that the silver nanoparticles are crystalline, similar observations were reported by <lb/>[20]. The index of these peaks was found using the X&apos;Pert high score. The X-ray diffraction pattern of freeze-dried silver <lb/>nanoparticles exhibited peaks at 38.8, 46.5, 64.1 and 77.5 o corresponding to (111), (200), (220) and (311), respectively <lb/>confirming the crystalline and face cubic center (fcc) nature of silver nanoparticles. The existence of another prominent <lb/>peak in XRD pattern at around 32 degrees is probably because of the presence of phytochemical compounds [50]. <lb/>Ledeti et al. [8] used A. bisporus to produce AgNPs and the angles of these mycosynthesized nanoparticles correspond <lb/>to (111), (200) and (311), respectively. In another study [48], used the extract of Reishi mushroom for the synthesis of <lb/>silver nanoparticles. The XRD analysis was carried out to confirm the crystalline nature of mycosynthesized AgNPs. The <lb/>angles were found corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes. The results were also correlated with [19], who <lb/>reported silver nanoparticles synthesis from Pyrostegia venusta. They also found the planes of angles at (111), (200), (220) <lb/>and (311) which depicted the formation of fcc AgNPs. <lb/>3.2.4 Metallurgical microscopy of AgNPs <lb/>AgA-AgNPs undergone metallurgical microscopy. This microscopy involved imaging at high magnification. Magnification <lb/>power of 20X and 100X were used to image AgA-AgNPs.

	<div type="annex">zeta potential of AgNPs at -8.5 mV when using Streptomyces albidoflavus for NPs synthesis. Mushroom mediated AgNPs <lb/>were found relatively stable. The silver nanoparticles were also produced by using A. bisporus extract they showed the zeta <lb/>potential of -7.23 mV. These fungus-mediated AgNPs were found stable and well dispersed in the medium [55]. Green <lb/>synthesis of silver nanoparticles from the edible mushroom Pleurotus sajor-caju provided the zeta potential of -8.54 mV <lb/>(74). [11] also reported that NPs stability was observed at negative value (-15.3 mV) in zeta potential. <lb/>3.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) <lb/>The morphology and particle size of biosynthesized AgA-AgNPs were analyzed by SEM (75). AgA-AgNPs SEM images were <lb/>illustrated at 500X, 10,000X and 1.02 KX in Fig. 10. These images confirmed the formation of the irregular, spherical shape <lb/>of AgA-AgNPs, similar observations were reported by [20]. Some agglomerates of AgA-AgNPs were also obtained of 112.6 <lb/>and 228.8 µm width. The particles synthesized from A. arvensis extract were shown with different diameters. Moreover, <lb/>A. arvensis gave rise to agglomerations of spherical or irregular AgA-AgNPs. Agglomeration between some particles <lb/>might be because small nanoparticles are prone to agglomerate because of Van der Waals forces of attraction and can <lb/>be avoided by controlling the capping agent concentration if needed [56] Imagej software was utilized to estimate the <lb/>size of nanoparticles from SEM images. Moreover, Origin95 software proceeded to draw a size distribution histogram. <lb/>Figure 11 depicted the size distribution histogram for AgA-AgNPs that collected the data from Imagej software. The aver-<lb/>age mean size of AgA-AgNPs was found to be 88.49 ± 3.83 nm. The average mean size was found by applying Gaussian <lb/>law. In a similar study, (34) reported the synthesis of AgNPs from mushroom A. bisporus. The size distribution histogram of <lb/>these mycosynthesized NPs showed an average size of 103.57 nm. Loshchinina et al. [57] reported the synthesis of AgNPs <lb/>from the fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides with a diameter 100 nm. Hulikere and Joshi [58] synthesized mushroom-<lb/>mediated AgNPs and found the size from SEM up to 45 nm. <lb/>3.2.7 Evaluation of the reusability of AgA-AgNPs with different incubation time <lb/>The reusability of AgA-AgNPs was evaluated with different incubation times [supp.7]. The results are shown in Fig. 12. <lb/>Different time intervals were used for incubation including 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 min. The reusability of AgA-AgNPs <lb/>was estimated in three cycles. The enzyme activity was estimated at each level. The enzyme activity was 108.2 U/mg <lb/>obtained for the first cycle at 5 min of incubation. The enzyme activity decreased sharply after 5 min of incubation in <lb/>the first cycle. A 1.14-fold higher activity was observed in the first cycle at 5 min of incubation in comparison with the <lb/>second cycle. In the case of second cycle the enzyme activity was 32.2, 67.5 and 88.6 U/mg at 5, 10 and 15 min incuba-<lb/>tion, respectively. The highest enzyme activity was obtained at 20 min and recorded as 94.3 U/mg. After 20 min the <lb/>enzyme activity decreased sharply. Moreover, the third cycle showed enzyme activity of 44.9 U/mg and 62.7 U/mg at 5 <lb/>and 10 min of incubation, respectively. The enzyme activity obtained at 15 min was 81.5 U/mg. After 15 min the enzyme <lb/>activity decreased sharply till 30 min. The enzyme activity was 72.1 U/mg, 64.6 U/mg and 42. 7 U/mg at 20, 25 and 30 min, <lb/>respectively in the third cycle. It was reported that immobilized tyrosinase from A. bisporus showed reusability repeatedly <lb/>and continuously at 40 ℃ to produce L-dopa [59]. Munjal and Sawhney [59] reported improved TH reusability after its <lb/>immobilization on magnetic NPs for five cycles. <lb/>3.2.8 Evaluation of the production of L-dopa <lb/>The evaluation of the production of L-dopa using free enzymes and AgA-AgNPs over a wide range of different time <lb/>intervals was examined [supp.8]. The results are depicted in Fig. 13. The time of biotransformation used for free and <lb/>immobilized enzymes was 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 min. The L-Dopa production (mg/ml) was estimated for free <lb/>enzyme and AgA-AgNPs at each level. The L-Dopa production for free enzyme and AgA-AgNPs was 0.018 mg/ml and <lb/>0.011 mg/ml, respectively at 15 min of biotransformation. L-Dopa production was increased as the time of biotransfor-<lb/>mation was increased. The L-Dopa production was 0.088 mg/ml and 0.224 mg/ml at 90 min for free and immobilized <lb/>enzyme, respectively. The L-Dopa production for AgA-AgNPs was 2.54-fold higher in comparison with the free enzyme. <lb/>The L-Dopa production was decreased sharply after 90 min of biotransformation for both free enzyme and AgA-AgNPs. <lb/>The L-Dopa production was 0.069 mg/ml and 0.054 mg/ml for free enzyme at 105 and 120 min, respectively. Moreover, <lb/>for AgA-AgNPs the L-Dopa production was 0.115 mg/ml and 0.081 mg/ml at 105 and 120 min, respectively. Immobiliza-<lb/>tion increases the stability of enzymes.

			<body>15 min. Initially, the increase in biotransformation time became the cause of the increase in the consumption of L-Tyrosine. <lb/>The highest L-Tyrosine consumption for the free enzyme was 0.312 mg/ml obtained at 90 min. There was a sharp decline <lb/>in L-Tyrosine consumption after 90 min. In contrast, L-Tyrosine consumption for AgA-AgNPs was 0.155 mg/ml at 15 min. <lb/>The highest L-Tyrosine consumption for AgA-AgNPs was 0.554 mg/ml obtained at 90 min. A 1.77-fold higher L-Tyrosine <lb/>consumption was obtained for AgA-AgNPs in comparison with the free enzyme. Consumption of L-tyrosine was 0.450 mg/ <lb/>ml and 0.341 mg/ml at 105 and 120 min, respectively. (82) reported more consumption of L-tyrosine from immobilized TH <lb/>on chiral and non-chiral supports. Tan et al. [61] reported the maximum conversion of L-tyrosine to levodopa in 60 min <lb/>by the fungus Aspergillus oryzae. <lb/>4 Conclusion <lb/>The present work deals with the green synthesis of AgNPs form edible mushroom A. arvensis and the improved stability <lb/>of immobilized TH with catalytic efficiency towards L-dopa production. Silver nanoparticles attract the most attention <lb/>due to their vast bio-medicinal potential. Edible mushrooms contain several biologically active compounds that act as <lb/>reducing and capping agents in the synthesis of AgNPs. The synthesis of mycosynthesized nanoparticles is easy, cheap, <lb/>has simple synthesis steps, non-toxic and there&apos;s no use of hazardous chemicals. Different characterization by UV-VIS <lb/>spectrophotometry, FTIR, XRD and SEM, supported the synthesis of AgA-Ag NPs. The immobilization of TH on AgNPs <lb/>increased its activity as well as its stability and catalytic efficiency. Immobilized TH was found to produce more L-Dopa <lb/>as compared to free enzyme. Furthermore, immobilized TH consumed more L-tyrosine as compared to free enzyme. <lb/>The synthesis of green silver nanoparticles is favored because it is easy to produce with low toxicity. It also plays a vital <lb/>role in human health and safety. Further, scale-up studies are required to improve the activity of TH to produce L-dopa. <lb/></body>
