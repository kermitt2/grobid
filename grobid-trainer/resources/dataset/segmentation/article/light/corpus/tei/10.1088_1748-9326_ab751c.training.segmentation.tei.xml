State-of-the-art SSA parameterizations in global climate models (GCMs) are <lb/>typically modeled using near-surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), and precipitation. <lb/>However, these have non-trivial biases in CMIP3 and CMIP5 GCMs over the tropical Pacific Ocean that <lb/>can contribute to biases in the simulated SSA. This study investigates the impacts of falling ice radiative <lb/>effects on the biases of the aforementioned modeled parameters and the resulting modeled SSA biases. We <lb/>compare the CMIP5 modeled SSA against satellite observations from MISR and MODIS using a pair of <lb/>sensitivity experiments with falling ice radiative effects on and off in the CESM1-CAM5 model. The results <lb/>show that when falling ice radiative effects are not taken into account, models have weaker surface wind <lb/>speeds, warmer SSTs, excessive precipitation, and diluted sea surface salinity (SSS) over the Pacific trade-<lb/>wind regions, leading to underestimated SSA. In the tropical Pacific Ocean, the inclusion of falling ice <lb/>radiative effects leads to improvements in the modeled near-surface wind speeds, SSTs, and precipitation <lb/>through cloud-precipitation-radiation-circulation coupling, which results in more representative patterns <lb/>of SSA and reduces the SSA biases by ∼10% to 15% relative to the satellite observations. Models including <lb/>falling ice radiative effects in CMIP5 produce smaller biases in SSA than those without falling ice radiative <lb/>effects. We suggest that one of the causes of these biases is likely the failure to account for falling ice radiative <lb/>effects, and these biases in turn affect the direct and indirect effects of SSA in the GCMs. <lb/></front>

			<body>1. Introduction <lb/>Despite decades of research, aerosols and clouds con-<lb/>tinue to contribute to large uncertainties in estimates of <lb/>the Earth&apos;s changing energy budget (Boucher et al 2013). <lb/>To reduce these uncertainties, it is essential for atmo-<lb/>spheric models to realistically represent the geographical <lb/>distributions of aerosols; this, in turn, is critical for <lb/>accurate simulation of Earth&apos;s surface energy and water <lb/>budgets. However, the present-day representation of <lb/>aerosols and clouds and, more specifically, their interac-<lb/>tions in general circulation models (GCMs), are major <lb/>contributors to the remaining uncertainties in climate <lb/>change predictions (Seinfeld et al 2016). <lb/>Sea spray aerosol including sea salt aerosols (SSA), <lb/>the largest natural aerosol source, is produced over <lb/>more than 70% of the Earth&apos;s surface and plays an <lb/>important role in the Earth&apos;s radiative budget (Seinfeld <lb/>and Pandis 2006). SSA perturb the radiation budget <lb/>through scattering and absorption of solar radiation <lb/>and emitting thermal infrared radiation (referred to as <lb/>aerosol direct effects). Observations in Nakajima et al <lb/>(2001) showed there is a positive correlation between <lb/></body>

			<body>cloud optical thickness and oceanic aerosol number <lb/>concentration, whereas the effective particle radius has <lb/>a negative correlation with aerosol number concentra-<lb/>tion. Many studies have suggested SSA are the main <lb/>sources of cloud condensation nuclei over the ocean <lb/>(e.g. Pierce and Adams 2006), affecting the micro-<lb/>physical properties of shallow planetary boundary <lb/>layer marine clouds and hence their radiative proper-<lb/>ties, amount, and lifetime (referred to as aerosol indir-<lb/>ect effects). Aerosols are coupled with clouds through <lb/>aerosol indirect effects and semi-direct effects (IPCC <lb/>AR5). Changes in aerosol abundance affect the <lb/>response of trade-wind shallow cumulus, including <lb/>cloud microphysical and macrophysical properties <lb/>(e.g. Xue et al 2008, Saleeby et al 2015), convection <lb/>(e.g. Jiang et al 2018), precipitation (e.g. Kogan et al <lb/>2012), and cloud lifetime (e.g. Jiang et al 2006). Sig-<lb/>nificant discrepancies in aerosol optical depth (AOD) <lb/>between GCMs and satellite observations contribute <lb/>to biases in estimating aerosol direct and indirect <lb/>radiative forcing, and therefore the climate feedback. <lb/>Over the ocean, the main emission of SSA is <lb/>through air bubbles bursting at the air-sea interface, <lb/>meaning the production of SSA is directly affected by <lb/>air-sea interactions such as near surface winds, sea sur-<lb/>face wind stress, sea surface temperature (SST), sea <lb/>surface salinity (SSS), and precipitation (Wood-<lb/>cock 1953, Seinfeld and Pandis 2006). Most para-<lb/>meterizations in GCMs assume that SSA emission has <lb/>a strong dependence on 10 m wind speed (Monahan <lb/>et al 1986). Some parameterizations also include <lb/>dependencies on different meteorological parameters, <lb/>such as SST (Martensson et al 2003, Jaegléet al 2011, <lb/>Witek et al 2016) and SSS (Ovadnevaite et al 2014). <lb/>In the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 <lb/>(CAM5) of the Community Earth System Model version <lb/>1 (CESM1), the parameterization of SSA sources is <lb/>derived from a method proposed by Martensson et al <lb/>(2003), which is based on lab experiment for particles <lb/>with dry diameters ( ) <lb/>D p from 20 to ∼2500 nm. The par-<lb/>ticle flux, F, as a function of whitecap area is expressed as: <lb/>( <lb/>) <lb/>() <lb/>= <lb/>´´+ <lb/>dF <lb/>d <lb/>D <lb/>W <lb/>A SST B <lb/>log <lb/>, <lb/>1 <lb/>p <lb/>where = <lb/>´-<lb/>W <lb/>U <lb/>3.84 10 <lb/>, <lb/>4 <lb/>10 <lb/>3.41 U 10 is the wind speed at <lb/>10 m above the sea surface; A and B are size dependent <lb/>polynomials, with coefficients listed in table 1 of <lb/>Martensson et al (2003). For dry diameters &gt;2-3 mm, <lb/>the parameterization is based on Monahan et al <lb/>(1986), derived as <lb/>= Ć U , <lb/>dF <lb/>d <lb/>D <lb/>log <lb/>10 <lb/>3.41 <lb/>p <lb/>where C is a <lb/>function of particle size. <lb/>Other than SSA produced by breaking waves, the <lb/>depletion of SSA includes wet deposition and dry <lb/>deposition (gravity and turbulence). As the para-<lb/>meterizations are dependent on 10 m wind speed, SST, <lb/>and precipitation, etc, model biases caused by these <lb/>parameters via other dynamical and physical errors <lb/>can lead to errors in the modeled SSA indirectly. One <lb/>cause of the aforementioned model biases could be <lb/>attributed to missing representation of the radiative <lb/>effects of falling ice (snow or precipitating ice) radia-<lb/>tive effects in the models (Li et al 2015; supplementary <lb/>information, available online at stacks.iop.org/ERL/ <lb/>15/034047/mmedia). Li et al (2015) pointed out that <lb/>all the GCMs in the Coupled Model Intercomparison <lb/>Project phase 3 (CMIP3) and most in the phase 5 <lb/>(CMIP5) do not consider precipitating ice radiative <lb/>effects, and these models tend to have too strong con-<lb/>vection, producing anomalous low-level outflow (see <lb/>SI, figure S2(b)) over the Intertropical Convergence <lb/>Zone (ITCZ), South Pacific Convergence Zone <lb/>(SPCZ), and Maritime Continent (See SI, figure S3). <lb/>This leads to weakening surface wind stress, weaker <lb/>low-level winds and upper ocean mixing, resulting in <lb/>warmer SSTs (See SI, figure S4), producing excessive <lb/>precipitation, and diluting SSS over trade-wind <lb/>regions (Li et al 2014, 2016, 2018). The following ques-<lb/>tion will be addressed in this study: to what extent do <lb/>the responses (i.e. weaker surface winds, warmer SSTs, <lb/>and excessive precipitation) from lacking falling ice <lb/>radiative effects contribute to the GCM biases in SSA <lb/>simulations?In other words, what are the impacts on <lb/>local SSA through the remote influence of changes in <lb/>circulation?The SSA biases would in turn affect the <lb/>shallow convection and aerosol direct effects, and thus <lb/>climate feedback. <lb/>In this study, we explore the impacts of missing <lb/>falling ice radiation interactions on aerosol loadings <lb/>parameterized in equation (1) for SSA by conducting a <lb/>pair of sensitivity tests by turning on or off falling ice <lb/>radiative effects in CESM1-CAM5, and comparing the <lb/>results to aerosol data from the Multi-angle Imaging <lb/>SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and MODerate-resolu-<lb/>tion Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>instruments. This paper is structured as follows: <lb/>section 2 includes a brief description of the model <lb/>simulations and key observations used. Section 3 <lb/>describes the biases in CMIP5 reports compared to <lb/>observations and results from sensitivity experiments. <lb/>Conclusions and a discussion of major findings are <lb/>provided in section 4. <lb/>2. Model and data description <lb/>2.1. Model and sensitivity experiment <lb/>The National Center for Atmospheric Research-<lb/>Department of Energy (NCAR-DOE) CESM1 is a <lb/>coupled climate model for simulating the Earth&apos;s <lb/>climate system (for details see section 2 in Li et al <lb/>(2015)). The descriptions and performance of the <lb/>cloud-related physical parameterizations in its atmos-<lb/>phere component, CAM5, can be found in Morrison <lb/>and Gettelman (2008), Gettelman et al (2010), and <lb/>Lindvall et al (2013). <lb/>In this study, numerical experiments were per-<lb/>formed with the diagnostic falling ice radiative effects <lb/>turned off (hereafter, NoS) and on (hereafter, S). The <lb/>changes of model fields due to the inclusion of falling <lb/>ice radiative effects are calculated as the difference <lb/>between the simulation without and with these effects, <lb/>which is referred to as &apos;NoS-S.&apos; Both simulations are <lb/>set up in the same manner as used in CMIP5. The spe-<lb/>cific scenario used in these sensitivity experiments is <lb/>the CMIP5 historical runs (1850-2005) with exactly <lb/>the same model components used in the CESM1 <lb/>contribution to CMIP5, where the same initial fields <lb/>from preindustrial and the observed 20th century <lb/>greenhouse gas, ozone, aerosol, and solar forcing are <lb/>used (Taylor et al 2012). The simulation time period <lb/>used in the analyses presented here is 1970-2005. <lb/>2.2. Satellite AOD data <lb/>In this study, AOD observations from MISR and MODIS <lb/>are utilized. MISR was launched in December 1999 <lb/>onboard Terra, NASA&apos;s flagship Earth Observing System <lb/>(EOS) spacecraft. MISR consists of nine cameras that <lb/>view the Earth simultaneously at different angles (nadir <lb/>and 26.1°, 45.6°, 60.0°, and 70.5°forward and backward <lb/>of nadir) and observes each scene over an interval of <lb/>7 min with a common swath of approximately 400 km <lb/>(Diner et al 1998). Global coverage is achieved every nine <lb/>days. MISR&apos;s standard, operational data products are <lb/>available and listed in the following link: http://eosweb. <lb/>larc.nasa.gov/project/misr/misr_table. <lb/>MODIS aboard NASA&apos;s Terra satellite, has 36 <lb/>spectral bands with wavelengths from 0.41 to 14 μm <lb/>and its 2330 km wide swath provides global coverage <lb/>every two days. Both MODIS and MISR have been <lb/>widely used for monitoring aerosol properties and <lb/>both provide long time series of global aerosol abun-<lb/>dances and properties. In this study, we utilize Level 3 <lb/>monthly gridded data from MISR Version 22 and <lb/>MODIS Collection 6.1 Dark Target (DT) to compare <lb/>with model results. <lb/>Figure 1 shows the annual mean AOD distribution <lb/>over the global ocean from these satellite observations <lb/>based on the time period from 2001 through 2005. <lb/>The spatial pattern and magnitudes are similar <lb/>between the MISR and MODIS annual AODs <lb/>(figures 1(a) and (b)), with a mean AOD difference of <lb/>about 0.01 over global ocean (figure 1(c)). Based on <lb/>Kahn et al (2009), the MISR-MODIS correlation coef-<lb/>ficient is about 0.9 over ocean. <lb/>For ocean, the MODIS Collection 6.1 DT AODs <lb/>agree well with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERO-<lb/>NET) AODs (correlation coefficient = 0.880, and <lb/>root-mean-square error = 0.083) with 73.5% of the <lb/>data samples falling within the expected errors (as <lb/>shown in figure 3(a) in Wei et al 2019). The uncer-<lb/>tainty of MODIS AOD is ±(0.03+5% × AOD) over <lb/>ocean (Remer et al 2005, Wei et al 2019). As for MISR, <lb/>about 70%-75% of MISR-retrieved AOD values falls <lb/>within the greater of 0.05 or 20%×AOD of AERO-<lb/>NET (Kahn et al 2010). The correlation coefficients <lb/>between MISR AOD and AERONET are ∼0.9 for mar-<lb/>itime stations (Kahn et al 2010). In the version of the <lb/>product used here, the retrieval of MISR AOD over <lb/>water may be subject to several known issues, includ-<lb/>ing cloud contamination of retrieved AOD, camera <lb/>artifacts in high-contrast scenes, residual calibration <lb/>effects, etc (e.g. Witek et al 2018a, 2018b). Despite dif-<lb/>ferent sources of uncertainty from the two satellite <lb/>retrievals, these data sets are the best available in terms <lb/>of their long term records and global coverage, and <lb/>figure 1(c) provides confidence that their performance <lb/>is similar over global oceans. For model and observa-<lb/>tions comparisons, we use the long-term annual mean <lb/>AOD output from 10 CMIP5 CGCM historical runs <lb/>(1970-2005) with the mean annual AOD retrieved <lb/>from MISR and MODIS (2001-2005) (see figure 2). <lb/>3. Model results <lb/>3.1. CMIP5 model AOD bias <lb/>Figures 2(a)-(j) show the biases of long-term mean <lb/>(1970-2005) spatial distribution of AOD in the Pacific <lb/>from 10 CMIP5 CGCMs (see table 1) as compared with <lb/>satellite observations, shown in figure 2(k) for reference. <lb/>For six of the models, the simulated annual mean AOD <lb/>is underestimated relative to mean satellite AOD, while <lb/>four of the models (figures 2(a)-(d)) show relatively <lb/>good agreement. For the three models in which falling <lb/>ice radiative effects are considered (figures 2(a)-(c)), the <lb/>AOD bias is relatively small over the tropical Pacific <lb/>with a mean of −0.002 (figure 3(a)). In comparison, the <lb/>AOD over the tropical Pacific is significantly under-<lb/>estimated by those models that do not consider falling <lb/>ice radiative effects (figures 2(e)-(j)), which overall have <lb/>a mean bias of −0.047 (figure 3(b)). <lb/></body>

			<body>impacts of falling ice radiative effects on the SSA bias. <lb/>Based on the parameterization of SSA generation in <lb/>CESM1 represented in equation (1), the sensitivities of <lb/>wind speed, SST, and precipitation to the falling ice <lb/>radiative effects are examined over Pacific trade-wind <lb/>regions, in particular. <lb/>Figure 4 shows the 925 hPa wind differences for <lb/>1970-2005 for the NoS-S scenarios from our CESM1-<lb/>CAM5 simulations. The V-shaped marking in figure 4 <lb/>highlights a region where an anomalous southeast <lb/>low-level outflow is clearly found over the northern <lb/>warm pool and southern Pacific trade wind regions in <lb/>the annual mean state (figure 4(a)). The smallest wind <lb/>speed differences between the NoS and S scenarios are <lb/>observed in the boreal summer months (JJA, <lb/>figure 4(b)) while the largest wind speed differences <lb/>are observed in boreal winter (DJF, figure 4(c)). These <lb/>patterns are also common in the CMIP5 models that <lb/>lack falling ice-radiation effects (see SI). <lb/>The differences in annual means of AOD, 10 m <lb/>wind speed, precipitation, and SST between NoS and S <lb/>(NoS-S) for the Pacific basin are shown in figure 5. The <lb/>AOD difference between NoS and S simulations <lb/>(figure 5(a)) is more apparent from the Western Pacific <lb/>warm pool to the north of the SPCZ, with lower AOD in <lb/>NoS simulations (those not including falling ice-radia-<lb/>tion interactions). In the NoS case, relative to the S case, <lb/>there are weaker easterly trade winds (figure 5(b)) <lb/>caused by low-level outflow, resulting in weaker upper <lb/>ocean mixing along with excessive precipitation <lb/>(figure 5(c)), and warmer SST (Ts; shown in figure 5(d)) <lb/>over the tropical Pacific with underestimated AOD. <lb/>This demonstrates there are systematic biases in the <lb/>coupling of the precipitation-radiation-circulation <lb/>caused by the lack of falling ice radiative effects simu-<lb/>lated in CESM1. Through changes in wind, precipita-<lb/>tion, and SST, the abundance of SSA is altered via <lb/>dynamical air-sea coupling processes. <lb/>Figure 3.

			<body>The correlation in the Pacific between the difference <lb/>in AOD and the change in each dependent parameter <lb/>was examined. The AOD difference between NoS and S <lb/>is highly correlated with the difference in wind speed <lb/>(figure 6(a)), with a domain-averaged spatial correlation <lb/>coefficient of 0.64. This is not surprising, as the source of <lb/>SSA depends on wind speed to the power of 3.41, as <lb/>shown in equation (1). On the other hand, excessive pre-<lb/>cipitation leads to a negative correlation between the <lb/>change in precipitation and the change in AOD from the <lb/>NoS and S simulations, with a domain-averaged correla-<lb/>tion coefficient of −0.40 (figure 6(b)). For AOD and SST, <lb/>the correlation coefficient is −0.32 (figure 6(c)), which <lb/>indicates a somewhat weaker relationship compared to <lb/>AOD-wind speed and AOD-precipitation. The relation-<lb/>ship between AOD and SST is dependent on the size of <lb/>the aerosol particles according to laboratory experiments <lb/>carried out by Martensson et al (2003). For aerosols with <lb/>dry diameters &lt;0.07 μm (&gt;0.35 μm), the number con-<lb/>centration decreases (increases) with increasing (decreas-<lb/>ing) water temperature. For the size range from 0.07 to <lb/>0.35 μm, there is no clear temperature dependence of the <lb/>aerosol concentrations. The correlations between AOD <lb/>difference and precipitation/SST difference (−0.4 and <lb/>−0.32) are not robust enough, which might be due to the <lb/>offset contributions from the 10m wind speed (positive <lb/>contribution) and precipitation/SSTs (negative contrib-<lb/>ution) to the net AOD changes. <lb/>Figure 7 shows the improvement from NoS to S <lb/>against the annual mean AOD from MISR and <lb/>MODIS observations. The satellite data are from 2001 <lb/>to 2005, corresponding to the period of overlap <lb/>between model simulations and observations. As <lb/>shown in figure 2(a), comparing the CESM1 simula-<lb/>tions with MISR and MODIS, the simulated AODs are <lb/>underestimated in the western central Pacific Ocean <lb/>near the equator and in the northwest Pacific Ocean. <lb/>In order to determine whether the inclusion of falling <lb/>ice radiation interactions can decrease the biases <lb/>between the model and the observations, the absolute <lb/>improvement from NoS to S run compared to obser-<lb/>vations is calculated as: <lb/>⎛ <lb/>⎝ <lb/>⎜ <lb/>⎞ <lb/>⎠ <lb/>⎟ <lb/>( ) <lb/>( ) <lb/>= <lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>-<lb/>Ábsolute <lb/>improvement <lb/>AOD <lb/>AOD <lb/>AOD <lb/>AOD <lb/>AOD <lb/>AOD <lb/>% <lb/>100%. <lb/>2 <lb/>NoS <lb/>satellite <lb/>satellite <lb/>S <lb/>satellite <lb/>satellite <lb/>Positive values indicate improvement from NoS to S. <lb/>In figure 7(a), regions with positive values (reddish <lb/>Figure 4.

			<body>4. Conclusion and discussion <lb/>Oceanic aerosols are important for supplying cloud <lb/>condensation nuclei, and affect Earth&apos;s climate energy <lb/>and water budget through their coupling to clouds via <lb/>the indirect and semi-direct effects. In GCMs, the <lb/>representation of SSA is dependent upon modeled <lb/>near-surface wind speed, SST, and precipitation. <lb/>However, most GCMs do not consider falling ice <lb/>radiative effects, resulting in too-warm SSTs, weaker <lb/>surface winds and excessive precipitation over the <lb/>Pacific trade-wind regions. To explore whether these <lb/>effects might lead to underestimated SSA, we exam-<lb/>ined the impacts of falling ice radiative effects on <lb/>modeled SSA using CESM1-CAM5 by turning on and <lb/>off falling ice radiative effects (S and NoS). We found <lb/>that when neglecting the falling ice radiative effects in <lb/>CESM1, the model produces weaker low-level winds, <lb/>excessive precipitation, and warmer SST, leading to <lb/>underestimated SSA through precipitation-cloud-cir-<lb/>culation coupling. The above mentioned biases are <lb/>commonly found in most CMIP5 models. The geo-<lb/>graphic distribution and the values of the SSA bias are <lb/>found to be mainly controlled by the modeled biases in <lb/>precipitation and surface wind speeds. With the <lb/>inclusion of falling ice radiation effects in CESM1, the <lb/>SSA absolute biases decrease by ∼10% to 15% in the <lb/>central Pacific Ocean. <lb/>We conclude that the exclusion of falling ice radia-<lb/>tive effects in most GCMs partially contributes to the <lb/>modeled AOD biases. We found that in most CMIP5 <lb/>models the differences between the NoS and S scenar-<lb/>ios correspond to anomalously weaker outflow in the <lb/>western Pacific warm pool and southern Pacific trade <lb/>wind regions, which reduces upper ocean mixing and <lb/>ultimately increases SST and precipitation and decrea-<lb/>ses sea surface salinity. It is suggested that one cause of <lb/>bias between modeled SSA and satellite data is the <lb/>missing representation of the falling ice radiative <lb/>effects in the models. As indicated schematically in <lb/>figure 8, the local SSA can be affected by local and non-<lb/>local air-sea coupling. The SSA bias could be reduced <lb/>by improving the model-simulated near surface <lb/>winds, SST, and precipitation. For GCMs including <lb/>the falling ice radiative effects, the SSA biases have <lb/>decreased, as shown in CESM1-CAM5 and two Had-<lb/>GEM2 models in CMIP5. We found that the bias in <lb/>the simulating SSA radiative effects can therefore be <lb/>influenced by the biases either locally or remotely <lb/>determined by other parameters, in this case, pre-<lb/>cipitation, surface winds, and SSTs through air-sea <lb/>coupling. We suggest that when dealing with aerosol <lb/>biases in model, other than tuning the emissions, con-<lb/>sideration of the dynamical processes affecting aerosol <lb/>abundance is also essential. <lb/>Figure 7.
