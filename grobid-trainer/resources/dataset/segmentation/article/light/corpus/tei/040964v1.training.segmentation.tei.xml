			<front>Summary <lb/>How are public goods 1-4 maintained in bacterial cooperative populations? The presence of <lb/>these compounds is usually threatened by the rise of cheaters that do not contribute but <lb/>just exploit the common resource 5,6 . Minimizing cheater invasions appears then as a <lb/>necessary maintenance mechanism 7,8 . However, that invasions can instead add to the <lb/>persistence of cooperation is a prospect that has yet remained largely unexplored 6 . Here, <lb/>we show that the detrimental consequences of cheaters can actually preserve public goods, <lb/>at the cost of recurrent collapses and revivals of the population. The result is made <lb/>possible by the interplay between spatial constraints and the essentiality of the shared <lb/>resource. We validate this counter-intuitive effect by carefully combining theory and <lb/>experiment, with the engineering of an explicit synthetic community in which the public <lb/>compound allows survival to a bactericidal stress. Notably, the characterization of the <lb/>experimental system identifies additional factors that can matter, like the impact of the lag <lb/>phase on the tolerance to stress, or the appearance of spontaneous mutants. Our work <lb/>emphasizes the unanticipated consequences of the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that emerge <lb/>in microbial communities relying on essential public goods to function, feedbacks that <lb/>reveal fundamental for the adaptive change of ecosystems at all scales. <lb/></front>

			<body>Main text <lb/>The threat of cheaters represents at a microbial scale a well-known public good <lb/>(PG) dilemma, known as the &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; 9 , and can fundamentally interfere <lb/>with the sustainability of microbial communities. The necessity of recognizing the <lb/>consequences of social dilemmas in microorganisms thus becomes essential, given their <lb/>impact in many aspects of life on Earth, and also its particular relevance to humans in <lb/>matters of health (microbiome) 10 , and industry (bioremediation, biofuels, etc) 11 . We <lb/>considered specifically a scenario in which a community is organized as a dynamical <lb/>metapopulation (i.e., the community is transiently separated into groups) 12 , and the action <lb/>of a PG is essential for its survival. Spatial structure is a well-known universal mechanism <lb/>to promote cooperation 13 , which frequently emerges in bacterial populations, for instance, <lb/>due to the restricted range of microbial interactions 14,15 . However, it is much less <lb/>understood how the presence of structure affects the maintenance of cooperation when <lb/>combined with explicit population dynamics (earlier work usually assumed constant <lb/>population and only examined evolutionary dynamics) 16 . The change in population size <lb/>associated to the essentiality of the PG can indeed bring about complex eco-evolutionary <lb/>feedbacks 17-20 , in which both population density and frequency of &quot;cooperators&quot; influence <lb/>each other. The connection between these feedbacks and spatial structure remains thus an <lb/>open problem that has started to be addressed only recently 21-22 . We show in this work <lb/>how such connection can direct to the unforeseen consequence that cheater invasions <lb/>eventually support cooperation. <lb/>To analyze this scenario, we first introduced a stylized in silico model considering <lb/>an initial finite population of agents -representing bacteria-with a given frequency of <lb/>cooperators (producers of a PG, with a fitness cost) and cheaters (nonproducers, that <lb/>could have emerged originally from the cooperators by mutation)(Methods). The <lb/>population is temporarily organized in groups, where interactions take place (fig. S1). <lb/>These interactions are modelled by means of a PG game with individual reproduction <lb/>being set by the game payoff 17,18 . Figure 1A displays a representative trajectory of the <lb/>model: an increase of the cheating strain, due to its fitness advantage, causes a decrease in <lb/></body>

			<body>population density (less PG available). The demographic fall originates in the end <lb/>variation in the composition of the groups, facilitating population assortment and the <lb/>appearance of pure cooperator/cheater groups. Since the groups uniquely constituted by <lb/>cooperators grow larger, they can ultimately reactivate the global population promoting <lb/>again new cheater invasions. The whole process manifests in this way as a continuous <lb/>cycle of decay and recovery of the community (Figs. 1A-B) (Methods). Demographic <lb/>collapses consequently turn into an endogenous ecological mechanism that causes the <lb/>required intergroup diversity, supporting the overall increase of cooperators by means of a <lb/>statistical phenomenon known as Simpson&apos;s paradox 12,22 . To underline that an endogenous <lb/>ecological process naturally induces the variance that finally rescues cooperation, we <lb/>introduced the notion of &quot;ecological Simpson&apos;s paradox&quot;. <lb/>We then tested these ideas experimentally, by engineering a synthetic PG <lb/>interaction that is essential for the survival of a microbial population to a bactericidal <lb/>antibiotic (Fig. 1C). Specifically, we constructed an experimental system in which a <lb/>synthetic Escherichia coli strain (the cooperator/producer) constitutively secretes an <lb/>autoinducer molecule acting as PG. This molecule is part of a quorum-sensing (QS) <lb/>system foreign to E. coli, which includes a cognate transcriptional regulator. We <lb/>connected this machinery to the expression of a gene that enables the synthetic strain to <lb/>tolerate the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (gm) (fig. S2, the system is a variation of an <lb/>earlier one 22 )(Methods). A second strain (the cheater/nonproducer) that only utilizes the <lb/>PG can also be part of the community (we labelled the cooperative and cheater strains <lb/>with a green and red fluorescent protein, respectively, to make possible population <lb/>measures) (Methods). Two crucial aspects distinguish in this way the designed setup. <lb/>First, the presence of PG becomes an essential requirement to tolerate stress (Fig. 1D) <lb/>(fig. S3). Second, the system exhibits an intrinsic vulnerability, as cheaters could <lb/>overtake the entire community since they evade the cost of producing the PG (Fig. 1E) <lb/>(fig. S4). While in this case the presence of cheaters is part of the synthetic design, their <lb/>emergence as result of mutations is well documented in natural settings 5,6 . <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>The validation of the presented ecological Simpson&apos;s paradox is done using a <lb/>minimal experimental protocol integrating the most important features of the model: the <lb/>demographic collapse induced by cheaters, and the subsequent recovery of cooperation <lb/>supported by the spatial constraints, i.e., the metapopulation. Specifically, the protocol <lb/>includes two growing periods of PG accumulation and later exposure to stress (gm). <lb/>Densities of cooperators and cheaters are quantified by plating (Methods). Both the in <lb/>silico model and the main attributes of the experimental system predict that a community <lb/>with different frequency of cooperative and noncooperative strains would accumulate a <lb/>distinct amount of PG, and thus present different tolerance to stress. To confirm this, we <lb/>engineered an initial population with density ~10 4 cells/ml and different composition (fig. <lb/>S5)(Methods). Figure 2A confirms the differential tolerance to stress (inset illustrates the <lb/>resultant range of accumulation of QS molecules), whereas Fig. 2B additionally shows the <lb/>effect on tolerance of rising the strength of stress for a fixed composition (20% <lb/>cooperators). Note that the fraction of producers in these final populations does not vary <lb/>substantially (fig S6). <lb/>Next, by distributing the initial full population into a metapopulation structure -<lb/>before the rounds of QS accumulation and stress-we showed experimentally the basic <lb/>features of the ecological Simpson&apos;s paradox. In particular, we selected as initial <lb/>conditions the ones obtained after a large mixed population experienced a first round of <lb/>comparatively strong stress (Fig. 2B, outcomes of an earlier round with a initial density of <lb/>~ 10 4 cells/ml constituted by 20% producers). As in the model, the reduced accumulation <lb/>of PG in the mixed population causes a demographic collapse, which depends on how <lb/>essential the PG becomes (the strength of stress). We considered explicitly the resulting <lb/>populations after experiencing a medium (9.5µg/ml) and strong (13µg/ml) gm stress. <lb/>These corresponded on average to ~24cfu/ml, and ~8cfu/ml, respectively (in what <lb/>follows, we labelled them as &quot;pop 1&quot; and &quot;pop 2&quot;; the frequency of cooperators remains <lb/>~20%). When we subsequently implemented a second round of the protocol with these <lb/>initial population conditions, and the corresponding (medium and strong) gm dosages, we <lb/>obtained two drastically different initial metapopulation distributions (Fig. 2C) (fig. S7). <lb/>Notably, a low-density population (&quot;pop 2&quot;) generates groups with very few cells and <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>assortment of cooperators, which is the group class that best tolerate stress (the <lb/>characteristic behavior of this class is shown in Fig. 2D). Moreover, mixed groups and <lb/>those composed by only cheaters do not grow, on average, with strong gm dosage (Fig. <lb/>2D) (fig. S8). In this way, when all the groups of the metapopulation are pooled together, <lb/>cooperators typically increase in frequency and population density recovers, in what is a <lb/>manifestation of the ecological Simpson&apos;s paradox previously described (fig. S8) <lb/>(Methods). Hence, the demographic decay of the population caused by the invasion of <lb/>cheaters reveals crucial to attain the necessary heterogeneity among the various groups, <lb/>and allows the recovery of cooperation. For a large population, groups exhibit a similar <lb/>composition, on average, and as a result the behavior in the occurrence of the <lb/>metapopulation is the same as in the absence of any structure, i.e., every well is in effect a <lb/>replica of the same condition. <lb/>Two additional constraints could modify the dynamics above, which associate to <lb/>general aspects of resistance and tolerance to antibiotic stress 23 . The first one identifies a <lb/>possible trade-off between the build up of PG and the lag time of bacteria before exposure <lb/>to the antibiotic. As Fig. 2A illustrated, the more PG a population accumulates (i.e., the <lb/>longer it grows), the more it tolerates stress. However, when extensive growth implies a <lb/>deterioration of the environmental conditions, PG could lose its functional activity 24 (Fig. <lb/>3A)(fig. S9). Growing too much could be problematic. Moreover, when a bacterial <lb/>population stays some time in saturating conditions, it presents a longer lag phase that <lb/>indirectly protects bacteria from antibiotics 23 , independently on whether PG is available or <lb/>not (Fig. 3A). Within the previous context of the recovery due to the ecological <lb/>Simpson&apos;s paradox (Fig. 2C-D), low initial densities assure a regime further from <lb/>saturation at the end of the accumulation period. This implies less decay of the PG and <lb/>shorter lag, i.e., revival is under these conditions mostly linked to the action of the PG. <lb/>The second constraint relates to the spontaneous emergence of mutants, which can resist <lb/>the antibiotic and thus enable recovery of cheater populations in the absence of PG. This <lb/>type of rescue is more difficult as the antibiotic dosage is increased, e.g., 25 (fig. S10), and <lb/>also underlines a constraint on the accumulation time of PG (the longer this period, the <lb/>bigger the population and the chance for a mutant to arise) (Fig. 3B-C). Of note, both of <lb/>these restrictions are less significant when the collapse of the population is very strong <lb/></body>

			<body>(&quot;pop 2&quot; situation), that is when the best conditions exist for the ecological Simpson&apos;s <lb/>paradox. <lb/>This study emphasizes that the combination of spatial constraints and specific <lb/>attributes of the PG (e.g., essentiality) can be crucial for the outcome of the eco-<lb/>evolutionary dynamics in cooperative bacterial communities. This is important in <lb/>circumstances where the PG aids tolerance to stress, when nonintuitive effects may <lb/>appear: an increase in cheaters frequency, or AB dosage, can actually precede the <lb/>recovery of cooperation in the population. The particular experimental setup also provides <lb/>synthetic strains with essential public goods; an original tool to test the demographic risks <lb/>of cheaters invasions and implement experimentally a microbial tragedy of commons 9 , <lb/>where cooperation is tied to population survival. Our results show overall that in this <lb/>framework, spatial constraints, growth phase and the emergence of noninteracting mutant <lb/>clones are aspects that should be considered to fully appreciate the resilience of social <lb/>interactions in bacterial populations. In addition, synthetic communities emerge as <lb/>tractable experimental models in which to begin to understand the tight ecological and <lb/>evolutionary feedbacks increasingly observed in ecosystems worldwide 26 . <lb/></body>

(A) <lb/>Typical population dynamics obtained with an in silico model of a microbial community, <lb/>which is organized as a transient metapopulation (fig. S1) (Methods). Growth depends on <lb/>an essential public good (PG) produced by the &quot;cooperator&quot; individuals. When &quot;cheaters&quot; <lb/>invade, the decline in the amount of PG drives the collapse of the total population. This <lb/>collapse paradoxically determines its subsequent revival. (B) Revival is coupled to the <lb/>endogenous emergence of variability in the composition of the groups (constituting the <lb/>metapopulation) when the population is falling 17,18 , and the following occurence of groups <lb/>only constituted by cooperators (ecological Simpson&apos;s paradox). For the time window <lb/>highlighted in (A), we display group composition (bottom; ratio of cooperators on each <lb/>group is colored according to the gradient shown; white squares denote empty groups, of <lb/>a total of N=30), intergroup diversity (top; black curve, quantified as variance in group <lb/>composition), and number of empty groups (top; pink curve). (C) To test experimentally <lb/>these ideas, we engineered synthetic strains that contribute (green), or not (red), to the <lb/>production of quorum-sensing (QS) molecules acting as an essential PG (fig. S2). A cell <lb/>community that accumulates (top) or obtains (bottom) the PG in the environment is able <lb/>to tolerate a bactericidal antibiotic stress (gentamicin, gm), although the latter can survive <lb/>least because the initial PG is spent. Moreover, a community growing without PG would <lb/>eventually collapse (middle). (D) Survival to gm of a population constituted only by <lb/>cheaters increases when the essential QS molecules are added to the preincubation <lb/>medium, before growing under the stress (8µg/ml gm, N=17 replicas per QS dosage, solid <lb/>color represent 95% confidence interval of a local polynomial regression). (E) Fraction of <lb/>cooperators in a mixed population decays with time due to the invasion of cheaters, which <lb/>do not pay the cost of making the PG (fig. S4). This is independent of the initial fraction <lb/>(10% or 50% of cooperators). Boxes indicate standard deviation linked to the <lb/>experimental estimation of ratios. See (Methods) for further details and protocols. <lb/>Fig. 2. Experimental test of the ecological Simpson&apos;s paradox.

Initial conditions correspond to those of either <lb/>&quot;pop 1&quot; or &quot;pop2&quot; in (B). Each population is first distributed in a multiwell plate <lb/>representing a metapopulation, followed by a period of accumulation of QS (T 1 ) and <lb/>stress (T 2 ), as before (low initial densities on each well are represented here by weak <lb/>opacity). The population is then quantified by plating and considered as a whole (merged <lb/>metapopulation). Note the enrichment of groups of nPs for the &quot;pop 2&quot; experimental <lb/>condition, and also the appearance of some groups constituted by only Ps. (D) Groups of <lb/>Ps tolerate better the stress than groups of nPs, and lead to the recovery of the <lb/>cooperation. We quantified the characteristic tolerance by engineering replica populations <lb/>of only Ps and only nPs with the &quot;pop 1&quot; and &quot;pop 2&quot; associated cell densities and gm <lb/>dosages, and then measured recovery of each well (each dot represents the fate of a <lb/>replica well, N=45). A maximal value of ~10000 cfu/well denotes very strong recovery. <lb/>Mixed wells with low initial density normally exhibit the fate of nPs at these high dosages <lb/>(fig. S8). Note that nPs show almost no recovery in the &quot;pop 2&quot; conditions (bottom, gm = <lb/>13µg/ml). See also main text. <lb/>Fig. 3.

Starting from these &quot;pop 2&quot; initial densities, and after an accumulation time of <lb/>15.5 hrs (T 1 ), cells are in exponential phase, and the amount of QS is maximal. Recovery <lb/>is thus strongly linked to the presence of the public good (PG). (B-C) Emergence of <lb/>spontaneous mutants to gm.

We repeated the experiment for each strain and dosage, so that one <lb/>can quantify the typical resulting population, and also the mutant subpopulation (by <lb/>plating with -gm-and without -no gm-antibiotic; the specific plating dosage corresponds <lb/>to that of the matching growing conditions). Emergence of spontaneous mutants is <lb/>reduced at higher dosage (C). Tolerance is most significantly associated in this regime to <lb/>the presence of the PG. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>Ecological public good model <lb/>We used a model first described in 21 to simulate the dynamics of a population whose <lb/>growth is based on an essential public good (PG). It is based on a one-shot PG game 27 <lb/>in which agents can contribute (&quot;cooperators&quot;) or not (&quot;cheaters&quot;) to the PG in <lb/>groups of size N. Contributing implies a cost c to the agents. Group contributions are <lb/>then summed, multiplied by a reward factor r (that determines the efficiency of the <lb/>investments and the attractiveness of the PG) and redistributed to all group <lb/>members, irrespectively of their contribution. The PG game is characterized by the <lb/>parameters N, r and c (group size, efficiency and cost of the PG, respectively, where <lb/>we fixed c = 1 without loss of generality). <lb/>Every simulation starts with an initial population constituted by a common pool of k <lb/>identical agents in the cooperator state, where k is the maximal population size <lb/>(carrying capacity), to be updated in a sequential way as follows (see also Figure S1): <lb/>(i) The common pool is divided in randomly formed groups of size N (i.e. N is the <lb/>total number of individuals and empty spaces in each group). The number of formed <lb/>groups is then ⌊k/N⌋. <lb/>(ii) In each one of the (non-empty) groups, a one-shot PG game is played. This means <lb/>that cheaters receive the payoff Pcheater = icr/(i + j), while cooperators receive the <lb/>same payoff minus a cost, i.e. Pcooperator = Pcheater − c; with i,j being the number of <lb/>cooperators and cheaters in the group, respectively, and i + j ≤ N. After the <lb/>interaction the grouping of individuals is dissolved. <lb/>(iii) Each individual can replicate (duplicate) with a probability that is calculated by <lb/>dividing its payoff by the maximal possible one (i.e. the payoff obtained by a cheater <lb/>in a group of N−1 producers). Each cooperator that replicates generates an offspring <lb/>that is either a cheater (with probability ν) or an identical cooperator (with <lb/>probability 1−ν). <lb/>(iv) Individuals are removed with probability δ (individual death rate). <lb/>In simpler words, the life cycle of the computational model is characterized by two <lb/>distinct stages. In stage I (steps i-ii), the population is structured in evenly sized <lb/>randomly formed groups in which the PG game is played. In stage II (steps iii-iv, <lb/>after groups disappear), each individual replicates according to the group <lb/>composition (and payoff) experienced in stage I. Replication can happen only when <lb/>the current total population is less than the maximal population size, k, i.e. there <lb/>exits empty space (empty spaces are calculated by considering k minus the current <lb/>amount of individuals in the population). If more individuals could replicate than the <lb/>available empty space, only a random subset of them ultimately replicates (of size <lb/>the number of empty spaces available). <lb/>Media, growth conditions and chemicals <lb/>Strains were grown in LB broth (10gl -1 casein peptone, 5gl -1 yeast extract, and 5gl -1 <lb/>NaCl) at 30 o C with constant shaking. Overnight cultures were grown aerobically in <lb/></body>

			<body>flasks (170rpm) at 30 o C, and experiments were performed in 96-well plates <lb/>(Thermo Scientific, Denmark), with 200µl of medium, 50µl of mineral oil (Sigma-<lb/>Aldrich, MO, USA), and shaking at 10000rpm and 30 o C. Where indicated, antibiotics <lb/>were added to the liquid medium or plate at final concentrations: kanamycin (Km) <lb/>50μg/ml, spectinomycin (Sp) 50μg/ml in the construction of strains and 25μg/ml in <lb/>experiments, and/or gentamicin (gm) with concentration as noted in the <lb/>experiments. The synthetic quorum-sensing molecule N-butyryl-L-homoserine <lb/>lactone (C4-HSL) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Mi, USA). Cell dilutions <lb/>were done in PBS (pH 7.4, 80.6mM Na2HPO4, 19.4mM KH2PO4, 27mM KCl, 1.37M <lb/>NaCl at 10X, USB Corporation, OH, USA). <lb/>Measurement of population size <lb/>Cultures were spread onto 1.5% (w/v) agar plates with five 3mm glass beads for <lb/>30s, and are incubated at 30 o C for 48h (or otherwise indicated). Then, to quantify the <lb/>cell number of a population we counted colony forming units (CFU) under blue light <lb/>illumination (LED transilluminator, Safe Imager™ 2.0, Invitrogen, Waltham MA USA). <lb/>The OD600 of cultures was measured in a VICTOR2x 2030 Multilabel Reader machine <lb/>(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) with intermittent orbital shaking. For <lb/>experiments with P and nP strains, Km and Sp were added to the media. <lb/>General DNA techniques, plasmids and strain constructions <lb/>The different E. coli strains were derivatives of JC1080 (BW25113 ∆sdi::FRT) 22 . <lb/>Oligonucleotides used in this work are indicated in Table S1. Plasmid DNA was <lb/>prepared using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). When <lb/>required DNA was purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, <lb/>Germany). Colony PCR was performed by transferring cells directly from fresh agar <lb/>plates into PCR reaction tubes. <lb/>The pZS4int-rhIL-GmLAA plasmid was constructed by PCR amplifying the aacC1 <lb/>gene (Gm R ), from pSEVA611 plasmid 28 , to which 33-bp, encoding the <lb/>AANDENYALAA protease degradation tag was added to the 3´-end using primers <lb/>Gm-kpnI-F and GmLAA-hindIII-R (Table S1). The ∼0.5-kb PCR DNA was digested <lb/>with KpnI and HindIII and used to replace the ∼0.7-kb fragment containing the <lb/>catLVA resistance marker from pZS4int-rhl-catLVA 22 generating the pZS4int-rhIL-<lb/>GmLAA plasmid. Thus, the &quot;Genomic insert&quot; parental strain was constructed by <lb/>integrating the cassette T0-Sp R -rhlR←PlacIq-Prhl→Gm R <lb/>LAA-T1 into the λ attachment site <lb/>(attB) of E. coli JC1080 with the helper plasmid pLDR8, that bears the lambda <lb/>integrase, as described 29 . The pZS4int-rhIL-GFP plasmid was assembled by <lb/>extracting the gfp gene from pSEVA241-Prhl→gfp vector (lab collection) upon <lb/>digestion with KpnI and HindIII. Then, the 0.7-kb DNA fragment was cloned into the <lb/>KpnI and HindIII sites of pZS4int-rhIL-GmLAA replacing the Gm R <lb/>LAA cassette for a <lb/>GFP fluorescent reporter. <lb/>Then, the quorum sensing reporter &quot;biosensor&quot; strain was constructed by <lb/>introducing into the λ attachment site (attB) of E. coli JC1080 the cassette T0-Sp R -<lb/>rhlR←PlacIq-Prhl→gfp-T1 as described above. The plasmid pZS*2R-GFP-rhlI (ori-<lb/>SC101*, PR→gfp-rhlI, Km R ) was obtained from 22 . The pZS*2R-mCherry (ori-SC101*, <lb/>PR→gfp-rhlI, Km R ) plasmid was constructed by amplifying mcherry from pSEVA237R <lb/></body>

We <lb/>grew the &quot;biosensor&quot; strain overnight, adjusted the OD600 to 0.1 and grew aerobically <lb/>for 2.5h at 30 o C. Then, the culture was aliquoted and purified supernatant from the <lb/>experimental sample was added. We used known concentrations (0, 0.1μM, 1μM, <lb/>10μM, and 100μM) of the commercial N-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) to <lb/>obtain a calibration curve. We grew these preparations aerobically for 3h, laid out <lb/>200 μl of cultures in quadruplicates in a 96-well black/clear bottom microtiter plate <lb/>(Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and measured OD600 and GFP fluorescence (ex: 488nm; <lb/>em: 520nm; cutoff: 495nm) in a SpectraMax M2 e microplate reader (Molecular <lb/>Devices, CA, USA). Supernatants were obtained from 200μl of overnight liquid <lb/>cultures prepared following the &quot;Accumulation of PG and stress&quot; protocol, <lb/>centrifuged twice at room temperature to remove cells and used directly to induce <lb/>growing cells of the reporter strain. Comparing observed supernatant fluorescence <lb/>to the calibration curve approximated QS molecule quantities. <lb/>Engineering of initial conditions <lb/>Initial populations for the &quot;accumulation of PG and stress&quot; protocol and others were <lb/>prepared by mixing cooperators and cheaters at a defined population density (10⁴ <lb/>cells/well for high initial density experiments and 1-10 cell/well for low initial <lb/>density experiments) and cooperator frequency. Overnight cultures of producers <lb/>and nonproducers were washed twice with PBS by centrifugation for 15min at <lb/>3800rpm and room temperature. Then, OD600 was adjusted to 0.15. We assembled <lb/>populations at the desired P frequency in a fixed final volume (2.5ml), which was <lb/>then serially diluted to the required cell density. This dilution was done in large <lb/>volumes of medium (20ml) and applying low dilution factor (¼) each step to <lb/>minimize the introduction of error in strain frequencies. Initial dilution steps were <lb/>performed in PBS and the final 3 steps were performed in LB with Km, Sp. The <lb/>robustness of this procedure is shown in Fig. S5. <lb/>Invasion of nonproducers <lb/>We prepared washed cultures of producers and nonproducers as described above. <lb/>After adjusting OD600, to 0.15 we mixed both strains at the indicated frequency. Then, <lb/>we inoculated three replica 50ml Erlenmeyer flasks with 5ml of LB, Km, Sp. After <lb/>24h, we reseeded a new flask with a 1/100 dilution and fresh medium. In order to <lb/>estimate producer frequency in grown cultures, cells were 1/10 serially diluted in <lb/>PBS using a total of 10ml of medium, plated onto LB agar plates, and colonies <lb/>counted after 24h at 30 o C. We followed this process for 4 consecutive days. <lb/>&quot;Accumulation of PG and stress&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>Populations with a given initial cell density and cooperator frequency were <lb/>prepared, distributed into a 96-multiwell plate and incubated for 15.5h (T1). Then, <lb/>1/10 of each well was transferred into a new 96-multiwell plate with LB, Km, Sp and <lb/>the specified gm concentration. This plate is again incubated for 8.5h (T2). At the end <lb/>of T2 we plated whole well content on LB agar plates and counted CFU after 48hrs at <lb/>30 o C. <lb/>Antibiotic sensitivity <lb/>Overnight cultures were reseeded and grown for 4h at 30 o C to reach exponential <lb/>phase. Aliquots of this culture containing ~10 6 cells were resuspended into a 96-<lb/>multiwell plate with LB and a given dose of gm, incubated for 2h or 4h, plated and <lb/>counted. For experiments with the nP strain, Km and Sp were added to the LB <lb/>medium. For experiments with cells in stationary phase, overnight cultures were <lb/>used directly in the initial inoculation. We used additional wells without antibiotic in <lb/>parallel to obtain a reference population size. We express the sensitivity to the <lb/>antibiotic as &quot;fraction surviving&quot; (population size after exposure to antibiotic / <lb/>reference population size without antibiotic). <lb/>Effect of synthetic quorum-sensing on gentamicin tolerance <lb/>Overnight cultures of nonproducers were resuspended into LB with Km, Sp and the <lb/>indicated concentrations of synthetic quorum-sensing molecule (C4-HSL). Then, we <lb/>proceeded with the antibiotic sensitivity assay as described above. <lb/>Mutation rate <lb/>We generated replica populations of the nP strain and initial density of ~1 cell/well. <lb/>We distributed these cultures in 96-multiwell plates and allowed them to grow for <lb/>15.5h (T1). We plated the whole well content on LB agar plates with the specified gm <lb/>dosage and counted viable cells. From the distribution of gm R CFU observed in a set <lb/>of replica populations the mutation rate was estimated with a maximum likelihood <lb/>method as described in 30 , using the online application &quot;FALCOR: Fluctuation Analysis <lb/>Calculator&quot; <lb/>(http://www.keshavsingh.org/protocols/FALCOR.html ) <lb/></body>
