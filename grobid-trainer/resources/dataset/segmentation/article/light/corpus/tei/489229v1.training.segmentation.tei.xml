			<front>Abstract <lb/>Considering the benefits that students report when evaluating <lb/>physical education classes, the purpose of the present study was to analyse <lb/>the relationships between the assignment of student responsibility in the <lb/>evaluation, motivational variables and the satisfaction with the physical <lb/>education classes, using The Theory of Self-determination as a support <lb/>method. The sample for this study was 922 students, of both genres and in <lb/>Compulsory Secondary Education, aged between 14 and 18 years. To carry <lb/>out the study, the Student&apos;s Scale of Responsibility was used in the physical <lb/>education assessment, the Basic Psychological Needs Measuring Scale, the <lb/>Percentage Scale for Physical Education Causality and the Satisfaction Scale <lb/>in Physical Education. The results of the structural equations model revealed <lb/>a good adjustment to the data. This finding highlights the importance of giving <lb/>responsibilities to the students in the evaluation process, in order to satisfy the <lb/>psychological needs of the students and, therefore, self-determined <lb/>motivation, thus increasing satisfaction towards physical education classes. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Physical education (PE) has become a framework for many youngsters <lb/>to carry out physical activities, which then increases their motivation and <lb/>adherence to do exercise after school [1, 2, 3]. <lb/>The teacher is one of the main promotors of the practising of physical <lb/>activities [4], for which their figure is crucial for the students to increase, or <lb/>not, their level of regular physical activity [5]. However, in PE there are still <lb/></body>

			<page>3 <lb/></page>

			<body>authors [6, 7] who indicate that, traditionally, teaching has consisted in a <lb/>pedagogical model of direct instruction. <lb/>Research has determined that the teacher&apos;s use of strategies, with <lb/>positive psychological aspects, such as the increase of students&apos; intrinsic <lb/>motivation in PE classes, will allow for the development and consolidation of <lb/>behaviours related to physical activity [8, 9, 10]. <lb/>Motivational phenomena combining a set of biological, emotional, <lb/>cognitive and social aspects, which at the same time are interrelated with <lb/>each other, influence persistence, intensity and frequency of behaviour, and <lb/>interact with each other by increasing, maintaining or decreasing this <lb/>behaviour [11]. <lb/>One of the theories that helps to explain the motivation of students in <lb/>PE classes is called the Self-determination Theory (SDT) [12, 13]. The SDT, <lb/>proposes that motivation is framed throughout a three-level continuum [14, <lb/>15]: autonomous motivation (the most self-determined, required for an activity <lb/>to be carried out for sheer pleasure), controlled motivation (carrying out an <lb/>activity for reward or recognition outside of the activity) and demotivation (the <lb/>least self-determined) [16]. <lb/>Furthermore, it establishes three Basic Psychological Needs (BPN): <lb/>autonomy (the desire to engage in activities by one&apos;s own choice), <lb/>competence (the desire to interact efficiently with the means to feel <lb/>competent) and relatedness (the desire to feel part of a group) [16, 12]. <lb/>According to the SDT, the BPN constitute the psychological mediators <lb/>that influence the three main types of motivation [12, 17]. Several studies <lb/></body>

			<page>4 <lb/></page>

			<body>have used the BPN as mediators that positively predict the more self-<lb/>determined forms of motivation [18, 19, 20]. <lb/>The Hierarchical Model of Motivation (HMM) [21] associates BPN with <lb/>the SDT [22]. According to the HMM, the pedagogical model used by the <lb/>teacher will influence the satisfaction of the BPN and, consequentially, the <lb/>level of autonomous motivation of the student. The level of self-determined <lb/>motivation achieved can help to positively or negatively predict the cognitive, <lb/>affective and behavioural results. As a result, the students who experience <lb/>positive results in PE, such as enjoyment and the intention to be physically <lb/>active, present a more self-determined, and therefore more autonomous <lb/>motivation [23, 24] than the students that experience negative results like <lb/>boredom. It is most likely that the latter demonstrate controlled motivation or <lb/>demotivation and that they will run a greater risk of giving up physical activity <lb/>and sport [25]. The model establishes that the social aspects of the <lb/>environment (background variables) influence motivation, depending on the <lb/>achievement or not of a series of BPN (autonomy, competence and <lb/>relatedness), where satisfaction increases the degree of intrinsic motivation <lb/>(motivational variables) [12, 16] and will lead to positive consequences on a <lb/>cognitive, affective and behavioural level (consequent variables). <lb/>In PE classes, a linear and mechanistic pedagogical model has been <lb/>predominant, oriented towards the psychometric results of students at the <lb/>expense of social and cognitive results [26]. However, a climate in which <lb/>responsibility is given to the student will generate positive thoughts about <lb/>physical activity [27]. Different studies have revealed that when the teacher <lb/>provides students with autonomy and responsibility, they value more highly <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>the PE classes and their enjoyment also increases [28, 29, 30]. In a recent <lb/>study [31], with 532 students, guided by the TAD hypothesis, it was concluded <lb/>that the student profiles of PE classes were mainly autonomous ones. <lb/>Evaluation can be considered as an instrument for monitoring and <lb/>evaluating the results obtained by a student. The teacher can employ a more <lb/>controlling teaching style, where more importance is given to results than to <lb/>the learning process, or a teaching style that favours the autonomy of the <lb/>student, where the student is a participant in their own learning process, using <lb/>techniques such as self-evaluation, co-evaluation or hetero-evaluation [32]. <lb/>Given the importance of the process in the achievement of results by the <lb/>students, in this study, as a prior variable to the motivational variables, the <lb/>perception of the assigning of student responsibility was used in the <lb/>evaluation. <lb/>According to Hortigüela-Alcalá et al. [32], students take pleasure from <lb/>being offered different strategies and alternatives to achieve their goals; This, <lb/>in turn, increases intrinsic motivation towards classes and thereby the <lb/>likelihood of students exercising outside of the classroom [33, 34]. Studies like <lb/>that of Yonemura et al. [35], indicated that student participation in evaluation <lb/>produced an increase in their commitment to learning. In the same way, it <lb/>revealed the importance of proposing different strategies for evaluation in <lb/>which student participation is included [36, 37]. Likewise, other authors [38, <lb/>39, 40, 41] highlight the importance of PE and sport being directed towards <lb/>student autonomy and the designation of student responsibilities, claiming <lb/>that a teaching style that gives subjects the chance to choose, participate and <lb/>make decisions in classes, will give rise to a more enjoyable participation and <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>an increase in intrinsic motivation [18, 42, 43]. Therefore, students need to be <lb/>given the opportunity to participate, by being given responsibilities. [44, 45, <lb/>46]. <lb/>Following the HMM, the consequent variable of the present study was <lb/>satisfaction with PE classes. According to Herrera-Mor et al. [47], the <lb/>enjoyment that is experienced from an activity, understood as satisfaction in <lb/>relation to pleasure and well-being, allows for participation to remain <lb/>throughout time, for a greater adherence and for participation to become an <lb/>integral part of lifestyle. <lb/>Similarly, enjoyment can be understood as the valued sense of the <lb/>activities carried out in PE classes by the students [48]; and this variable <lb/>(satisfaction with PE classes) is even related to the obtaining of a better <lb/>academic qualification [49, 50]. As some studies have indicated, to avoid the <lb/>abandonment of physical activity, teachers must try to make activities fun and <lb/>avoid those which are not entertaining [51], thus presenting the teacher with <lb/>an essential role to play in the development of these activities [52]. <lb/>In this regard, Ntoumanis [53] explained that when subjects have fun <lb/>they tend to be intrinsically motivated and give more importance to the <lb/>subject. Satisfaction with PE classes will be positively related to the <lb/>satisfaction of BPN as well as to a more self-determined motivation [48, 52]. <lb/>Moreno et al. [54], in a sample of 819 students aged between 14 and <lb/>17 years, discovered that the most self-determined form of motivation <lb/>positively predicted the importance given to PE classes and with this, <lb/>satisfaction with the same. <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>In relation to satisfaction, motivation and boredom with PE classes, as <lb/>several studies have shown [10, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], high levels of self-<lb/>determination are associated with greater effort, enjoyment, the importance of <lb/>PE and the development of positive behaviour. In contrast, if motivation is less <lb/>self-determined, the consequences will be negative, such as boredom in <lb/>classes [9, 60]. <lb/>Thus, the objective for this study was to analyse the relationships <lb/>between the designation of student responsibility in evaluation, motivational <lb/>variations and student satisfaction with PE classes, through obtaining a model <lb/>of structural equations. Specifically, the hypothesis of the study was that the <lb/>perception of the assignment of student responsibility during evaluation would <lb/>positively predict the satisfaction of the BPN, positively predicting autonomous <lb/>motivation, which would positively predict the satisfaction with PE classes. <lb/>Material and methods <lb/>Research design <lb/>The study carried out was correlational of a transversal style, in which <lb/>the variables described above have not been altered or manipulated, only <lb/>what occurs with them under natural conditions having been observed [61]. <lb/>Likewise, it is located within quantitative empirical studies and, within <lb/>these, it refers to the descriptive study of populations through surveys [62]. <lb/>Sample <lb/>The study sample was 922 students of both sexes (430 male and 492 <lb/>female) from compulsory secondary education, more specifically from 3rd and <lb/>4th year of secondary school. <lb/></body>

The ages of the sample were <lb/>between 14 and 18 years (M = 14.95, SD = .98). <lb/>In Table 1, the distribution of the sample in terms of gender and year-<lb/>group can be seen. <lb/>Table 1.

			<body>In this section, the variables present in this investigation are revealed, <lb/>divided according to the HMM: antecedent, motivational and consequent. In <lb/>addition, a description is given of the instruments used to measure each of <lb/>them. <lb/>Antecedent variables and measurement tools <lb/>Level of responsibility of the student during evaluation: In order to know <lb/>the perception of the level of responsibility that is given to the student in the <lb/>evaluation, The Scale of Student Responsibility during Evaluation in Physical <lb/>Education (ERAEEF) was used, adapted to Spanish by Moreno et al. [63]. It is <lb/>made up of 11 items divided into 2 factors. In the present study, the factor <lb/>known as the value of the transfer of responsibility in the result of the <lb/>evaluation was used composed of 5 items (E.g. Working with the PE teacher <lb/>to decide my score is important). Thus, in the Confirmatory Factor Analysis <lb/>(CFA), the results showed acceptable adjustment indices [64]: χ2 = 55.00, gl <lb/>= 19, p = .00, χ2 / df = 2.89, CFI = .99, TLI = .98, RMSEA = .05 (IC 90% = .03, <lb/>.06). <lb/>Motivational variables and measurement tools <lb/>Basic Psychological Needs: To measure the satisfaction of the BPN, <lb/>the Basic Psychological Needs Measurement Scale (BPNMS) was used, the <lb/>original scale of Vlachopoulos &amp; Michailidou [65] and validated to Spanish by <lb/>Moreno et al. [66]. It is composed of 12 items divided into 3 factors. Each <lb/>factor is made up of 4 items: Satisfaction of the BPN of Competence (E.g. The <lb/>exercises that I perform are in line with my interests), Satisfaction of the BPN <lb/>of Competence (E.g. I do the exercises effectively), Satisfaction of the BPN of <lb/>Relatedness (E.g. I feel that I can communicate openly with my colleagues). <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>Regarding the CFA, the results showed acceptable adjustment indices [64]: <lb/>χ2 = 57.79, df = 24, p = .00, χ2 / df = 2.41, CFI = .99, TLI = .99, RMSEA = .04 <lb/>(IC 90% = .03, .05). <lb/>Levels of Self-Determined Motivation: To measure the levels of self-<lb/>determined motivation, the Perceived Locus of Causality in Physical <lb/>Education (PLOC) was used. Original scale by Goudas et al. [67], and <lb/>validated in Spanish by Moreno et al. [13]. It consists of 20 items divided into <lb/>5 factors. In the present study, a single factor has been used, autonomous <lb/>motivation, composed of the grouping of intrinsic motivation (E.g. Because I <lb/>enjoy learning new skills) and identified regulation (E.g. Because it is <lb/>important for me to do well in PE). Regarding the CFA, the results showed <lb/>acceptable adjustment indices [64]: χ2 = 296.79, gl = 62, p = .00, χ2 / gl = <lb/>4.35, CFI = .96, TLI = .97, RMSEA = .06 (90% CI = .05, .07). <lb/>Consequent variables and measurement tools <lb/>Satisfaction Level and Boredom in PE classes: To measure the level of <lb/>satisfaction or boredom that students present in PE classes, the Basic Needs <lb/>in Sport Satisfaction Scale (BNSSS) was used. A scale validated for sports by <lb/>Duda &amp; Nicholls [68] and validated to Spanish by Balaguer et al. [69]. It is <lb/>composed of 8 items divided into two factors, of which only satisfaction with <lb/>PE classes was used, with 5 items (E.g. Normally I find PE interesting). Thus, <lb/>in the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), the results showed acceptable <lb/>adjustment indices [64]: χ2 = 5.29, df = 2, p = .00, χ2 / df = 2.65, CFI = .99, <lb/>TLI = .99, RMSEA = .06 (IC 90% = .04, .09). <lb/>In all of the questionnaires that were used, answers were given to all of <lb/>the items through a Likert Scale of 5 points, with a range from 0, which means <lb/></body>

			<body>the student is in complete disagreement, to 5, meaning that the student <lb/>completely agrees. <lb/>Procedure <lb/>Having defined the objectives of the study, the measurement <lb/>instruments were selected in order to collect information, a dossier was <lb/>prepared, and some interesting data was gathered, such as age, school year, <lb/>the practice of extracurricular physical activity and the school to which the <lb/>students belonged. Subsequently, the different schools were contacted and <lb/>the objective of the study was explained. They were given a consent form for <lb/>the parents to sign, as the students were under 18 years of age. <lb/>Following this, specific days were chosen for visiting the schools and <lb/>handing out the questionnaires to those subjects with parent authorisation, <lb/>never in the presence of the PE teacher. <lb/>The time employed for the completion of the questionnaires was 40 <lb/>minutes per class. <lb/>Data analysis <lb/>The Confirmatory Factorial Analysis (CFA) was performed in order to <lb/>verify the internal consistency of the questionnaires, and later, once the <lb/>different variables were created, the descriptive statistics. The corresponding <lb/>variables were created with the factors that showed adequate reliability <lb/>indexes. Normality tests were performed, in order to determine what type of <lb/>statistics should be used. The measurements of asymmetry, kurtosis, <lb/>Kolmogorov-Smirnov, with the correction of Lilliefors, verified that the <lb/>distribution of the sample was normal, for which parametric statistics were <lb/>applied. <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>Then, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was employed, as it is <lb/>considered to be the most effective tool for the study of causal relationships in <lb/>non-experimental data [70]. <lb/>The values p &lt; .05 and p &lt; .01 were used for statistical significance. <lb/>Validity was also examined through confirmatory factor analysis, respecting <lb/>the criterion of eliminating those items with a regression weight that did not <lb/>present an adequate value (greater than .40) [72]. <lb/>Regarding the CFA and SEM, they were carried out with Mplus [73], <lb/>version 7.11. These analyses reveal some coefficients or fit indexes that allow <lb/>us to check the validity of the variables of the instruments. These indexes of <lb/>goodness of fit are the chi-square (χ2), the degrees of freedom (gl), the <lb/>significance (p), the χ2 / gl, the RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of <lb/>Approximation), the index CFI (Comparative Fit Index) and the Tucker-Lewis <lb/>Index (TLI). The χ2 / gl is considered acceptable when it is lower than 5, the <lb/>RMSEA with values lower than .05, and the CFI and TLI with values higher <lb/>than .90 [64, 74]. <lb/>For the reliability, descriptive, asymmetric, kurtosis and correlation <lb/>analyses, the statistical program SPSS 21.0 was used. <lb/>For the analysis of reliability, two indices were used, Cronbach&apos;s Alpha <lb/>(α) (equal to or greater than .70) [75], and Omega Coefficient (ω) [76], which <lb/>also serves to check the internal consistency of the variables used in the <lb/>investigation and, according to some authors (77), have shown evidence of <lb/>greater accuracy. This means that in McDonald&apos;s Omega Coefficient the <lb/>established range is between 0 and 1, with the highest values giving us the <lb/>most reliable measurements [77]. With the Omega Coefficient of McDonald, <lb/></body>

			<body>the calculations were made with the &quot;psych&quot; 1.4.2.3 [71] of R 3.0.3 (RCore-<lb/>Team, 2014). <lb/>Results <lb/>Descriptive, reliability, asymmetry and kurtosis <lb/>statistics <lb/>Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics of the instruments used for <lb/>this study. This table shows the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD) of all <lb/>study variables, observing that, in terms of BPN, the highest mean value was <lb/>for the need for relatedness, which is equal to the satisfaction with PE <lb/>classes, with the lowest average being the BPN of autonomy. <lb/>The results from the reliability analysis are also observed, in order to <lb/>check the internal consistency of the questionnaires. All the factors were <lb/>accepted and used in the analyses, given that Cronbach&apos;s Alpha (α) was <lb/>equal to or greater than .70 [75] and that the Omega Coefficient of McDonald <lb/>has high, close to 1 [77]. <lb/>Table 3.

			<body>In accordance with the normality rules proposed by Curran et al. [78] all <lb/>of the variables comply with the univariate normality, since the values of <lb/>asymmetry were below 2 and those of kurtosis below 7. These results can be <lb/>seen in Table 4. <lb/>Table 4.

The results are shown in Fig. 1. <lb/></body>

All of the parameters <lb/>are standardised, the most statistically significant are indicated with *p &lt; .01. <lb/>The contribution of each of the factors to the prediction of other <lb/>variables was examined through the standardised regression weights, hence, <lb/>the value of the assignment of responsibility in the result of the evaluation <lb/>predicted in a positive and significant way the satisfaction of the BPN of <lb/>autonomy (β = .72), competence (β = .87) and relatedness (β = .70). On the <lb/>other hand, autonomous motivation was predicted in a positive way by the <lb/>satisfaction of the BPN of autonomy (β = .49), competence (β = .43) and <lb/>relatedness (β = .04), with self-motivation predicting in a positive and <lb/>meaningful way the satisfaction with PE classes (β = .85). <lb/>The results of the model of structural equations revealed a good <lb/>alignment to the data [64, 74], as can be seen in Table 5. <lb/>Table 5.

However, the results <lb/>demonstrate that the indirect effects of the assigning of student responsibility <lb/>in evaluation upon autonomous motivation vary according to the production <lb/>level, via the satisfaction of the BPN of autonomy, which was β=.35. The <lb/>satisfaction of the BPN of competence being β=.37 and the satisfaction of the <lb/>BPN of relatedness β=.03. Regarding the variable for the value of assigning <lb/>students with responsibility during evaluation, we obtained that, via the <lb/>satisfaction of students in PE classes and autonomous motivation, β=.30, via <lb/>the satisfaction of the BPN of competence β=.32 and, via the satisfaction of <lb/>the BPN of relations and autonomous motivation β=.02. <lb/>Discussion and conclusions <lb/>Given the relevance of assigning responsibility to the student in the <lb/>evaluation for improving motivational processes and increasing student <lb/>satisfaction with PE classes, the present study aimed to validate a model that <lb/>would analyse these relationships from the HMM. The hypothesis stated that <lb/>the perception of the assignment of responsibility to the student during <lb/></body>

			<page>17 <lb/></page>

			<body>evaluation would positively predict the satisfaction of the BPN, which would <lb/>positively predict autonomous motivation, in turn positively predicting the <lb/>satisfaction with PE classes. <lb/>In terms of the results previously mentioned, It can be observed that <lb/>the hypothesis was fulfilled, as it was already demonstrated that the <lb/>perception of the assignment of responsibility to the student in the evaluation <lb/>predicted in a positive and significant way the satisfaction of the BPN <lb/>(autonomy, competence and relatedness), and that the satisfaction of the <lb/>BPN positively predicted autonomous motivation, with a significant prediction <lb/>of the BPN of autonomy and competence. Finally, the most self-determined <lb/>form of motivation positively and significantly predicted satisfaction with PE <lb/>classes. <lb/>In line with the model obtained, Moreno et al. [80] showed that <lb/>responsibility positively predicted psychological mediators, and this predicted <lb/>intrinsic motivation, which positively predicted the importance that students <lb/>give to physical education, and this, finally, positively predicted the student&apos;s <lb/>intention to continue playing sports. <lb/>Other studies have demonstrated that when students are offered the <lb/>opportunity to choose tasks they improve their skills, their physical activity and <lb/>their perceived competence [81]. It was also proven that there was a greater <lb/>learner involvement when given the opportunity to make decisions with <lb/>various methodological aspects such as space, time, material or grouping <lb/>[82]. <lb/>Motivation involves a set of emotional, cognitive and social <lb/>phenomena, with which, according to studies, if a teaching style is used <lb/></body>

			<page>18 <lb/></page>

			<body>where students are allowed to participate in the teaching-learning process, the <lb/>cognitive and physical involvement will be greater [83]. This explains a greater <lb/>satisfaction towards PE classes, and a greater commitment to learning, as <lb/>students are more intrinsically motivated thanks to their involvement in the <lb/>evaluation process [35]. Research carried out by Vera [30], with 49 students, <lb/>also showed that the assignment of responsibilities to the students makes the <lb/>satisfaction of the BPN of autonomy higher, and with it the satisfaction and <lb/>enjoyment towards physical activity. <lb/>It has been confirmed that one key aspect to improving motivation is <lb/>the assignment of responsibility to the student [18], along with the use of <lb/>styles that favour the autonomy of the students [84]. Thanks to different works <lb/>[18, 42], which are in line with our results, it can be affirmed that an <lb/>assignment of responsibilities increases the most self-determined forms of <lb/>motivation. The study by Gómez-Rijo et al. [85], reached the conclusion that <lb/>the transfer of responsibilities to the student, by the teacher, contributes to the <lb/>development of student autonomy. It also demonstrated [85] that giving <lb/>autonomy to the student for the learning of physical skills improves <lb/>autonomous motivation. <lb/>Evaluation must not only be linked to the teacher giving a score, but <lb/>the student must be given the possibility to decide and intervene, taking into <lb/>account initial and bidirectional agreements [87]. Other works developed in <lb/>the educational field [88, 89], that related the satisfaction of the BPN to the <lb/>self-determined forms of motivation, revealed, like in our study, that an <lb/>adequate satisfaction of the BPN would increase intrinsic motivation. <lb/></body>

			<page>19 <lb/></page>

			<body>The authors of these works have shown that a greater feeling of <lb/>autonomy will increase intrinsic motivation [8, 9, 53, 60, 90, 91] and with this, <lb/>satisfaction when participating in activities [39, 40, 41], supporting the results <lb/>found in this study. However, other authors, performing intervention <lb/>programmes to support teachers with the BNP, did not find significant results <lb/>in intrinsic motivation [91]. <lb/>A teaching-style where autonomy and decision-making is stimulated <lb/>will reduce the demotivation of the students, as well as boredom with PE <lb/>classes [94], as pointed out in the study by Moreno et al. [93]. Different works <lb/>have indicated that the less self-determined forms of motivation and a lower <lb/>perception of satisfaction of BPN [95] are related to the giving up of physical <lb/>activity, which may be due to the lack of satisfaction with the PE classes. <lb/>Other studies which had similar results to ours, indicate that an <lb/>increase in autonomy will make satisfaction with PE classes higher [82], and <lb/>that students will be more involved in their tasks and their own learning <lb/>process [82]. Different investigations, such as the one carried out by Méndez <lb/>et al. [94], found that if a suitable atmosphere that involves the task is <lb/>generated in the classroom, the satisfaction of the BPN will be greater, which <lb/>will be positively related to more self-determined motivation and with less <lb/>boredom with the classes of PE. <lb/>Research that is also related to our variables [48, 52, 54, 55], indicated <lb/>that the satisfaction of the BPN predicted high levels of intrinsic motivation <lb/>and that this was related to an increase in enjoyment and satisfaction with <lb/>classes. It can therefore be said that there is a close relationship between <lb/></body>

			<page>20 <lb/></page>

			<body>intrinsic motivation and satisfaction with classes [24, 96]. Some authors, in <lb/>their results give particular importance to the BPN of autonomy [61, 98]. <lb/>As many researchers have been proposing for some time [36, 37, 98], <lb/>it is necessary to come up with new evaluation strategies which offer more <lb/>student involvement. Strategies such as developing the students&apos; ability to <lb/>reflect on what they have done, substitute the final exam for a continuous <lb/>process in which the students learn from their mistakes and successes, <lb/>involve the student in making decisions, among others, which will mean that, <lb/>based on the theoretical postulates of the HMM, the satisfaction of the BPN <lb/>will be higher, as well as that the more self-determined forms of motivation will <lb/>be increased, with levels of demotivation decreasing. This will have positive <lb/>consequences, such as satisfaction with PE classes, and therefore, increase <lb/>the possibility of physical activity outside the classroom. <lb/>One of the limitations found in this study was the sample, which would <lb/>be interesting to expand to other areas and even differentiate by age, gender <lb/>and socioeconomic level. Another limitation was seen from only using <lb/>questionnaires, as only opinion is determined through a scale of answers. It <lb/>would be interesting to make a methodological triangulation, using systematic <lb/>observation and the use of interviews, both with students and with teachers. <lb/>Once the results are known, a longitudinal or quasi-experimental study could <lb/>be carried out, through an intervention that would allow us to establish cause-<lb/>effect relationships, in order to know the effect caused by the application of <lb/>different motivational strategies in the variables under analysis. <lb/>In conclusion, thanks to results from models such as ours, in PE <lb/>classes intervention programmes are necessary to achieve more self-<lb/></body>

			<page>21 <lb/></page>

			<body>determined motivation of our students, using different strategies such as <lb/>posing tasks that are fun for them, by assigning them with responsibilities, <lb/>proposing self-evaluation activities, as well as reciprocal evaluation so that <lb/>they feel they are participants in their teaching and learning process. In this <lb/>way, we can achieve that the students increase their levels of satisfaction of <lb/>the BPN, which will lead to them showing higher levels of autonomous <lb/>motivation in the classes and, consequently, to their satisfaction with the PE <lb/>classes being greater. <lb/></body>
