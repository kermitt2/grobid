However, it is unknown whether increases in woody species and fire <lb/> will interact to exacerbate changes in structure, function and composition of these ecosys-<lb/>tems. Here we use field surveys and experimental manipulations to examine warming and <lb/>fire effects on recruitment, growth and survival of seedlings of evergreen obligate seeding <lb/>alpine shrubs. We find that fire substantially increased shrub seedling establishment (up <lb/>to 32-fold) and that warming doubled tall shrub seedling growth rates and could increase <lb/>survival. Warming had limited or no effect on shrub recruitment, post-fire gap-infilling by <lb/>grass, or competitive effects of grass on shrub seedling growth and survival. These findings <lb/>indicate that rising temperatures coupled with more frequent or severe fires will likely exac-<lb/>erbate increases in tall evergreen shrubs by increasing recruitment, doubling growth rates, <lb/>and potentially increasing shrub survival. <lb/></front>

			<body>Accurately forecasting the effects of climatic warming on vegetation dynamics requires an <lb/>understanding of the mechanisms by which climate and vegetation interact. Most forecasting <lb/>models include the direct effects of climatic conditions on species distributions, but largely ig-<lb/>nore biotic interactions and the type, frequency and severity of disturbances that are also likely to <lb/>change 1-3 . Because disturbance strongly influences recruitment opportunities, and thus, composi-<lb/>tion and structure of plant communities and biomes worldwide 4, 5 , it has the capacity to exacerbate <lb/>or diminish how climate affects vegetation. Seedlings are the life stage most vulnerable to climate <lb/>and disturbance, and the life stage which determines the long-term persistence of a species and <lb/>its capacity to establish in new areas. Consequently, it is imperative to understand how seedlings <lb/></body>

			<body>respond to both changing climate and disturbance regimes 6, 7 . <lb/>Field manipulative experiments have been widely used to investigate the effects of climate <lb/>change on plant communities. These experiments have provided invaluable information on how <lb/>climate change directly influences plant phenology 8, 9 , reproduction 10 , morphology 11 , growth 12 , <lb/>floristic composition 13 and biotic interactions 14 . However, because disturbances vary both spatially <lb/>and temporally, most have focused on mature plant responses in relatively undisturbed vegetation 7 . <lb/>As such, few field climate experiments have been conducted on seedlings or vegetation in post-<lb/>disturbance conditions (but see 15-17 ). Consequently, little is known about how climate change in-<lb/>fluences seedling demographic rates 7 and thus, vegetation recovery in post-disturbance conditions. <lb/>We consider these issues in Australian alpine heathland. <lb/>In alpine and arctic ecosystems, warming experiments and long-term monitoring have doc-<lb/>umented significant increases in the growth and cover of woody species 18-20 . The frequency and <lb/>extent of wildfires have also increased in these environments over recent decades, a trend expected <lb/>to continue 21-24 . In alpine and tundra ecosystems, current evidence from long-term and experimen-<lb/>tal studies indicate that shrub recruitment and encroachment is highest in disturbed areas 25-27 , that <lb/>climatic warming is likely to increase woody species growth rates 20, 28, 29 , and that shrubs are the <lb/>most flammable component of these ecosystems 30-32 . The combination of this evidence indicates <lb/>that more frequent or severe fire may increase recruitment opportunities for woody species, which <lb/>when coupled with higher growth and survival rates caused by rising temperatures, will exacerbate <lb/>shrub expansion 33, 34 and ultimately increase the likelihood of fire 20, 31, 32 . In effect, warming could <lb/></body>

			<body>strengthen an existing feedback loop that not only has the potential to cause rapid changes in the <lb/>composition and structure of alpine and arctic vegetation, but also has serious social, biodiversity <lb/>and carbon sequestration consequences 35 . <lb/>While paleoecological studies have indicated that such a feedback may exist 31, 32 , there is a <lb/>paucity of information on multiple mechanisms that may strengthen, mitigate or break this feed-<lb/>back loop (Fig. 1a). For example, we have little information on whether fire will stimulate shrub <lb/>seedling recruitment in alpine or tundra ecosystems, nor do we know how rates of seedling growth <lb/>and survival will be affected under warmer, more exposed, post-fire conditions. Furthermore, we <lb/>do not know how tussock grasslands (the other dominant community in these ecosystems) will <lb/>respond to warmer post-fire conditions, whether grasses have competitive, facilitative or no effect <lb/>on shrub seedling vital rates, or whether such effects are altered by warmer post-fire conditions. <lb/>We examine these unknowns and their impacts on the feedback between climatic warming, <lb/>shrubs and fire in Australian alpine vegetation. As with tundra ecosystems, the Australian Alps <lb/>have experienced rapid changes in climate. Since 1979, mean growing season temperatures have <lb/>risen by approximately 0.4°C and annual precipitation has fallen by 6% 36 , with a consequent de-<lb/>cline in snow pack depth 37 . These climatic changes have been correlated with a 10 to 20% increase <lb/>in shrub cover and a 25% decline in graminoids cover 36 . Much of the Australian Alps has also been <lb/>burnt by recent wildfires, the frequency and severity of which are expected to increase 24, 38 . <lb/>We took advantage of recent fires in alpine open heathland, a plant community that occupies <lb/>ca. 25% of the Australian alpine landscape 38 . Under global warming, this plant community is likely <lb/></body>

			<body>to encroach upon grasslands and is itself susceptible to shrub thickening 39 . To determine drivers <lb/>of shrub establishment and how warmer post-fire conditions affect shrub cover, we combined field <lb/>observations with a warming experiment that used seedlings of four Australian evergreen obligate <lb/>seeding shrubs: Grevillea australis (Proteaceae; a tall shrub), Asterolasia trymalioides (Rutaceae; <lb/>a prostrate shrub), Phebalium squamulosum (Rutaceae; a tall shrub) and Prostanthera cuneata <lb/>(Lamiaceae; a tall shrub). This combination of data sources allowed us to examine: 1) landscape <lb/>scale drivers of shrub seedling establishment; 2) how warmer post-fire conditions influence rates <lb/>of grass recovery and shrub seedling recruitment, growth and mortality; 3) how proximity to grass <lb/>affect shrub seedling demographic rates; and 4) whether such grass effects change under warmer <lb/>post-fire conditions. <lb/>Drivers of shrub seedling establishment. We first investigated how altitude, Topographic Wet-<lb/>ness Index (TWI), adult density, fire and fire severity (as measured by post-fire twig diameters-see <lb/>Supplementary Methods) influenced the density of Grevillea and Asterolasia seedlings (the two <lb/>dominant shrubs of alpine open heathland). In 2011-12, we estimated seedling density for both <lb/>species across 40 alpine sites and found that the abundances of Grevillea (Fig. 2) and Asterola-<lb/>sia (Supplementary Fig. S1) seedlings were strongly influenced by the occurrence of fire. Sites <lb/>burnt in 2003 had seedling densities between 14 and 32 times higher than unburnt sites. The mean <lb/>seedling density of Grevillea, was 1.3/m 2 at burnt sites and 0.04/m 2 at unburnt sites. Asterolasia <lb/>had similar mean densities: 1.63 and 0.12 seedlings/m 2 at burnt and unburnt sites, respectively. For <lb/>both species, seedling density was also higher in severely burnt sites (i.e. sites with larger post-<lb/>fire twig diameters). As expected, pre-fire adult density positively influenced Grevillea seedling <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>density. For both shrub species, we detected no change in seedling density along a 190 m altitu-<lb/>dinal range (equivalent to a 1.5°C change in mean temperature 40 ). The field warming experiment <lb/>(see below) indicates that this lack of elevation response in Grevillea is due to rates of recruitment <lb/>(Supplementary Fig. S2) and mortality (see below) largely being insensitive to a 1°C change in <lb/>temperature. We detected no strong effect of Topographic Wetness Index for either species. <lb/>Experimental warming effects on shrub seedling growth. As shrub seedlings were more abun-<lb/>dant in burnt vegetation, we investigated how warmer post-fire conditions affected seedling growth <lb/>and mortality rates. Seedlings of Grevillea, Asterolasia, Phebalium and Prostanthera emerging <lb/>after a wildfire were transplanted into experimentally burnt plots. These plots were either enclosed <lb/>in Open Top Chambers (OTCs) whose temperature was 1°C warmer than control plots subjected to <lb/>current ambient conditions. After 1813 days (1087 growing season days) or 5 years&apos; growth, mean <lb/>seedling heights of the tall shrubs (Grevillea, Phebalium and Prostanthera) growing in post-fire <lb/>bare ground were greater in warmed plots relative to controls by 9.7, 3.8 and 13.8 cm, respectively <lb/>(Fig. 3a). Warming increased heights of both Grevillea and Prostanthera seedlings in all years, <lb/>while Phebalium did not respond to the warming treatment until the second growing season. By <lb/>contrast, seedlings of the prostrate shrub, Asterolasia, showed no difference in growth rate between <lb/>warmed and control plots in any year. For each species, we also observed similar treatment trends <lb/>with stem diameter growth (Supplementary Fig. S3). Accounting for initial height and assuming <lb/>logistic growth, the rates of change in mean annual predicted height of Grevillea, Phebalium and <lb/>Prostanthera were 2.4, 1.4 and 1.9 times that observed in control plots, respectively. According to <lb/>this model, a 6 cm seedling (the mean initial height of seedlings used in this experiment) attains <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>maximum height 39 years sooner 38 (Grevillea) or 17 years sooner (Phebalium and Prostanthera) <lb/>when warmed by 1°C (Fig. 3b). Asterolasia was predicted to reach its maximum height in approx-<lb/>imately 22 to 24 years, irrespective of warming treatment. <lb/>We validated the Grevillea and Asterolasia growth responses observed in experimentally <lb/>warmed plots by examining the effect of elevation on maximum heights of post-fire recruits across <lb/>30 open heathland sites burnt in 2003. Here, a 190 m altitudinal range is equivalent to a mean <lb/>ambient temperature difference of approximately 1.5°C 40 , which is comparable to that observed <lb/>between experimentally warmed and control plots (1°C). In response to shifts in temperature, the <lb/>maximum height of Grevillea post-fire recruits was expected to decrease with elevation, whereas <lb/>Asterolasia seedlings were not expected to show this pattern. Our experimental predictions were <lb/>verified (Supplementary Fig. S4). Mean maximum height of Grevillea seedlings in burnt open <lb/>heathland were 8 cm taller at 1670 m a.s.l compared to seedlings at 1860 m a.s.l. (22 cm vs 14 <lb/>cm; a difference comparable to our experimental findings). In contrast, mean maximum height of <lb/>Asterolasia seedlings did not vary significantly with elevation. Topographic Wetness Index and <lb/>fire severity had no detectable influence on maximum seedling heights in either species. <lb/>Experimental warming on shrub seedling mortality. After five years and across all plots, 34% <lb/>(172 out of 511) of all seedlings growing in burnt bare ground patches had died. Most deaths <lb/>occurred in Asterolasia (65) followed by Phebalium (63), Grevillea (31) and Prostanthera (13). <lb/>Prostanthera showed the largest treatment effect (Fig. 4), with annual mortality rates estimated to <lb/>be near 0% in warmed plots and 4% in control plots. This significant decrease in mortality may <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>be a consequence of OTCs reducing the severity of spring frosts by rising minimum ambient and <lb/>soil temperatures by 0.9°C and 1.6°C, respectively (see Supplementary Fig S5-7). Warming also <lb/>reduced mean seedling mortality in Grevillea and Phebalium (Fig. 4); however, for both species, <lb/>the effect was highly uncertain (i.e. credible intervals overlap). By contrast, annual mortality rates <lb/>in the prostrate shrub, Asterolasia, were marginally higher in warmed plots, but again this effect <lb/>was highly uncertain (Fig. 4). <lb/>Effects of tussock grass proximity on shrub seedling growth and mortality rates. Climate <lb/>change is expected to alter biotic interactions because their strength and direction depend strongly <lb/>on climatic conditions, particularly in alpine and arctic ecosystems 14, 41 . Here, we assess the inter-<lb/>active effects of warming and grass proximity on the growth and survival of Grevillea seedlings <lb/>transplanted into various sized inter-tussock gaps (Fig. 5). We detected a strong positive effect <lb/>of warming treatment on growth rates and a marginal, yet not significant, decrease in mortality. <lb/>However, we did not detect significant inter-tussock gap size effects or an interaction between gap <lb/>size and warming treatment on either growth or mortality rates (i.e. coefficient credible intervals <lb/>overlap zero). <lb/>Experimental warming and rates of gap infilling by tussock grass. Despite having little impact <lb/>on shrub seedling growth and mortality rates, tussock grass may still limit shrub recruitment, and <lb/>thus, shrub expansion, by infilling post-fire bare ground gaps (whether by vegetative growth or <lb/>seedlings) faster under warmer conditions. Using five years of post-fire inter-tussock gap size <lb/>changes in warmed and unwarmed plots we found that gaps were being infilled by tussock grasses <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>(Fig. 6). However, the rate at which this occurred was very slow, with a 10 cm radius gap predicted <lb/>to decrease by approximately 2 cm over a ten year period. We also detected no significant effect <lb/>of a 1°C temperature rise on the rate of infilling. <lb/>Strengthening of the warming-shrub-fire feedback. Here we quantified several unknown inter-<lb/>actions between fire, shrub-grass relationships and climate to extend a conceptual model of alpine <lb/>shrub dynamics under climate change (Fig. 1b). We showed how these interactions strengthen a <lb/>hypothesized feedback loop that can rapidly increase shrub cover in alpine and tundra ecosystems 31 . <lb/>The combination of rising temperatures and more frequent or severe fire creates conditions that <lb/>allow shrub seedlings to establish in greater densities, and for tall shrubs, double their growth <lb/>rates and potentially increase their survival. These demographic effects will ultimately result <lb/>in shrub thickening and expansion into grasslands. Coupled with field 30 , experimental 42 and <lb/>paleoecological 31 evidence, which indicate that shrubs are the most flammable component of alpine <lb/>and tundra ecosystems, our results suggest that flammable fuel loads will accumulate faster and <lb/>cover a larger proportion of the alpine and arctic landscapes under a warmer environment. This <lb/>further strengthens the feedback 31, 32 by potentially increasing the frequency or severity of fires, <lb/>which then creates further recruitment opportunities for shrubs with little demographic impact of <lb/>neighbouring tussock grass. <lb/>While we have addressed several unknowns associated with this feedback between climatic <lb/>warming, shrubs and fire, there are others we have not addressed that may also strengthen, weaken <lb/>or break this feedback. The most obvious mechanism that will break this cycle involves shorter <lb/></body>

			<page>9 <lb/></page>

			<body>fire intervals that prevent obligate seeding shrubs reaching reproductive age and thereby exhausting <lb/>the seedbank. However, this scenario is unlikely for the majority of alpine (or tundra) landscapes, <lb/>including in Australia, where current fire intervals of 50 to 100 years would need to decrease to less <lb/>than 20 years-the time estimated for the species in this study to reach reproductive maturity 43 . <lb/>Furthermore, if reproductive output is related to plant size 44 , then climatic warming may allow <lb/>obligate seeding species to reach reproductive maturity sooner, and consequently, may increase <lb/>species resilience to short fire intervals. Nevertheless, these factors and others such as changes in <lb/>snow pack 45 , soil moisture 46 or herbivory 47 require further research because they are likely to be <lb/>altered by the interactive effects of climate and disturbance in unpredictable ways 20 . <lb/>Our findings provide mechanistic understanding as to why shrub cover has increased, of-<lb/>ten at the expense of grasslands, in many alpine and arctic ecosystems 20, 27, 33, 34 . But more im-<lb/>portantly, our results provide evidence for underlying processes that could result in a warming-<lb/>fire-shrub feedback that has been hypothesized in paleoecological studies 31, 32 . Based on current <lb/>observations and predictions, average global temperature has already increased by 0.85°C since <lb/>1880 and is expected to rise by as much as 4.8°C by 2100 48 . In alpine and tundra environments, <lb/>temperatures 49 , shrub cover 20 and the frequency and severity of fire 21-24 have all increased in the <lb/>last few decades. These changes mean that the warming-shrub-fire feedback loop identified here <lb/>has already strengthened, which could cause grasslands and other non-woody communities to tran-<lb/>sition to an alternative state with more shrubs and more fire, both of which are likely to have <lb/>consequences for carbon sequestration, water supply and biodiversity. <lb/></body>

			<body>Methods <lb/>We investigated shrub dynamics in open heathland because it is a common and highly flammable <lb/>plant community in the Australian Alps above 1600 m a.s.l 30 . It is also an ecotone between closed <lb/>heathland (&gt;70% shrub cover) and tussock grassland consisting of Grevillea australis shrubs in-<lb/>terspersed among a Poa hiemata sward. Aerial photography has revealed that the plant community <lb/>has acted as an invasion front of shrub expansion into grassland and has itself experienced shrub <lb/>thickening by closed heathland dominants such as Prostanthera cuneata 39 . <lb/>Open Top Chamber Experiment. In March 2010, at 1750 m a.s.l, we burnt 32 randomly selected <lb/>mature (60 cm tall and 1.5 m 2 ) Grevillea australis shrubs in open heathland to create patches of <lb/>bare ground approximately 0.7 m 2 surrounded by burnt tussock grass, simulating disturbance in <lb/>open heathland burnt by wildfire. After creating the bare ground patches we collected seedlings of <lb/>dominant alpine shrub species from a nearby (&lt;2 km) site of similar altitude burnt by a late 2006 <lb/>wildfire. We collected shrub seedlings of two dominant open heathland species Grevillea australis <lb/>(Proteaceae; a tall shrub) and Asterolasia trymalioides (Rutaceae; a prostrate shrub), a dominant <lb/>closed heathland species Prostanthera cuneata (Lamiaceae; a tall shrub) that typically grows on <lb/>warmer aspects and a species common to both open and closed heathland Phebalium squamulosum <lb/>(Rutaceae; a tall shrub). All four species are killed by fire 50 . <lb/>A total of 640 seedlings, 256 Grevillea (half used in Poa inter-tussock experiment-see <lb/>below) and 128 for each of Asterolasia, Prostanthera and Phebalium were used. Four seedlings <lb/>per species were randomly selected and transplanted into a 4×4 square grid in the center of each <lb/></body>

			<body>burnt patch, with 14 cm between individuals and the edge of the patch dominated by resprouting <lb/>tussock grass Poa hiemata. To examine interactions between tussock grass and shrub seedlings we <lb/>also randomly transplanted four additional Grevillea australis into various sized inter-tussock gaps <lb/>between burnt Poa hiemata immediately surrounding the bare ground (Supplementary Fig. S8). <lb/>The experimental site was fenced to prevent grazing by deer and horses. We detected no obvious <lb/>signs of rabbit or invertebrate herbivory within our plots. <lb/>To simulate near-term warmer conditions indicated by the IPCC 48 , we randomly assigned <lb/>Open Top Chambers (OTCs) to half (16) the plots, with the remainder treated as unwarmed con-<lb/>trols. OTCs were placed over plots, ensuring all seedlings (including inter-tussock shrub seedlings) <lb/>occurred within the 1.1 m 2 open top to minimise edge effects. OTCs were placed out at the start <lb/>of the growing season (October) where they remained until snowfall (early June). This procedure <lb/>was repeated for five growing seasons from May 2010 to May 2015. <lb/>Microclimatic conditions were measured hourly using Onset Micro Stations (Onset Com-<lb/>puter Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) at four control and four OTC plots. Across 5 growing <lb/>seasons (1087 growing season days), OTCs simulated warmer conditions at the lower end of IPCC <lb/>projections 48 (Supplementary Fig. S5-7). OTCs passively increased average ambient and soil tem-<lb/>peratures by 1°C, and 0.9°C, respectively. Minimum and maximum temperatures were also raised <lb/>in both ambient air (min: 0.9°C; max: 2.4°C) and soil (min: 1.6°C; max: 1°C). Chambers only <lb/>marginally decreased soil moisture by 0.2% and relative humidity by 1.2%. <lb/>Seedling survival, maximum height and stem diameter (nearest mm measured with Vernier <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>calipers) were initially recorded in May 2010 and then subsequently re-measured at the end of each <lb/>growing season (May-June). At the same time, we recorded the distance to the nearest tussock or <lb/>grass seedling in each of four cardinal directions for shrub seedlings growing in inter-tussock <lb/>gaps. Thus, changes in inter-tussock gap size could be due to either vegetative growth or seedling <lb/>establishment. We did not measure individual characteristics (e.g. height and basal diameter) of <lb/>surrounding tussock grass because we could not distinguish individuals, and because height varied <lb/>throughout the season. Numbers of natural Grevillea australis recruits establishing within the plots <lb/>were also recorded for the first two seasons. <lb/>Seedling gradient study. We used 40 long-term open heathland sites established after the 2003 <lb/>fires 50 consisting of 30 burnt sites and 10 sites thought to be unburnt for over 70 years. In the <lb/>summer of 2011-12, at each site, seedling density/m 2 was estimated using 40 quadrats, each 1 m 2 , <lb/>that were evenly distributed in groups of 10 along four 50 m transects, with 10 m between transect <lb/>lines, subsampling an area of 2000 m 2 . Within plots we recorded the number and maximum <lb/>height of Grevillea and Asterolasia seedlings. For unburnt sites we counted the number of mature <lb/>Grevillea plants (&gt;0.5 m 2 ) within 5 m of each transect. In burnt sites, this required counting the <lb/>number of skeletons (there were no living adults at any burnt site) that still persisted post-fire. We <lb/>were unable to estimate numbers of adult Asterolasia because this species does not have a persistent <lb/>woody skeleton post-fire. Site level data, elevation and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) were <lb/>obtained from a 30 m resolution digital elevation model. Lastly, for burnt sites, fire severity was <lb/>estimated by twig diameters, collected immediately after the 2003 fires 50 . <lb/>Data analysis. In total we built 11 hierarchical models to examine factors influencing post-fire <lb/></body>
