Recent <lb/>imaging studies suggest accelerated maturation of the white matter in young children with ASD, with underlying <lb/>mechanisms unknown. Myelin is an integral part of the white matter and critical for connectivity; however, its role in <lb/>ASD remains largely unclear.

We further <lb/>identified that myelination in the frontal brain of both male and female neonatal BTBR mice was increased, associated <lb/>with elevated levels of myelin basic protein. However, myelin pattern was unaltered in adult BTBR mice, revealing <lb/>accelerated developmental trajectory of myelination. Consistently, we found that signaling of platelet-derived growth <lb/>factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) was reduced in the frontal brain of neonatal BTBR mice. However, levels of microRNA <lb/>species known to regulate PDGFRα signaling and myelination were unaltered. Together, these results suggest that <lb/>precocious myelination could potentially contribute to increased volume and connectivity of the white matter <lb/>observed in young children with ASD. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects multiple brain <lb/>regions and probably involves impaired connectivity <lb/>among them 1-4 . Consistent with altered connectivity, <lb/>abnormal white matter growth and reduced white matter <lb/>integrity have been reported in patients with ASD 1,3,5 , <lb/>including atypical development of white matter micro-<lb/>structure observed in young patients 6-15 . In addition, <lb/>white matter maturation is associated with development <lb/>of social cognition in early childhood 16 , and altered white <lb/>matter connectivity probably contributes to core symp-<lb/>toms of ASD including atypical social communication 17 . <lb/>Although changes during early development may be <lb/>critical to the pathogenesis of ASD, they may disappear, or <lb/>may even be reversed later in life 18 . A notable example is <lb/>that children with ASD have increased brain size at early <lb/>childhood, but in older children and adults, decreases in <lb/>structural volumes are observed instead 19-25 . In a related <lb/>vein, reduced size of the corpus callosum in children and <lb/>adults with ASD has been a consistent finding 26 ; however, <lb/>a recent study of infants &lt;2 years of age showed that the <lb/>corpus callosum was larger in those who later developed <lb/>ASD 27 . Together, these observations strongly suggest that <lb/>alterations are dynamic but not uniform across the life-<lb/>span of ASD patients, and developmental trajectory could <lb/>be a critical component of the etiology. <lb/>In terms of functional and structural connectivity, evi-<lb/>dence suggests that hyper-connectivity may be more <lb/>characteristic of young children with autism, while hypo-<lb/>connectivity may be more prevalent in adolescents and <lb/>adults 18 . In older children, adolescents, and adults with <lb/></body>

			<body>ASD, restriction of water diffusion (often measured by <lb/>fractional anisotropy, FA, using neuroimaging methods) <lb/>in white matter tracts is usually reduced, suggesting <lb/>functional hypo-connectivity. On the other hand, recent <lb/>imaging studies in patients 1-4-years-old have reported <lb/>that they display greater volume and increased FA of fiber <lb/>tracts in mostly frontal regions of the brain, but a slower <lb/>rate of continued development 6-15 . <lb/>The mechanisms underlying altered trajectory of white <lb/>matter development remain unclear, especially regarding <lb/>the involvement of the myelin sheath, a fundamental <lb/>component of the white matter. Myelin formation con-<lb/>tinues even decades after birth in the human brain. It <lb/>enables saltatory conduction of action potentials along <lb/>myelinated axons and regulates the timing of information <lb/>integration in neural networks 28 . In addition, myelin also <lb/>provides trophic and metabolic support to the axons . <lb/>During development, the timing of myelination is critical <lb/>as myelin stabilizes axon structure and wiring pattern in <lb/>neural networks. However, due to the limitations of <lb/>neuroimaging methods and the dearth of studies using <lb/>animal models (a few such studies so far have shown <lb/>delayed myelination in general using animal models), <lb/>development of myelin during the course of ASD has <lb/>largely remained unknown 30 . <lb/>Here, we investigated myelin development in a mouse <lb/>model of idiopathic ASD, the BTBR T + Itpr3 tf /J (BTBR) <lb/>inbred strain. In addition to robust behavioral phenotype <lb/>that models core autism-like impairments 31-35 , a striking <lb/>anatomical feature of the BTBR mice is agenesis of the <lb/>corpus callosum 36-38 . Dysgenesis of the corpus callosum <lb/>has been considered a major risk factor for ASD 39 , and <lb/>atypical developmental trajectory of the size and micro-<lb/>structure of the corpus callosum has been one of the most <lb/>replicated neuroimaging findings in the patient popula-<lb/>tion 26,27 . Here, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <lb/>revealed that fiber tracts in the frontal brain of the BTBR <lb/>mice had increased volume at postnatal day 6, but the <lb/>difference reduced over time, reminiscent of the findings <lb/>in young patients. We further identified accelerated <lb/>myelination during the neonatal stage, compared with <lb/>other inbred lines. We observed this phenomenon in both <lb/>male and female BTBR mice, and found that it involves <lb/>increased levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and <lb/>reduced platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha <lb/>(PDGFRα) signaling. <lb/>Methods and materials <lb/>Animals <lb/>Breeder C57BL/6 J (B6) and BTBR animals were <lb/>obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (ME) and the lines <lb/>were maintained at the mouse facility of the Cumming <lb/>School of Medicine, University of Calgary. Mice were <lb/>housed in a humidity-and temperature-controlled room <lb/>with a 12-h light/dark cycle and were fed ad libitum. Both <lb/>neonatal (between postnatal day 2 to day 12, specified in <lb/>the results section for individual experiment), adolescent <lb/>(P35), and adult (8 to 10 week old) B6 and BTBR male <lb/>animals were used. Female neonatal B6 and BTBR mice <lb/>were also examined. The 129S6 (129) inbred strain was <lb/>originally purchased from Taconic (NY). Experiments on <lb/>BTBR mice and B6 or 129 mice were performed in par-<lb/>allel. All procedures in this study were performed in <lb/>accordance with the recommendations from the Canadian <lb/>Council for Animal Care. The protocol for this study was <lb/>approved by the Health Sciences Animal Care Committee <lb/>of the University of Calgary. <lb/>MRI analysis <lb/>Preparation of brains for scanning <lb/>Initially the mice are anesthetized with ketamine/xyla-<lb/>zine and intracardially perfused with 30 ml of 0.1 M PBS <lb/>containing 10 U/ml heparin (Sigma) and 2 mM ProHance <lb/>(a Gadolinium contrast agent) followed by 30 ml of 4% <lb/>paraformaldehyde (PFA) containing 2 mM ProHance. <lb/>Perfusions were performed with a minipump at a rate of <lb/>approximately 1 ml/min. After perfusion, mice were <lb/>decapitated and the skin, lower jaw, ears, and the carti-<lb/>laginous nose tip were removed. The brain and remaining <lb/>skull structures were incubated in 4% PFA + 2 mM Pro-<lb/>Hance overnight at 4°C then transferred to 0.1 M PBS <lb/>containing 2 mM ProHance and 0.02% sodium azide for at <lb/>least 7 days prior to MRI scanning. <lb/>Image acquisition <lb/>Images were acquired on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner (Varian <lb/>Inc., Palo Alto, CA) 40,41 . The contrast required for image <lb/>registration and assessment of volume is not sufficient <lb/>with our typical T2-weighted imaging sequence. There-<lb/>fore, diffusion-weighted imaging was performed to <lb/>enhance the contrast between white and gray matter to <lb/>aid in the registration and volume measurements. <lb/>Diffusion imaging sequence <lb/>The diffusion sequence uses an in-house custom built <lb/>16-coil solenoid array to acquire images from 12 brains in <lb/>parallel 42 . The diffusion sequence used was a 3D <lb/>diffusion-weighted FSE, with TR = 270 ms, echo train <lb/>length = 6, first TE = 30 ms, TE = 10 ms for the remain-<lb/>ing 5 echoes, one average, FOV = 25 mm × 14 mm × <lb/>14 mm, and a matrix size of 450 × 250 × 250, which yiel-<lb/>ded an image with 56 µm isotropic voxels. One <lb/>b = 0 s/mm 2 image was acquired and 6 high b-value (b = <lb/>2147 s/mm 2 ) images were acquired in the following <lb/>directions (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (−1, 1, 0), (−1, 0, 1), <lb/>and (0, 1, −1) corresponding to (G x , G y , G z ). Total ima-<lb/>ging time was~14 h. <lb/></body>

			<body>Registration and analysis <lb/>To visualize and compare the mouse brains for anato-<lb/>mical volume assessment, the 6 high b-value images were <lb/>averaged together to make a high contrast image neces-<lb/>sary for accurate registration. Then these images were <lb/>linearly (6 parameter followed by a 12 parameter) and <lb/>nonlinearly registered together. All scans were then <lb/>resampled with an appropriate transform and averaged to <lb/>create a population atlas representing the average anat-<lb/>omy of the study sample. All registrations were performed <lb/>using a combination of the mni_autoreg tools 43 and <lb/>ANTS 44 . The result of the registration was to have all <lb/>scans deformed into exact alignment with each other in <lb/>an unbiased fashion. For the volume measurements, this <lb/>allowed for the analysis of the deformations needed to <lb/>take each individual mouse&apos;s anatomy into this final atlas <lb/>space, the goal being to model how the deformation fields <lb/>relate to genotype 40,45 . The Jacobian determinants of the <lb/>deformation fields are then calculated as measures of <lb/>volume at each voxel. These measurements were exam-<lb/>ined on a voxel-wise basis in order to localize the differ-<lb/>ences found within regions or across the brain. Multiple <lb/>comparisons were controlled for by using the False Dis-<lb/>covery Rate (FDR) 46 . <lb/>Fluorescent immunohistochemical staining and image <lb/>acquisition <lb/>Brain tissue was processed and a free-floating staining <lb/>method was used according to previously described <lb/>methods 47 . Briefly, after cardiac perfusion, brains were <lb/>removed and post-fixed, embedded in gelatin, cryopro-<lb/>tected in 30% sucrose, sectioned in the coronal or sagittal <lb/>plane using a cryostat. Sections were then incubated with <lb/>primary (anti-MBP, Millipore, MAB386, 1:500; anti-<lb/>CNPase, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, <lb/>531796, 1:500; anti-PDGFRα, BD biosciences, Clone <lb/>APA5, 558774, 1:500; anti-Olig2, R&amp;D Systems, AF2418, <lb/>1:50; anti-CC1, Millipore, OP80, 1: 2,000) and corre-<lb/>sponding secondary antibodies 47 , as well as DAPI, before <lb/>being mounted onto slides. Images were then acquired <lb/>with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope or a Leica SP8 <lb/>confocal microscope. For an overview of myelination, tile <lb/>scans using a ×20 lens were conducted and the images <lb/>were stitched together using Zen software (Zeiss). <lb/>Cell counting <lb/>Z-stack confocal images spanning 20 μm depth were <lb/>collapsed and PDGFRα-positive cells were counted using <lb/>Imaris from both P2 and P8 animals in the following three <lb/>brain areas: dorsal lateral striatum, somatosensory cortex, <lb/>and external capsule, as the BTBR mice do not have <lb/>crossing corpus callosum. Four to six collapsed image <lb/>stacks from each brain region of each animal were used. <lb/>CC1-positive cells were imaged and counted in external <lb/>capsule region from P8 mice. Four to six images from <lb/>each animal were used. <lb/>Western blot <lb/>Brain regions of interest from mice of indicated ages <lb/>were dissected on ice and homogenized in RIPA buffer <lb/>(Pierce Biotechnology, MA) with protease and phospha-<lb/>tase inhibitor cocktails (Roche, QC). Homogenate was <lb/>centrifuged at × g for 10 min at 4°C. In all, 10-20 μg <lb/>of the protein extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, and <lb/>transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After <lb/>blocking, blots were incubated with primary and corre-<lb/>sponding secondary antibodies, and visualized with an <lb/>enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Bands <lb/>were imaged and quantified using a ChemiDOC MP gel <lb/>imaging system (Bio-Rad, CA). The following primary <lb/>antibodies were used: PDGFA, Santa Cruz, 1:100; <lb/>PDGFRα, Santa Cruz, sc-338, 1:200; MBP, Millipore, <lb/>MAB386, 1:100 (neonatal tissue) or 1:500 (adult tissue); <lb/>PLP, Santa Cruz, sc-98781, 1:400; actin, Cell Signaling, <lb/>4967, 1:10,000. The relative expression levels of a protein <lb/>were quantified by normalization using actin levels. When <lb/>quantifying western blot results, full size images without <lb/>any saturation were used. In addition, images of longer <lb/>exposure time were taken to ensure that the location of <lb/>even the weakest band was clear when drawing the region <lb/>of interest for analysis. <lb/>Quantitative RT-PCR <lb/>RNA was isolated from striatum using RNeasy mini kit <lb/>(Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA <lb/>using an iScript gDNA Clear cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-<lb/>Rad). qRT-PCR was performed using 10 ng of cDNA in a <lb/>20-μL reaction using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-<lb/>Rad). Primer pairs (IDT) were used at a concentration of <lb/>0.375 μM. qPCR was performed in duplicate using the <lb/>following protocol: 95°C 2 min, 40 cycles of 95°C 15 s and <lb/>60°C 30 s, and then 75°C 10 s, followed by a melt curve <lb/>procedure on a Bio-Rad CFX96 qPCR machine. Cycle <lb/>thresholds (Ct) were determined by the software CFX <lb/>manager (Bio-Rad).

			<body>For microRNA quantification, total RNA was isolated <lb/>from brain samples using miRCURY RNA isolation kit <lb/>(Exiqon) according to the manufactures instructions <lb/>using the modified protocol for fatty tissue. cDNA was <lb/>synthesized from 10 ng total RNA using a universal cDNA <lb/>synthesis kit (Exiqon). qRT-PCR was performed using <lb/>0.05 ng of cDNA in a 10-μL reaction using Exilent syber <lb/>green (Exiqon). LNA primer mixes (Exiqon) were used. <lb/>qPCR was performed in duplicate using the following <lb/>protocol: 95°C 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C 10 s and 60°C <lb/>60 s, and then 60°C 5 s, followed by a melt curve proce-<lb/>dure on a Bio-Rad CFX96 qPCR machine. <lb/>Geometric mean of the Ct values of the housekeeping <lb/>genes were calculated using the program BestKeeper 48 , to <lb/>obtain reference Ct values. The relative abundance of <lb/>transcript of genes of interest was then analyzed using the <lb/>REST software 49 . <lb/>Transmission electron microscopy, image collection, and <lb/>computation of the g-ratio <lb/>Brain areas of interest were rapidly dissected. A por-<lb/>tion of the optic nerve anterior to the optic chiasm was <lb/>used. Dissected tissue was then immersed in 2% paraf-<lb/>ormaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacody-<lb/>late buffer at pH 7.4 for 2 h at 4°C. After washing three <lb/>times with the same buffer, the samples were post-fixed <lb/>in 1% osmium tetroxide buffered with cacodylate for 1 h <lb/>at room temperature, dehydrated through a graded ser-<lb/>ies of ethanol and embedded in Spurr&apos;s resin. Thick <lb/>sections were cut, stained with 1% toluidine blue and <lb/>examined using a light microscope in order to select <lb/>appropriate areas. Ultrathin sections were cut with a <lb/>Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome using a diamond knife <lb/>and stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Rey-<lb/>nolds&apos;s lead citrate. Optic nerve, external capsule (BTBR <lb/>mice do not have crossing corpus callosum) and dorsal <lb/>striatum at indicated ages were analyzed. Samples were <lb/>observed using a Hitachi H7650 transmission electron <lb/>microscope at 80 kV. Images were taken through an <lb/>AMT600 digital camera mounted on the microscope. <lb/>Images were collected from multiple (more than 3 for <lb/>optic nerve at P9 and more than 7 for corpus callosum <lb/>and striatum at adulthood), randomly chosen locations <lb/>of each sample. <lb/>To quantify the relative thickness of the myelin sheath, <lb/>g-ratios were computed for individual axons 50 . Both the <lb/>inner perimeter around the axon and the outer perimeter <lb/>around the intact myelin sheath were outlined manually <lb/>using ImageJ and a custom code was used to quantify the <lb/>pixels in the inner and outer perimeters. Then the inner <lb/>axonal diameter and the total outer diameter including <lb/>the myelin sheath were computed and the ratio of the two <lb/>(g-ratio) was plotted against axonal diameter. This pro-<lb/>cedure allowed for inclusion of irregularly shaped axons <lb/>and helped to eliminate bias based on circularity . <lb/>Totally, 316 axons in corpus callosum and 280 axons in <lb/>striatum of four B6 mice, and 346 axons in corpus cal-<lb/>losum and 291 axons in striatum of four BTBR mice were <lb/>analyzed. Experimenters who counted myelinated axons <lb/>or outlined axonal and myelin sheath perimeter were <lb/>blind to the genotype of the samples. <lb/>Statistical analysis <lb/>All sample sizes (n) are numbers of animals used. <lb/>Sample sizes were determined based on similar published <lb/>studies and the observed results. Student&apos;s t-test was <lb/>performed to determine statistical significance between <lb/>the sets of BTBR and B6 data, assuming two-tailed dis-<lb/>tribution and two-sample unequal variance. Distribution <lb/>normality was calculated using Shapiro-Wilk test. If the <lb/>data were not normally distributed, Mann-Whitney U <lb/>test was used instead. Values represented the mean ± <lb/>SEM, except the qRT-PCR results, which were repre-<lb/>sented by box and whisker plots generated by the REST <lb/>program. Two-way repeated measure ANOVA followed <lb/>by post hoc Tukey&apos;s test was used to compare distribution <lb/>of axonal area in the optic nerve between the B6 and <lb/>BTBR mice. One-way ANOVA or one-way ANOVA on <lb/>ranks (when normality test failed) followed by post hoc <lb/>test was used to compare relative expression levels of <lb/>MBP and PLP among BTBR, B6, and 129 strains of mice. <lb/>*P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.001. <lb/>Results <lb/>Increased volume of white matter tracts in frontal brain <lb/>regions of the BTBR mice during neonatal development <lb/>We first explored whether atypical development of <lb/>white matter, similar to that in human patients, was also <lb/>observed in the BTBR model. To this end, we measured <lb/>volumes of white matter tracts in neonatal male BTBR <lb/>brains at postnatal day 6 (P6), P8 and P10 using mag-<lb/>netic resonance imaging (MRI). The results were com-<lb/>pared with that from age-matched male B6 mice, which <lb/>display normal levels of sociability and repetitive beha-<lb/>viors and are most often used as the control strain for <lb/>the BTBR mice in autism-related studies 31-35 . Brains of <lb/>ten mice of each strain at each age were imaged and <lb/>analyzed. Results revealed that at P6, four (lateral <lb/>olfactory tract, anterior commissure pars anterior, optic <lb/>tract, and posterior commissure) out of 13 white matter <lb/>tracts had significantly increased volumes in the BTBR <lb/>mice (false discovery rate all &lt;0.007), while the volumes <lb/>of the other fiber tracts were not statistically different <lb/>from those in the B6 mice, with most displaying a trend <lb/>of decreased volume (Fig. 1a). At P8 and P10, the <lb/>increase in the volume of lateral olfactory tract, anterior <lb/>commissure pars anterior, and posterior commissure <lb/>was reduced so that the BTBR and B6 brains had similar <lb/></body>

			<body>volumes of these tracts. The increase in the volume <lb/>of the optic tract in the BTBR brain stayed relatively <lb/>constant for this period. On the other hand, other <lb/>fiber tracts displayed decreased or similar volumes in <lb/>the BTBR brain at these ages (Fig. 1a). Note that the <lb/>corpus callosum in the BTBR mice does not cross the <lb/>midline 36-38 , but instead forms the Probst bundle, and <lb/>started to display significantly decreased volume from <lb/>P8. Together, these data revealed that during this short <lb/>period of early development, white matter tracts in the <lb/>BTBR brain exhibited spatially and temporally dynamic <lb/>alterations compared with the B6 brain: those located <lb/>more anteriorly displayed an initial increase in volumes, <lb/>which reduced rapidly in two out of three cases; whereas <lb/>those located more posteriorly had similar or decreased <lb/>volumes, except that posterior commissure showed an <lb/>initial increase at P6 (Fig. 1a). This is reminiscent of the <lb/>observations from young children with ASD that show <lb/>increased volume of fiber tracts in mostly frontal regions <lb/>of the brain, but a slower rate of continued development, <lb/>resulting in similar volumes of these fiber tracts in older <lb/>children 6-15 . <lb/>Fig. 1 Increased volume of white matter tracts in the frontal brain of the BTBR mice during neonatal development. a Comparison of mean <lb/>volume of white matter tracts at P6, P8, and P10 between B6 and BTBR mice using MRI.

			<body>Increased myelination during neonatal development in the <lb/>frontal brain of both male and female BTBR mice <lb/>Next, we examined whether greater volume of anterior <lb/>fiber tracts in neonatal BTBR brain could be due to <lb/>increased myelination. Results from MRI indicated that <lb/>the optic tract in the BTBR mice had a greater volume <lb/>than that in the B6 mice from P6 to P10 (Fig. 1a). Thus, <lb/>we first examined the optic nerve at P9 using electron <lb/>microscopy and quantified axons with compact myelin in <lb/>cross sections. Results revealed that BTBR mice had sig-<lb/>nificantly greater number of myelinated axons than the B6 <lb/>mice (Fig. 1b), indicating increased myelination could <lb/>contribute to the increased volume of the optic tract in <lb/>the BTBR mice. As axonal size influences initiation of <lb/>myelination in the optic nerve 51 , we measured cross sec-<lb/>tional area of axons in the optic nerve and compared the <lb/>distribution of axonal area between the B6 and BTBR <lb/>mice. Results indicated that there was a trend of an <lb/>increased proportion of the smallest axons and decreased <lb/>proportions of mid-sized ones in the BTBR mice, but no <lb/>significant difference between the two strains at any size <lb/>range we compared (Fig. 1c), suggesting that increased <lb/>volume of the optic tract in the BTBR mice was not due to <lb/>greater volume of individual axons, and that size of the <lb/>axons probably did not contribute to the increased mye-<lb/>lination in this model. <lb/>Next, we probed myelin development using immuno-<lb/>fluorescence staining of myelin basic protein (MBP), an <lb/>integral component and specific marker of myelin 52-56 , <lb/>whose cellular expression pattern has been widely used <lb/>to characterize myelination process. We observed <lb/>increased MBP signal in male BTBR brains at P6, com-<lb/>pared with age-and sex-matched B6 mice. Close exam-<lb/>ination revealed that MBP signal was located in many <lb/>cells in the BTBR frontal brain, including corpus callo-<lb/>sum and dorsal striatum, and to a lesser extent, the <lb/>cortex. Most of the positive cells displayed MBP signal in <lb/>both cell bodies and numerous processes, with some <lb/>already aligned in parallel tube-like structures pre-<lb/>sumably wrapping around axons. On the contrary, only a <lb/>few MBP-positive cells could be identified in the same <lb/>brain regions in the B6 brain, with the signal mostly <lb/>restricted to the cell bodies (Fig. 2a). At P8, MBP signal in <lb/>the BTBR frontal brain showed clear organization of <lb/>myelin sheath in the corpus callosum and dorsal stria-<lb/>tum, with dispersed positive cells in the cortex, while the <lb/>same staining showed mostly scattered signal in the same <lb/>brain regions in the B6 brain (Fig. 2b). A similar differ-<lb/>ence was observed in immunofluorescence staining of <lb/>2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) as <lb/>well (Fig. 2c). In older pups aged P10 (Fig. 2d) and P12 <lb/>(Fig. 2e), MBP signal continued to increase rapidly in <lb/>both mouse strains; however, it spread further into more <lb/>dorsal regions of the cortex and ventral striatum in the <lb/>BTBR than the B6 brain. Totally, we examined two to <lb/>four mice of each strain at each age. <lb/>We also observed similar increased MBP signal in <lb/>female BTBR brains during neonatal development. At P6, <lb/>there were more cells with MBP-positive processes in the <lb/>corpus callosum and dorsal striatum of the BTBR than the <lb/>B6 brain (Fig. 2f). At P8, more widespread MBP signal was <lb/>observed in the corpus callosum and dorsal striatum in <lb/>the BTBR mice (Fig. 2g). Thus, both male and female <lb/>BTBR mice had increased MBP-positive myelin structure <lb/>during neonatal development. <lb/>Increased myelination suggested more abundant mature <lb/>oligodendrocytes in the BTBR brain. Indeed, staining <lb/>against CC1, a specific marker for mature oligoden-<lb/>drocytes, revealed that there was a significant increase in <lb/>the number of positive cells in the BTBR mice compared <lb/>with the B6 mice (Fig. 2h, i), corroborating the notion that <lb/>myelination was elevated in the BTBR mice. <lb/>Upregulated MBP expression accompanied increased <lb/>myelination in neonatal BTBR mice <lb/>As mentioned earlier, MBP is an essential component of <lb/>mature compact myelin in the central nervous system, and <lb/>has been considered as the &apos;executive molecule of myelin&apos;, <lb/>serving multiple functions beyond structural support 52-56 . <lb/>In addition, expression of MBP is a rate-limiting step in <lb/>myelination in the central nervous system 52-56 . Here, we <lb/>further quantified the protein expression level of MBP in <lb/>the striatum, and found it was significantly increased in P8 <lb/>male BTBR mice compared with two other age-and sex-<lb/>matched inbred mouse strains: B6 and 129 (Fig. 3a, c). In <lb/>contrast, the protein levels of myelin proteolipid protein <lb/>(PLP), the most abundant protein of myelin in the central <lb/>nervous system 57,58 , were similar among all three strains of <lb/>mice (Fig. 3b, c), indicating that upregulated MBP protein <lb/>expression is associated with the increased myelination <lb/>observed in the BTBR mice. Further experiments indicated <lb/>that there was no significant difference in the mRNA levels <lb/>of myelin-related genes MBP, CNP, or PLP1, encoding <lb/>MBP, CNP, or PLP, respectively, between the BTBR and <lb/>B6 mice at P8 (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that the <lb/>increased protein level of MBP in the BTBR mice is likely <lb/>due to alterations in translation or post-translational <lb/>processing, instead of transcription of the gene. <lb/>Similar myelin pattern and thickness in adolescent and <lb/>adult B6 and BTBR frontal brain <lb/>We further followed myelin development using immu-<lb/>nofluorescence staining of MBP into older ages. At P35, <lb/>we did not observe any obvious difference in the frontal <lb/>brain between male BTBR and B6 mice (Fig. 4a) (n = 4 <lb/>mice for each strain). In addition, relative protein <lb/>expression levels of MBP and PLP in the striatum were <lb/>also similar between adult male BTBR and B6 animals <lb/></body>

Most of <lb/>the positive cells had MBP signal in both cell bodies and numerous processes, with some already aligned in parallel tube-like structures presumably <lb/>wrapping around axons. On the contrary, only a few MBP-positive cells could be identified in the same brain region in the B6 brain (left panels), with <lb/>the signal mostly restricted to the cell bodies. Dotted lines outline corpus callosum. Boxed region is shown in higher magnification in the right panel <lb/>next to it.

			<body>(Fig. 4b). Using electron microscopy, we observed typical <lb/>myelination pattern and myelin micro structure in corpus <lb/>callosum and dorsal lateral striatum from both adult <lb/>male BTBR and B6 brains (Fig. 4c, d). Furthermore, the <lb/>g-ratios 50 of axons in both brain regions were similar <lb/>between the two strains, indicating that the relative <lb/>thickness of myelin was not altered (Fig. 4e). Thus, <lb/>increased myelination in the frontal brain of the BTBR <lb/>mice only appeared during neonatal development; both <lb/>BTBR and B6 mice reached similar degree of myelination <lb/>at adult stage. <lb/>PDGFRα signaling was reduced in the frontal brain of <lb/>neonatal BTBR mice <lb/>Based on these data, we investigated PDGFRα signaling, <lb/>as it is specifically expressed by oligodendrocyte precursor <lb/>cells (OPCs) 59,60 and critical in regulating the timing of <lb/>their differentiation, such that it is down-regulated when <lb/>OPCs stop proliferation to start differentiation. Extensive <lb/>studies indicate that PDGFRα level is a negative regulator <lb/>of the biological clock controlling the maturation process <lb/>of OPCs 61-67 . Using immunofluorescence staining (Fig. <lb/>5a-d), we found that the number of PDGFRα-positive <lb/>cells were slightly, but not significantly, decreased in the <lb/>corpus callosum, somatosensory cortex, and dorsal stria-<lb/>tum of the BTBR mice compared with the B6 mice at both <lb/>P2 and P8 (Fig. 5e, f). Meanwhile, the protein expression <lb/>level of PDGFRα (Fig. 5g, h) was significantly reduced in <lb/>the frontal brain of the BTBR mice at both P2 and P8 (Fig. <lb/>5i, j), while the expression level of PDGFA, the ligand of <lb/>PDGFRα involved in the timing of OPC differentiation, <lb/>was similar between the two strains (Fig. 5g-j). Thus, <lb/>PDGFRα signaling was reduced in the OPCs in the frontal <lb/>brain of neonatal BTBR mice, consistent with accelerated <lb/>myelin development observed in the same region. <lb/>Recent studies have uncovered important roles of <lb/>microRNAs in regulating myelination during develop-<lb/>ment 68-71 . Several microRNA species, including miR-219, <lb/>338, 138, and 23a, have been shown to inhibit expression <lb/>of PDGFRα 72-74 . Thus, we tested whether changes in <lb/>PDGFRα protein expression observed in the BTBR mice <lb/>could be due to altered levels of these microRNAs. <lb/>Quantitative RT-PCR of these microRNA species in the <lb/>frontal brain showed that there was no difference in <lb/>abundance between BTBR and B6 mice at both P2 and P8 <lb/>(Fig. 5k, l), suggesting that these microRNAs are unlikely <lb/>to contribute to the accelerated myelination observed in <lb/>the BTBR mice. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>Development of myelin in ASD patients <lb/>Although neuroimaging studies on older children, <lb/>adolescents, and adults with ASD have generally shown <lb/>hypo-connectivity of brain circuits, more recent studies <lb/>on young children (1-4 year old) have suggested the <lb/>opposite may be the case, that is, hyper-connectivity <lb/>during early neurodevelopment 6-15 . However, the cellular <lb/>and molecular substrates of the hyper-connectivity <lb/>remain poorly understood. In these studies, increased <lb/>FA and in some cases greater volume were observed <lb/>within several fiber tracts that innervate the frontal lobes, <lb/>commissural fibers, long-range association tracts, and <lb/>thalamocortical projection fibers in the ASD population, <lb/>followed by overall slower than typical apparent rate of <lb/>continued development. Notably, the relationship <lb/>between diffusion and volume measures and severity of <lb/>social and communication symptoms was dependent on <lb/>the age at which the neuroimaging measurement took <lb/>place: greater FA and volume of frontal tracts in early <lb/>years predicted greater symptom severity later at the age <lb/>of final diagnosis, whereas a trend toward the opposite <lb/>relationship (lower FA and volume correlated with greater <lb/>severity) was observed for frontal tracts measured at older <lb/>ages, suggesting that greater abnormality in early growth <lb/>may be associated with greater severity of symptoms <lb/>observed later 6 . One possible reason of increased FA is <lb/>greater extent of myelination. Thus, it could be reasoned <lb/>Fig. 3 Upregulated MBP expression accompanied increased <lb/>myelination.

			<body>histogram peak height and location were significantly <lb/>higher in children with autism, suggesting accelerated <lb/>myelination of the corpus callosum in very young chil-<lb/>dren with autism 30 . <lb/>Histological studies of postmortem patient brain tissue <lb/>have been very rare, especially from samples of young <lb/>children. Ultrastructural investigation of postmortem <lb/>adult brain tissue revealed decreased myelin thickness in <lb/>fibers beneath the orbitofrontal cortex 75 . It would be <lb/>important to determine whether such abnormalities are <lb/>present in young ASD population and how they might <lb/>change over time during development. <lb/>The consequences of accelerated myelination during <lb/>brain development are less well understood. Notably, <lb/>accelerated myelination is frequently observed in infants <lb/>with hemimegalencephaly, a rare neurological condition <lb/>characterized by frequent seizures, usually followed by <lb/>mental retardation 78 , both of which are comorbidities <lb/>of ASD. <lb/>Development of myelin in animal models of ASD <lb/>Studies on myelination using animal models of ASD <lb/>have also been very limited. Thus far, these studies have <lb/>found delayed myelination in general. One study reported <lb/>a delay in myelination accompanied by reduced OPC <lb/>number in the cerebellum, and smaller cerebellar volume <lb/>in Fmr1 knockout mice during early postnatal develop-<lb/>ment. Interestingly, although the amounts of myelin <lb/>specific proteins are reduced in neonatal mutant mice, <lb/>they reach similar levels, or even surpass those observed <lb/>in the wildtype control animals in adulthood . Another <lb/>study showed that maternal immune activation in mice <lb/>delays myelination and axonal development in the hip-<lb/>pocampus, but not cortex, of the offspring, and the defi-<lb/>cits disappear when the animals reach the adult stage 80 . In <lb/>addition, disruption of the tuberous sclerosis complex <lb/>(TSC) leads to hypomyelination 81,82 . Interestingly, in a rat <lb/>model of diffuse white matter injury, which is a major <lb/>complication in preterm infants and associated with <lb/>psychological conditions including ASD, delayed cortical <lb/>myelination and ASD-like behaviors were observed 83 . <lb/>Together, these studies suggest that different etiologies <lb/>underlying ASD may affect development of myelin <lb/>differently. <lb/>Here, our study showed precocious myelination in the <lb/>frontal brain of the BTBR mouse model of ASD. <lb/>According to previous studies, oligodendrocyte matura-<lb/>tion and myelination in neonatal mice around P6 to P12 <lb/>corresponds to term infants (36-40 week) in humans 84,85 , <lb/>when the brain experiences peak growth spurt and glio-<lb/>genesis, and the predominance of oligodendrocyte <lb/>maturation state changes from pre-oligodendrocytes to <lb/>immature oligodendrocytes. Our findings suggest accel-<lb/>erated myelin development could potentially contribute to <lb/>hyper-connectivity and increased brain volume typically <lb/>observed in young children with ASD. However, myelin <lb/>pattern and thickness were unaltered in adult BTBR ani-<lb/>mals, suggesting a blunted developmental trajectory, <lb/>reminiscent of what has been observed in ASD patients. <lb/>Thus, precocious myelination in the BTBR mice could <lb/>potentially serve as a model to investigate the mechanisms <lb/>and consequences of atypical myelin development in ASD. <lb/>Mechanisms underlying precocious myelination in the <lb/>BTBR mice <lb/>MBP has long been recognized as a crucial component <lb/>of mature myelin in the central nervous system. It is <lb/>responsible for adhesion of the cytosolic surface between <lb/>multiple layers of compact myelin. Mice harboring shi-<lb/>verer spontaneous mutation in the MBP gene have poorly <lb/>formed myelin 53 . Further studies showed that the <lb/>expression of MBP is a rate-limiting step in myelination in <lb/>the central nervous system 54,55 . In contrast, ablation of <lb/>other major myelin proteins such as PLP 57,58 and CNP 86 <lb/>seems to induce secondary axonal consequences rather <lb/>than affecting myelination process per se. Besides struc-<lb/>tural functions in myelin, MBP also actively participate in <lb/>other processes during myelination, and thus has been <lb/>referred to as the &apos;executive molecule of myelin&apos; 52,56 . The <lb/>importance of MBP for myelination is supported by the <lb/>notion that the emergence of MBP in ancient jawed fish <lb/>conferred myelination ability, which sped up the velocity <lb/>of nerve conduction more than 20-fold. Without MBP <lb/>and myelin, jawed vertebrates as we know them, including <lb/>humans, could not have evolved 87,88 . Interestingly, we <lb/>observed an increase in MBP protein, but not the mRNA, <lb/>expression levels in the BTBR mice (Fig. 3). As MBP is <lb/>transported in oligodendrocytes as mRNA rather than <lb/>protein, it has been suggested that localized translation of <lb/>MBP is advantageous for rapid and axon-tailored synth-<lb/>esis of the molecule as the required amounts may vary at <lb/>distinct axonal segments, and that localized translation of <lb/>MBP is tightly regulated 89 . Thus, it is plausible that <lb/>altered translation contributes to increased MBP protein <lb/>levels in the BTBR mice. It was also observed that the <lb/>protein levels of MBP appeared quite variable in P8 ani-<lb/>mals even among the same strain of mice (Fig. 3). A <lb/>possible reason was that during neonatal development <lb/>when MBP was just beginning to be expressed and <lb/>increased rapidly, individual variations might be more <lb/>than those when myelination had reached a stable level, as <lb/>observed in adult animals (Fig. 4). <lb/>The role of PDGFRα in determining the timing of OPC <lb/>differentiation has been extensively studied. PDGFRα is <lb/>the only PDGF receptor isoform expressed on OPCs 59,60 . <lb/>During OPC differentiation, expression of PDGFRα in <lb/>OPCs progressively decreases and then is rapidly extin-<lb/>guished in mature oligodendrocytes 63,64 . PDGF is a major <lb/></body>

			<body>mitogen for OPC proliferation 65 , although PDGF signal-<lb/>ing is unlikely the only mechanism determining the final <lb/>numbers of oligodendrocyte 38 , as alterations of its levels <lb/>do not affect the levels of myelin at maturity 90 . Mean-<lb/>while, PDGF signaling has also been shown to inhibit <lb/>differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes. With-<lb/>drawal of PDGF from culture medium triggers differ-<lb/>entiation of OPCs 61,62,65 . Consistently, genetic ablation of <lb/>PDGFRα also leads to precocious differentiation of OPCs <lb/>both in vitro and in vivo, and accelerated myelination 66,67 . <lb/>These results indicate that PDGFRα level is a negative <lb/>regulator of the biological clock controlling the matura-<lb/>tion process of OPCs. Thus, reduced PDGFRα signaling in <lb/>neonatal BTBR brain could potentially result in the <lb/>accelerated myelination we have observed. <lb/>Notably, studies using the BTBR mice have uncovered <lb/>profound alterations in both structural and functional <lb/>connectivity 32,36,91-96 , the most striking one being the <lb/>non-crossing corpus callosum in these animals 31,36-38 . In <lb/>addition, our previous work revealed impaired synaptic <lb/>pruning and dendritic overgrowth during neonatal devel-<lb/>opment in the BTBR brain 97,98 . The relation between these <lb/>changes and the accelerated myelination observed here <lb/>needs to be examined in the future. In addition, the total <lb/>number of axons in white matter tracts in the BTBR mice <lb/>has not been determined. Future studies to examine <lb/>parameters such as whether, where, and to what degree <lb/>axon number may alter could reveal additional axonal <lb/>abnormalities in this mouse model. <lb/>In summary, this study revealed precocious myelination <lb/>in a mouse model of autism. The high prevalence of ASD <lb/>and the grave cost associated with psychological, physio-<lb/>logical, and socioeconomic burden call for improved <lb/>understanding of the early developmental pathophysiol-<lb/>ogy, which may best reveal fundamental biological <lb/>underpinnings of ASD, and would also assist early diag-<lb/>nosis and inform therapeutic options, as well as help to <lb/>identify high-risk individuals. <lb/></body>
