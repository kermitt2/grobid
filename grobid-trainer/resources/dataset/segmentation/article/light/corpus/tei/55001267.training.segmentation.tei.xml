			<body>The compound semiconductors Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 ͑CZTSe͒ <lb/>and Cu 2 ZnSnS 4 ͑CZTS͒ are promising candidates for the <lb/>next generation thin film solar cells. Compared to the current <lb/>high efficiency thin film solar cells Cu͑In, Ga͒Se 2 and CdTe <lb/>they are composed of elements with a higher abundance in <lb/>the Earth crust and a reduced toxicity. <lb/>A prerequisite for high efficiency solar cells is the <lb/>growth of single phase material which, according to theoret-<lb/>ical calculations is very demanding. The chemical potential <lb/>region for stable single phase material without unwanted sec-<lb/>ondary or ternary phases is very small. 1 <lb/>The highest solar cell efficiency so far has been reported <lb/>by Todorov et al. 2 They used a hybrid solution-particle ap-<lb/>proach and achieved an efficiency of 9.7% from a mixed <lb/>Cu 2 ZnSn͑S,Se͒ 4 compound. The highest efficiency from a <lb/>vacuum based process has been reported by Katagiri et al. 3 <lb/>in the case of CZTS ͑6.7%͒ and Zoppi et al. 4 in the case of <lb/>CZTSe ͑3.2%͒. In both cases sputtering has been employed <lb/>to produce a precursor ͓͑Cu,ZnS,SnS͒ ͑Ref. 3͒ or ͑Cu,Zn,Sn͒ <lb/>͑Ref. 4͔͒ which has been subsequently annealed in a chalco-<lb/>gen atmosphere. <lb/>Astonishingly, the coevaporation technique, which is ex-<lb/>tremely useful in the case of Cu͑In, Ga͒Se 2 , shows so far <lb/>poor solar cell results and has been used rarely. 5-7 One rea-<lb/>son might be the loss of Sn at temperatures higher than <lb/>400°C. 5,8,9 It has been shown that this loss is due to the <lb/>formation of SnS ͑SnSe͒ ͑Refs. 5 and 9͒ which has a much <lb/>higher vapor pressure than Sn at the usual substrate tempera-<lb/>tures. Annealing in vacuum even leads to the decomposition <lb/> of CZTS at temperatures higher than 550°C due to SnS <lb/>re-evaporation. 9 However a CZTSe coevaporation process is <lb/>highly desirable since then the Cu͑In, Ga͒Se 2 module pro-<lb/>duction technology can be adopted without any need of fur-<lb/>ther development. <lb/>We have therefore systematically investigated the <lb/>growth of CZTSe at different temperatures and evaporation <lb/>conditions. Especially the influence of the Se partial pressure <lb/>during growth turns out to be very important. Moreover a <lb/>sequence of experiments where the process has been inter-<lb/>rupted reveals the complexity of CZTSe growth by coevapo-<lb/>ration. <lb/>The growth of CZTSe thin films has been carried out in <lb/>a molecular beam epitaxy system with a base pressure of <lb/>5 ϫ 10 −8 mbar without bake-out. Thermal evaporation of Cu, <lb/>Zn, Sn, and Se is accomplished from effusion cells. The sub-<lb/>strate temperature is regulated via a thermocouple, which is <lb/>situated in the vicinity of the sample holder and the surface <lb/>temperature is monitored with a pyrometer. Commercially <lb/>available molybdenum coated soda lime glass is used as sub-<lb/>strate. The temperatures indicated below correspond to the <lb/>substrate temperatures recorded with the pyrometer ͑cali-<lb/>brated to the emissivity of the Mo-coated substrate͒. The <lb/>evaporation rates are measured with a quartz crystal monitor, <lb/>a Bayert Alpert pressure gauge, and an electron impact emis-<lb/>sion spectroscopy system. In all deposition processes the <lb/>metal fluxes have been kept constant ͑Ϸ1-2 Å/s͒ and the <lb/>relative variations between experiments are smaller than <lb/>10%. Elemental concentrations are deduced from an energy <lb/>dispersive x-ray ͑EDX͒ analysis system attached to a scan-<lb/>ning electron microscope ͑SEM͒. The acceleration voltage <lb/>has been set to 20 kV in all measurements. Phase analysis <lb/>has been carried out by x-ray diffraction ͑XRD͒. <lb/>The temperature dependent growth experiments have <lb/>been carried out in an excess Se atmosphere. A Se partial <lb/>pressure of 4 ϫ 10 −6 Torr measured at the substrate position, <lb/>constant Cu, Zn, Sn evaporation rates, and a constant process <lb/>time of 90 min have been used. The elemental concentrations <lb/>as deduced from EDX measurements are shown in Fig. 1 in <lb/></body>

			<body>a temperature range between 320 and 515°C. The results <lb/>can be divided into three regimes. The low temperature re-<lb/>gime ͑I͒ below 350°C shows no significant variations in the <lb/>elemental concentrations with temperature. The films are <lb/>slightly Cu poor ͓Cu/ ͑Zn+ Sn͒ = 0.8͔ and Zn rich ͓Zn/ Sn <lb/>= 1.08͔ which according to the present record cells 2 is ideal <lb/>for solar cells. The temperature independence of the elemen-<lb/>tal compositions reveals that material losses due to re-<lb/>evaporation are not significant in this temperature range. <lb/>At 380°C the Sn signal decreases slightly. The decrease <lb/>becomes more pronounced at 405°C where the Sn concen-<lb/>tration drops by 30% compared to region ͑I͒ whereas the Zn <lb/>concentration stays roughly constant. The decrease in Sn is <lb/>accompanied with a decrease in Se. Increasing the tempera-<lb/>ture to 430°C leads to a complete Sn loss. The Zn concen-<lb/>tration, as depicted in Fig. 1, appears to increase at this point. <lb/>However this change is due to a change in film thickness. As <lb/>will be shown later, at temperatures higher than 350°C a <lb/>ZnSe secondary phase is present at the back of the film. Due <lb/>to the reduced thickness the probing electrons of the SEM <lb/>are sensitive to this secondary phase which increases the ap-<lb/>parent Zn concentration compared to region ͑I͒. Region ͑II͒ <lb/>is therefore characterized by Sn losses. <lb/>A further increase to 515°C ͑region III͒ leads to a com-<lb/>plete loss of Zn and Sn. The resulting film consists only of <lb/>Cu 2−x Se. <lb/>The measurements presented in Fig. 1 show that, de-<lb/>pending on the temperature, up to three of the four elements <lb/>are volatile which makes the growth of uniform CZTSe with <lb/>a desired stoichiometry a difficult task. Before discussing the <lb/>results, a second set of experiments is presented. Here the Se <lb/>partial pressure during growth is varied at a constant sub-<lb/>strate temperature of 380°C, constant metal fluxes and with <lb/>a constant process time of 90 min. This temperature regime <lb/>͓labeled ͑II͒ in Fig. 1͔ corresponds to the intermediate case <lb/>where the incorporation of Sn is still possible. <lb/>Figure 2 shows the elemental concentrations in the films <lb/>deduced from EDX as a function of the Se pressure present <lb/>during growth. Deposition of the metals without the chalco-<lb/>gen does not lead to any incorporation of Zn. XRD reveals <lb/>that the film consists almost exclusively out of Cu x Sn y al-<lb/>loys. Increasing the Se pressure to 5 ϫ 10 −7 Torr leads to a <lb/>strong decrease in the Sn concentration. Zn is still not incor-<lb/>porated and the film consists mainly out of Cu 2−x Se <lb/>and some remaining Cu x Sn y alloys. The film thickness <lb/>is extremely small ͑Ϸ200 nm͒ since no Zn and only little <lb/>Sn is bound. Only after increasing the Se pressure to <lb/>1 ϫ 10 −6 Torr can Zn be incorporated. The film is composed <lb/>of Cu 2−x Se and ZnSe while Sn phases cannot be detected in <lb/>XRD. A further increase in the Se pressure ͓3 ϫ 10 −6 and <lb/>4 ϫ 10 −6 Torr͔ results in an increase in the Sn concentration. <lb/>The film thicknesses increase by one order of magnitude <lb/>compared to the film grown at 5 ϫ 10 −7 Torr. XRD of these <lb/>films reveals that at least part of the film has crystallized in <lb/>the stannite type CZTSe. 10 <lb/>The measurements show that for fixed Zn, Cu, and Sn <lb/>evaporation rates, the film thickness changes by more than <lb/>one order of magnitude and Zn and Sn concentrations de-<lb/>pend strongly on the Se partial pressure. Already at this point <lb/>we can conclude that a prerequisite for control of the com-<lb/>position is an accurate monitoring of the Se pressure since it <lb/>influences dramatically the incorporation of Sn and Zn in the <lb/>film. <lb/>The incorporation of an element proceeds in three steps. <lb/>First the atom adsorbs to the surface, followed by surface <lb/>diffusion. After some time the adatom nucleates or re-<lb/>evaporates. The adsorption rate of each element i is propor-<lb/>tional to the flux of impinging particles f i which is linked to <lb/>the equilibrium vapor pressure p i and temperature T i of the <lb/>source via the following Hertz-Knudsen equation: f i = p i <lb/>ϫ ͑2mk B T i ͒ −0.5 . 11,12 After adsorption the atoms diffuse over <lb/>the surface performing a random walk with a diffusion coef-<lb/>ficient D i . After a certain lifetime i the atom desorbs. Both <lb/>processes follow an Arrhenius law as it is known for ther-<lb/>mally activated processes. Diffusion coefficient and lifetime <lb/>define the characteristic length l i via Eq. ͑1͒ as follows: <lb/>l i = ͱ D i i . <lb/>͑1͒ <lb/>In evaporation or condensation l i describes the covered dis-<lb/>tance of an adatom prior to desorption. 13 Due to the com-<lb/>plexity of the system none of the kinetic parameters for <lb/>CZTSe are available. In order to describe the processes on a <lb/>qualitative level we use the equilibrium situation and link the <lb/>lifetime of the adatoms to the partial pressure of the elements <lb/>at a temperature T. A low partial pressure corresponds to a <lb/>large energy barrier for desorption resulting in a long life-<lb/>time. <lb/>Equation ͑1͒ can now be used to describe the experimen-<lb/>tal observations on a qualitative level. Deposition without Se <lb/>leads to the incorporation of Sn and Cu in the film due to <lb/>their low vapor pressure at 380°C. They exhibit long char-<lb/>acteristic lengths l i and Cu x Sn y alloys form. Zn however is <lb/>not incorporated due to the large vapor pressure at 380°C <lb/>͓cf. Table I͔. Cu-Zn and Sn-Zn alloys can be excluded by <lb/>XRD analysis. Introducing Se into the system leads prefer-<lb/>FIG. 2. ͑Color online͒ ͑a͒ Elemental concentrations of Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se <lb/>deduced from EDX as a function of the Se pressure p Se . <lb/>TABLE I.

			<body>entially to the formation of Cu 2−x Se and SnSe. The formation <lb/>of ZnSe is still suppressed since the characteristic lengths l Sn <lb/>and l Cu are much larger than l Zn . As a result Cu and Sn <lb/>consumes all the available Se, and Zn desorbs. However, the <lb/>formation of SnSe, which has a high vapor pressure ͓cf. <lb/>Table I͔, leads to a reduction in Sn in the film. A further <lb/>increase in the Se partial pressure leads to a complete loss of <lb/>Sn while Zn can now be found in the film. The high Se <lb/>supersaturation is necessary to remove all Sn and to compen-<lb/>sate for the small l Zn . ZnSe forms which exhibits a negligible <lb/>vapor pressure at 380°C. The film consists almost entirely <lb/>of Cu 2−x Se and ZnSe. A further increase in Se leads again to <lb/>an increase in the Sn concentration. This is at first glance not <lb/>intuitive since a higher Se overpressure should enhance the <lb/>formation of SnSe and therefore inhibit the Sn incorporation. <lb/>In order to clarify this, Fig. 3 shows the temporal evolution <lb/>of the growth at T = 380°C and at a constant Se partial pres-<lb/>sure of p Se =4ϫ 10 −6 Torr ͓the largest Se pressure shown in <lb/>Fig. 2͔. It is clearly visible that the incorporation of Sn does <lb/>not start right from the beginning of the experiment but only <lb/>after some induction time. At the beginning a mixed <lb/>Cu 2−x Se/ ZnSe thin film grows. After approximately 15 min <lb/>which corresponds to roughly 300 nm, Sn can be identified <lb/>by EDX. Apparently the presence of a large amount of <lb/>Cu 2−x Se and ZnSe fosters the Sn incorporation in the film to <lb/>form CZTSe. The behavior is probably caused by a change <lb/>in the desorption rate on the ZnSe/ Cu 2−x Se grains compared <lb/>to the Mo substrate. An experiment at 360°C where only Sn <lb/>and Se are evaporated on Mo does not lead to any conden-<lb/>sation of SnSe. <lb/>One could now assume that the Cu 2−x Se and ZnSe grown <lb/>during the first 15 min is consumed and a homogeneous <lb/>CZTSe film results. However this is not the case. At 380°C <lb/>the diffusion coefficient of ZnSe is too small and as a con-<lb/>sequence a thin ZnSe secondary phase remains at the Mo/ <lb/>CZTSe interface ͑confirmed by cross sectional SEM map-<lb/>ping, secondary ion mass spectrometry ͑SIMS͒, and Raman <lb/>measurements͒. The diffusion of Cu 2−x Se is already large <lb/>enough since no Cu related secondary phase could be found <lb/>at the back of the absorber. <lb/>From the previous discussion we are now able to explain <lb/>the remaining open questions in the temperature dependent <lb/>series ͓cf. Fig. 1͔. The increased Zn concentration when re-<lb/>ducing the film thickness arises from the ZnSe at the back of <lb/>the film as depicted in Fig. 3. The loss of Zn at 515°C is <lb/>also clear from the above discussion since the supersatura-<lb/>tion of Se decreases with increasing temperature which at a <lb/>certain point reduces the Zn incorporation. <lb/>We conclude that a simple coevaporation process at tem-<lb/>peratures higher then 350°C leads to Zn and Sn losses <lb/>which depend strongly on the Se partial pressure. The com-<lb/>plicated reactions lead to secondary phases and an accurate <lb/>control of the stoichiometry is difficult. <lb/></body>
