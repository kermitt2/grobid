			<front>Abstract (193 words) <lb/>MicroRNAs are potent post-transcriptional regulators involved in all hallmarks of cancer. <lb/>Mir-196a is transcribed from two loci and has been implicated in a wide range of <lb/>developmental and pathogenic processes, with targets including Hox, Fox, Cdk inhibitors and <lb/>annexins. Genetic variants and altered expression of miR196a are associated with risk and <lb/>progression of multiple cancers including breast cancer, however little is known about the <lb/>regulation of the genes encoding this miRNA, nor the impact of variants therein. Here we <lb/>demonstrate that MIR196A displays complex and dynamic expression patterns, in part <lb/>controlled by long range transcriptional regulation between promoter and enhancer elements <lb/>bound by ERα. Expression of this miRNA is significantly increased in models of hormone <lb/>receptor positive disease resistance. The expression of MIR196A also proves to be a robust <lb/>prognostic factor for patients with advanced and post-menopausal ER+ disease. This work <lb/>sheds light on the normal and abnormal regulation of MIR196A and provides a novel <lb/>stratification method for therapeutically resistant breast cancer. <lb/></front>

			<body>Introduction <lb/>MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression <lb/>(1). MicroRNAs have been implicated in many disease, ranging from rare inherited <lb/>syndromes arising from germline mutations in MiRNA genes through cancers arising from an <lb/>accumulation of germline and somatic mutations and epigenetic deregulation (2). Research <lb/>into the biology and pathology of these molecules has led to the identification of clinically <lb/>useful genetic and epigenetic biomarkers and novel therapeutic agents, often based on <lb/>antagomiR technology, that have shown promise in the control of disease symptoms and <lb/>progression (3). <lb/>MicroRNA-196A (miR-196a, MIR196A) is transcribed in two genomic locations, the HOXC <lb/>(Chr12 in humans, gene MIR196A2) and HOXB (Chr17 in humans, gene MIR196A1) loci, <lb/>downstream of HOXC10 and upstream of HOXB9 respectively. It has been strongly <lb/>implicated in a range of cancers, primarily as an oncogene. For example, MIR196A is <lb/>overexpressed in breast tumours (4), and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, <lb/>rs116149130) within the MIR196A2 gene is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer <lb/>(5). MIR196A has been shown to target the 3&apos; UTR of Annexin-1 (ANXA1), an important <lb/>mediator of apoptosis in various pathways (6), in response to the pro-angiogenic vascular <lb/>endothelium growth factor (VEGF), leading to alterations in angiogenesis. A separate study <lb/>demonstrated that MIR196A could increase growth, migration and invasion of a non-small <lb/>cell lung cancer cell line through direct targeting of HOXA5 (7). Two studies have recently <lb/>shown that MIR196A can directly influence the cell cycle by targeting p27/Kip1, an inhibitor <lb/>of cell cycle progression, to dramatically increase growth and pro-oncogenic features of <lb/></body>

			<body>cancer cell lines (8, 9). Despite the clear importance on miR-196a in cancer, its <lb/>transcriptional regulation remains poorly understood. <lb/>Transcriptional regulation is a complex multi-faceted biological process that is significantly <lb/>altered in cancer. MicroRNA genes are regulated transcriptionally in a similar manner to <lb/>protein coding and long non-coding RNA genes. Promoters mostly lie upstream (within 10kb <lb/>of the mature miRNA), contain a CpG island and in an active state when the miRNAs are <lb/>transcribed by RNA Pol II are enriched for H3K4me3 and lack H3K27me3 similar to protein <lb/>coding genes (10, 11). Taken together, these data indicate that potential promoters for <lb/>miRNAs can be identified in a similar manner to methods for protein coding genes. Several <lb/>instances of miRNA regulation by enhancers have been described, but this area is very much <lb/>in its infancy (12, 13). <lb/>In this study, we aimed to characterise the expression landscape of MIR196A including <lb/>factors regulating its expression and explore potential roles of regulatory elements and factors <lb/>in breast cancer prognostication. <lb/></body>

			<body>Results <lb/>MIR196A expression correlates with HOXC genes in breast cancer <lb/>Several HOXC protein coding and non-coding genes have shown associations with breast <lb/>cancer progression. We first identified expression patterns of HOXC genes in breast cancers <lb/>(Supp Figure 1). These data indicate that MIR196A expression highly correlates to HOXC <lb/>genes, particularly HOXC10. <lb/>Next we investigated whether these associations are also observed in normal cells of the <lb/>human breast. The association between MIR196A expression and HOXC genes is more <lb/>limited, observed most strongly with HOXC11 and HOXC10, the genes surrounding the <lb/>MIR196A gene (Supp Figure 2A). MIR196A appears to be mostly expressed within the basal <lb/>stem-cell (BSC) derived cells, whilst much lower in expression of the more differentiated cell <lb/>types (Supp Figure 2B). <lb/>MIR196A expression is regulated by oestrogen <lb/>We and others have previously demonstrated regulation of HOXC genes by oestrogen in <lb/>breast cancer (14-18). Given that MIR196A expression strongly correlates with expression of <lb/>HOXC protein coding genes in breast cancer (Supp Figure 1), we sought to determine if <lb/>oestrogen also regulates MIR196A2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) for RNA <lb/>polymerase II demonstrates that polymerase binding in the region surrounding the HOXC10 <lb/></body>

			<page>6 <lb/></page>

			<body>gene and MIR196A gene is dependent on oestrogen in MCF7 cells and is repressed with both <lb/>tamoxifen or fulvestrant treatment (Figure 1A). Global-run-on sequencing (GRO-Seq) is able <lb/>to measure nascent RNA, assessing changes in transcription with high sensitivity. Analysis of <lb/>MCF7 GRO-Seq data clearly indicates a dramatic increase in RNA production in the <lb/>genomic region surrounding MIR196A2, peaking at 40 mins following addition of oestradiol <lb/>(E2) (Figure 1B). This increase in RNA production from the HOXC locus was validated with <lb/>qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq from MCF7 cells following addition of E2 (Figures 1C and D). <lb/>These data clearly indicate an increase in precursor miRNA from MIR196A2 but not <lb/>MIR196A1 in response to E2. Taken together this suggests that MIR196A2 is transcriptionally <lb/>regulated by oestrogen. <lb/>Transcriptional regulation of miR196A <lb/>To identify the structural elements associated with the transcriptional regulation of MIR196A, <lb/>histone methylation patterns in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line were assessed. This analysis <lb/>uncovered putative promoter elements upstream of MIR196A including a shared promoter <lb/>with HOXC10 (Figure 1A). <lb/>Given that MIR196A expression is regulated by oestrogen we hypothesized that its <lb/>transcription may be controlled by the oestrogen receptor (ER). Using publically available <lb/>datasets we established that oestrogen mediated upregulation of miR-196A expression is <lb/>accompanied by binding of ERα and its pioneer factor FOXA1 to two putative promoter <lb/>regions, putative promoters 1 and 3 (PP1 and PP3), upstream of the miR196A2 transcription <lb/>start site (Figure 1B). <lb/></body>

			<page>7 <lb/></page>

			<body>Upon cloning of these putative promoter sites into luciferase reporter vectors where PP1 and <lb/>also PP2; modestly; increases luciferase gene transcription (Figure 1E), with the most active <lb/>promoter in MCF7 cells, PP1 (HOXC10 promoter). <lb/>Given that ERα often binds to distal enhancer elements to exert its function, we examined the <lb/>hypothesis that MIR196A2 is controlled by long-range transcriptional regulation, mediated by <lb/>ERα tethered gene looping. Using ChIA-PET (Chromatin Interact Analysis by Paired End <lb/>Tags) genome-wide chromatin interactions that immunoprecipitate with either ERα or RNA <lb/>Polymerase II (correlative with active promoters and enhancers), we identified two major <lb/>sites of interaction with the MIR196A2 promoters (Figure 2A). One of these is a previously <lb/>identified HOTAIR enhancer (HOTAIR distal enhancer, HDE (15)) and the other a novel <lb/>interacting partner (MIR196A2-Enhancer, mE). Chromosome conformation capture (3C) <lb/>digestion of the HOXC genomic locus digests the MIR196A2 region into two fragments. 3C-<lb/>qPCR demonstrates that both enhancer elements physically interact with each of the two <lb/>MIR196A2/HOXC10 promoter region (Figure 2B). Cloning of these fragments downstream <lb/>of the putative promoter luciferase reporters clearly demonstrates significant augmentation of <lb/>transcription for both the PP1 and PP2, with HDE appearing to be the most active in MCF7 <lb/>cells (Figure 2C). <lb/>Interestingly, a previous study (5) identified a SNP and an upstream CpG island associated <lb/>with a decrease in breast cancer risk. This SNP lies within the MIR196A2 gene and the CpG <lb/>island (CpG_Hoffman) is immediately upstream, falling into the 3&apos; end of the PP3. Analysis <lb/>of DNA methylation reveals that this CpG island is mostly methylated in non-malignant <lb/></body>

			<body>MCF10A and cancerous MCF7 cells, whilst unmethylated in human mammary epithelial <lb/>cells (HMEC) (Figure 1A). <lb/>MIR196A is differentially expressed in breast cancer <lb/>Given that MIR196A is regulated by ERα, we investigated its expression patterns in relation <lb/>to commonly utilised molecular markers of breast tumours (Figure 3A). This analysis <lb/>identified four distinct clusters of MIR196A expression (Clusters 1-4). Interestingly clusters 1 <lb/>and 3 show a strong correlation to expression of hormone receptors (HR) (AR, ERα, PGR, <lb/>HER2) and HR cofactors (Figure 3B). In contrast, clusters 2 and 4 have significant negative <lb/>correlation to expression of ERα, PGR, FOXA1 and GATA3, whilst associating with EGFR <lb/>and HER2. This expression is further defined by the PAM50 intrinsic subtypes where <lb/>MIR196A is strongly expressed in the HER2 subtype, whist in the luminal A and B subtypes <lb/>expression is very dynamic (Figure 3C). <lb/>MIR196A is a biomarker of breast cancer progression <lb/>To further explore the expression of MIR196A in breast cancer, we utilised expression data <lb/>from the METABRIC cohort of breast tumours. Expression analysis of this miRNA indicate <lb/>that it is significantly over-expressed in breast tumours compared to normal adjacent tissue <lb/>and over-expression is associated with an increase in tumour stage (Figure 4A and 4B). <lb/>Interestingly, high expression of MIR196A is associated with a poor survival in estrogen <lb/></body>

			<body>receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, whilst high expression associates with a better <lb/>outcome in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Figure 4C and D). <lb/>MIR196A is a prognostic biomarker in advanced ER+ disease <lb/>Using MIR196A expression, overall survival of ER+ tumours responding to both hormone <lb/>therapy (HT) and chemotherapy (CT) was stratified (Figure 5A). Women with low MIR196A <lb/>expression had exhibited a high rate of survival (&gt;95% at 10 years), whilst most women <lb/>within the high expression group died within 17 years (61% at 10 years). <lb/>Given that MIR196A is regulated in part by oestrogen, and the disparity in prognostication of <lb/>ER+ and TNBC, we investigated the effects of menopause on the stratification of survival for <lb/>ER+ women. The effects of menopause on the human breast are largely unknown, however <lb/>serum levels of oestrogen and progesterone dramatically reduce post menopause. In pre-<lb/>menopausal women, high expression of MIR196A is associated with a good outcome in ER+ <lb/>disease (Table 1). Multivariate analysis demonstrates that MIR196A is one of the few <lb/>significant biomarkers for ER+ tumours arising before menopause. In post-menopausal <lb/>women, all tested biomarkers were significant in ER+ disease, including MIR196A, however <lb/>high expression is now associated with a poor outcome. <lb/>Therapeutic resistance leads to increases in MIR196A expression <lb/></body>

			<page>10 <lb/></page>

			<body>TNBC is resistant to hormone-based therapies and HR+ disease often becomes resistant to <lb/>anti-oestrogen treatment. Using established models of HR+ disease resistance we found that <lb/>MIR196A expression is significantly increased in tamoxifen resistant MCF7 cells (TAMR) <lb/>whilst it is almost depleted in fulvestrant resistance (FASR) (Figure 5B). These expression <lb/>patterns match changes in DNA methylation to the HOXC10/MIR196A2 promoters in these <lb/>same cells (Figure 5C). For HR+ resistant tumours the only remaining therapeutic options are <lb/>radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Using RNA-Seq data for cell line models of resistance to <lb/>paclitaxel and adromycin, two common chemotherapeutics, MIR196A expression again <lb/>increases in resistant cell lines compared to the treatment sensitive cell line (Figure 5D). <lb/>Utilising ERα ChIP-Seq performed in human patients with HR+ disease, binding sites for <lb/>ERα were identified in the genomic region of MIR196A. This tumour cohort contains women <lb/>who respond to HR therapy, those who do not and metastases from resistant tumours. An <lb/>increase in ERα occupancy is seen at both enhancer and promoter regions of MIR196A in <lb/>non-responders and metastases (Figure 5E). The increased genome-wide ERα binding in the <lb/>more resistant tumours was shown by the authors to associate with changes to expression <lb/>patterns crucial for the resistant tumour to survive therapy and become resistant. <lb/></body>

			<body>Discussion <lb/>The expression of MIR196A in breast cancer is both dynamic and complex. In this paper, we <lb/>have elucidated important elements, factors and mechanisms controlling the transcriptional <lb/>regulation of MIR196A and shown that changes in this regulation are associated with breast <lb/>cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. <lb/>Previous genetic association studies have shown that SNPs within MIR196A2 confer a <lb/>reduced risk of breast cancer (5, 19, 20). Hoffman and colleagues (5) postulated that the <lb/>polymorphism located within the MIR196A2 gene reduces microRNA maturation thereby <lb/>reducing expression of the gene. They also identified that an upstream CpG island is <lb/>associated with reduced risk when hypermethylated. Here we show that this upstream CpG <lb/>island lies within the transcriptionally active region of HOXC10 and MIR196A2 as observed <lb/>through GRO-Seq. Interestingly, this CpG island is completely methylated in models of <lb/>oestrogen deprivation and fulvestrant treatment, but not in tamoxifen resistant cells. DNA <lb/>methylation is most commonly associated with repressed transcription (21), <lb/>hypermethylation of this region in a transcriptional high region may severely impair <lb/>expression. Given that various transcription factors strongly influence transcription in <lb/>endocrine resistant breast cancer, these data suggest that binding of ERα accompanied by <lb/>cofactors may be needed to maintain low methylation levels and active transcription in breast <lb/>cancer (22-26). <lb/>We have previously demonstrated that long-range regulation of HOXC genes occurs in breast <lb/>cancer and is influenced by ERα and its associated cofactors (15). HOX gene expression is <lb/></body>

			<page>12 <lb/></page>

			<body>tightly controlled in a spatiotemporal manner to ensure proper axial formation along the <lb/>anterior-posterior axis (27). Within the cell types of the human breast, HOX gene expression <lb/>appears dynamic and the association between MIR196A and HOXC genes is not significant. <lb/>The strong correlation in expression of all HOXC genes in breast tumours with MIR196A is in <lb/>stark contrast to expression in normal tissues. Several instances have been described <lb/>regarding the influence of multiple distal enhancers on gene expression, such as the well <lb/>characterised locus-control-region (LCR) of the Beta-globin genes or the c-Myc enhancers <lb/>active across multiple cancer types (28-31). Given the extensive interactions between this <lb/>locus and its adjacent gene desert, we hypothesise that a consorted effort of multiple <lb/>enhancers is responsible for the overexpression of these genes in cancer possibly driven by <lb/>extensive binding and activity of ERα. To explore this hypothesis a high resolution <lb/>chromatin interaction analysis of this region in breast cancer cells would be required, such as <lb/>5C (32) or NG Capture-C (33), coupled with ERα ChIP-Seq and ChIA-PET (34). <lb/>Whilst this manuscript was in preparation new data has come to light which corroborates our <lb/>conclusions. Jiang et al (35) demonstrate that the mature MIR196A transcript positively <lb/>responds to oestrogen stimulation in MCF7 cells, and this is mediated by upstream ERα <lb/>binding. This binding peak falls within PP3. Whilst we show that PP3 is not able to increase <lb/>luciferase expression in a luciferase reporter assay, the binding of ERα may be important for <lb/>the activity of the HOXC10 and MIR196A2 promoters. <lb/>Using hierarchical clustering of breast tumour RNA-Seq data, we observed two distinct <lb/>expression patterns associated with MIR196A expression. Data presented here suggests that <lb/>the two loci encoding for this miRNA contribute greatly to the complexity of its expression. <lb/>It is currently unclear how dual-encoded miRs are regulated of which many exist (36). <lb/></body>

			<page>13 <lb/></page>

			<body>Interestingly, DNA methylation at several sites within the HOXC locus negatively correlates <lb/>with the expression of this miRNA, supporting the notion of DNA methylation as a <lb/>repressive epigenetic modification in this context (21). <lb/>High expression of MIR196A is a biomarker of poor prognosis in ER+ tumours, especially in <lb/>those patients resistant to therapy. Expression of MIR196A increases in response to tamoxifen <lb/>and chemotherapeutic agents in oestrogen responsive MCF7 cells. This increase in <lb/>expression is associated with loss of DNA methylation within the promoter regions of the <lb/>miRNA. In poor responders with ER+ tumours, HOXC enhancer elements appear to more <lb/>readily bind the ER. These data raise the possibility that the pathway to resistance to therapy <lb/>in ER+ tumours involves the de-repression and over-activation of promoter and enhancer <lb/>elements. This is commonly seen throughout cancer (37-39), with suggestions that enhancer <lb/>disruption can revert cells to a non-terminally-differentiated state a common hallmark of <lb/>tumourigenesis. HOX genes are essential in embryonic development, these genes would be a <lb/>valuable asset for any tumour cell to use to sustain a stem-cell like state (40, 41). <lb/>Breast cancer incidence and relative subtype changes after menopause (42, 43). In women <lb/>younger than 45, luminal breast tumours account for 33-44% (44, 45). This increases to 70-<lb/>72% in women older than 65. In contrast, basal-like tumours are more common in younger <lb/>women, suggesting a switch or evolution in the factors driving cancer following menopause, <lb/>most likely related to the decline in oestrogen production. It is then interesting to note that <lb/>higher expression of MIR196A associates with good outcome in pre-menopausal women with <lb/>ER+ tumours, and a poor outcome of ER+ tumours following menopause. Given the strong <lb/>involvement of HOX genes in development, we hypothesise that there is a change in the <lb/></body>

			<page>14 <lb/></page>

			<body>regulation and expression of these genes through and following menopause, which in turn <lb/>impacts their contribution to the development of certain breast cancer subtypes. <lb/>MIR196A is a dynamically expressed miRNA in both normal mammary cells and breast <lb/>tumours. This miRNA is a possible biomarker for the progression of breast tumour to <lb/>becoming resistant to therapy. Future studies should aim to uncover the purpose of increase <lb/>MIR196A expression and if it is required for development of resistance alone or in <lb/>combination with other HOXC genes. <lb/></body>

MCF7, Tamoxifen-resistant (TAMR), Fulvestrant-resistant (FASR), and <lb/>oestrogen-deprived (MCF7x) cells were cultured as described (46-48). All cell lines were <lb/>cultured for less than 6 months after authentication by short-tandem repeat (STR) profiling <lb/>(Cell Bank, Australia). <lb/>Cloning and reporter assays <lb/>All PCR products for luciferase reporter assays were ligated into Invitrogen&apos;s pCR-Blunt <lb/>plasmid using T4 DNA Ligase, at 4 0 C overnight. MIR196A enhancers and promoters were <lb/>digested from pCR-Blunt and cloned into the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic. <lb/>Enhancers were cloned into the BamHI/SalI site whilst promoters were cloned into the <lb/>multiple cloning site immediately upstream of the luciferase gene. See Supplementary Table1 <lb/>for primers. <lb/>MCF7 cells were transfected in antibiotic free media with 500 ng of modified pGL3 reporter <lb/>constructs, 20 ng of pRL-TK (Renilla transfection control) and with 0.5μL of Lipofectamine <lb/>3000 (Life Technologies, L3000-008). 48 hours post transfection luciferase readings were <lb/>measured using a DTX-880 luminometer and Dual-Glo Stop and Glo luciferase reporter kit <lb/>(Promega, E2920), following the manufacturer&apos;s recommended protocol. <lb/></body>
