			<body>There is an increasing interest to the physics of geometrically frustrated systems. One <lb/>of the most remarkable examples is the observation of bulk superconductivity in pyrochlore <lb/>oxide KOs 2 O 6 with the transition temperature T c ≃ 9.6 K [1]. It was the second compound <lb/>with pyrochlore structure, after CdRe O 7 (T c ≃ 1 K) [2, 3], where superconductivity was <lb/>observed. Recently, the third and the forth pyrochlore superconductors, namely RbOs O 6 <lb/>(T c ≃ 6.3 K) [4, 5, 6, 7] and CsOs O 6 (T c ≃ 3.3 K) [8] were announced. The nature of <lb/>the pairing mechanism in these pyrochlore compounds is still an open question. CdRe 2 O 7 <lb/>is suggested to be a weak-coupling BCS superconductor [9] without nodes in the supercon-<lb/>ducting gap [9, 10]. Specific heat measurements performed on RbOs O 6 [5] are consistent <lb/>with BCS type of behaviour. On the other hand, Hiroi et al. [4] and Koda et al. [11] pointed <lb/>to an unconventional mechanism of superconductivity in KOs O 6 and suggested that the <lb/>superconducting order parameter is anisotropic [11]. <lb/>Magnetic field penetration depth λ and high-pressure studies traditionally play an impor-<lb/>tant role in superconductivity. The temperature dependence of λ reflects the quasiparticle <lb/>density of states available for thermal excitations and therefore probes the superconducting <lb/>gap structure. In addition, the shape of λ(T ) can provide relevant information about the <lb/>superconducting mechanism. High-pressure experiments, if a high pressure effect on T c is <lb/>observed, are a good indication that higher values of T c in similar compounds may be ob-<lb/>tained by &quot;chemical&quot; pressure (by changing the appropriate ion to its chemical equivalent <lb/>with different ion size). <lb/>In this letter we report studies of the hydrostatic pressure effect on the superconducting <lb/>temperature T c and the magnetic field penetration depth λ in the pyrochlore superconductor <lb/>RbOs 2 O 6 . The value of λ extrapolated to zero temperature is estimated to be in the range <lb/>nm to 520 nm. The behavior of λ(T ) indicates that RbOs O 6 is most probably a s-wave <lb/>weak-coupled BCS superconductor within the adiabatic limit. However, d-wave type of <lb/>pairing symmetry is not completely excluded. The transition temperature increases with <lb/>increasing pressure with the slope dT c /dp = 0.090(1) K/kbar. This effect can be explained <lb/>by a substantial increase of the electron-phonon coupling constant λ el−ph with pressure. <lb/>Details of the sample preparation for RbOs O 6 can be found elsewhere [5, 6]. In the <lb/>current work, we performed DC-magnetization measurements. In this technique, the critical <lb/>temperature is directly obtained from the magnetization curve. Following the classical work <lb/></body>

			<body>of Shoenberg [12], for fine powders with known grain sizes the magnetic penetration depth <lb/>can be calculated from the Meissner fraction. For this reason the RbOs 2 O 6 powder sample <lb/>was ground. The grain size distribution was then determined by analyzing SEM (scanning <lb/>electron microscope) photographs. The measured particle radius distribution N(R) and the <lb/>distribution of the volume fraction ∼ N(R)R 3 are shown in Fig. 1. <lb/>2 <lb/>4 <lb/>6 <lb/>8 <lb/>10 <lb/>0 <lb/>5 <lb/>10 <lb/>15 <lb/>0 2 4 6 <lb/>1 <lb/>10 <lb/>100 <lb/>1000 <lb/>N R <lb/>3 <lb/>x10 <lb/>3 <lb/>( m <lb/>) <lb/>R ( m) <lb/>R ( m) <lb/>number of particles (N) <lb/>FIG. 1: The volume fraction distribution N (R)R 3 in the RbOs 2 O 6 powder determined from the <lb/>SEM photographs.

The sample was mixed <lb/>with Fluorient FC77 (pressure transmitting medium) with a sample to liquid volume ratio <lb/>of approximately 1/6. With this cell hydrostatic pressures up to 12 kbar can be achieved <lb/>[13]. The pressure was taken from a separate calibration set of magnetization experiments <lb/>where a small piece of In [T c (0) = 3.4 K] with known T c (p) dependence was added to the <lb/>sample and both T c of In and RbOs O 6 were recorded. <lb/>The field-cooled (FC) magnetization measurements were performed with a SQUID mag-<lb/>netometer in a field of 0.5 mT at temperatures ranging from 1.75 K to 10 K. The absence of <lb/>weak links between grains was confirmed by the linear magnetic field dependence of the FC <lb/>magnetization, measured at 0.25 mT, 0.5 mT and 1.0 mT for each pressure at T = 1.75 K. <lb/>The Meissner fraction f was calculated from the mass of the samples, their x-ray density, <lb/>and assuming spherical grains. The volume of the superconducting fraction was taken 77 % <lb/>in accordance with the heat capacity measurements performed with this sample [5]. <lb/>The temperature dependence of the penetration depth λ was calculated from the mea-<lb/>sured f (T ) by using the Shoenberg formula [12] modified for the known grain size distribution <lb/>[14]: <lb/>f (T ) = <lb/>∞ <lb/>0 <lb/>− <lb/>3λ(T ) <lb/>R <lb/>coth <lb/>R <lb/>λ(T ) <lb/>+ <lb/>3λ 2 (T ) <lb/>R <lb/>g(R)dR/ <lb/>∞ <lb/>0 <lb/>g(R)dR . <lb/>(1) <lb/>Here g(R) = N(R)R 3 , and N(R) is the grain size distribution (see Fig. 1). By solving <lb/>this nonlinear equation, λ for each value of f was extracted, and then the set of λ(T, p) <lb/>dependences was reconstructed. The resulting temperature dependence λ −2 (T, 0) at ambient <lb/>pressure is shown in Fig. 2. Reconstructed data were fitted with different models. The <lb/>dotted line represents the fit with the two-fluid model λ −2 (T )/λ −2 (0) = 1 − (T /T c ) 4 (T c = <lb/>5.91(2) K, λ(0) = 520(5) nm) which corresponds to a strong coupled BCS superconductor. <lb/>In this paragraph, the errors in parameters are transfered from the &quot;noise&quot; of magnetization <lb/>measurements and do not include systematic errors which are discussed later. The solid line <lb/>is the fit (T c = 6.16(1) K, λ(0) = 490(1) nm) with the tabulated Mülhschlegel data [15] <lb/>calculated for a weak coupled s-wave BCS superconductor. It is seen that the weak coupling <lb/>BCS behavior describes the experimental data rather well, below 5.9 K the deviation of the <lb/>experimental points from the theoretical BCS curve does not exceed 2%. For comparison <lb/></body>

			<body>with literature, we also performed a fit with the empirical power law λ −2 (T )/λ −2 (0) = 1 − <lb/>(T /T c ) n [16] with free n (dashed line in Fig. 2). The fit yields T c = 6.17(1), λ(0) = 456(3) nm, <lb/>and n = 1.80(3). In [11] an observation of n ≃ 2 was taken as an argument in favor of d-<lb/>wave type of pairing. To distinguish between weak coupling BCS and d-wave models one <lb/>has to know λ −2 (T ) at low temperatures where they exhibit completely different behavior. <lb/>Unfortunately, these data are not available yet. That is why, from the current experimental <lb/>data, we can not exclude completely the possibility of d x 2 −y 2 type of pairing in RbOs 2 O 6 . <lb/>We plan to perform low temperature measurements in the nearest future. <lb/>To estimate the error in the absolute value of λ(0) introduced by the uncertainty in <lb/>the grain-size distribution we performed reconstructions with two &quot;extreme&quot; conditions. <lb/>For the first we took the grain-size distribution in the form N − (R) = N(R) − N(R), <lb/>for the second we took N + (R) = N(R) + N(R). Appropriate λ −2 (T ) dependences for <lb/>N + (R), N(R) and N − (R) are shown in the insert of Fig. 2. The fit with the weak-coupling <lb/>BCS model yields 440(1) nm for the lowest and 520(1) nm for the highest values of λ(0). <lb/>Bearing in mind the absence of the experimental data at low temperatures and, as a result, <lb/>the model dependent (power law vs weak-coupling) error in λ(0) extrapolation procedure <lb/>(which introduces additional uncertainty of about 30 nm) we can estimate the interval for <lb/>λ(0) ranging from 410 nm to 520 nm. To diminish this uncertainty more direct measurements <lb/>(e.g. µSR) are planed. <lb/>As a next step we performed pressure effect (PE) measurements on T c and λ. As it was <lb/>already mentioned, the procedure of the λ −2 (T ) reconstruction is sensitive to the grain-size <lb/>distribution. In addition it is also very sensitive to the value of the superconducting fraction, <lb/>which was fixed from heat capacity measurements. The good thing here is that we study <lb/>relative effects measured with the same sample in the same pressure cell, where most of the <lb/>systematic errors are eliminated. The main systematic error for such measurements comes <lb/>from misalignments of the experimental setup after the cell was removed from the SQUID <lb/>magnetometer and put back again. We checked this procedure with a set of measurements <lb/>at constant pressure. The systematic scattering of the magnetization data is of about 0.5%, <lb/>giving a relative error in λ −2 (T ) of about 2%. <lb/>Figure 3 shows the λ −2 vs T dependences for p =0.0 kbar and 9.98 kbar. The transition <lb/>temperature increases almost by 1 K at 9.98 kbar, whereas there is practically no change <lb/></body>

(1). Solid lines represent fits with the weak-coupling BCS model. <lb/>In RbOs 2 O 6 an estimate of the coherence length ξ, derived from the second critical field <lb/>H c2 (0), gives ξ ≃ 7.4 nm [5]. Under the assumption that l has the same order of magnitude <lb/>as in the pyrochlore superconductor Cd Re 2 O 7 (l ∼ 20 − 70 nm [9]), RbOs 2 O 6 may be <lb/>considered as a superconductor in the clean limit l ≫ ξ. In this case λ obeys the relation: <lb/>λ ∝ n s /m * , <lb/>(2) <lb/>where n s is the superconducting charge carrier density, and m * is the effective mass of the <lb/>supercarriers. Therefore, the absence of a PE on λ(0) suggests that either both quantities <lb/>

			n s and m * are pressure independent or the pressure shifts of n s and m * cancel each other. <lb/>While we cannot rule out completely the second scenario, we think that the the first one is <lb/>more likely. The conventional phonon-mediated theory of superconductivity is based on the <lb/>Migdal adiabatic approximation in which the effective supercarrier mass m * is independent <lb/>of the lattice degrees of freedom. Thus, the absence of a PE on λ(0) [see Fig 4(a)] suggests <lb/>that RbOs 2 O 6 may be considered as an adiabatic BCS superconductor. Note that the same <lb/>effect (absence of a PE on λ) was observed recently in MgB which is accepted to be a purely <lb/>phonon mediated superconductor [17]. <lb/>The pressure dependence of the critical temperature is shown in Fig. 4(b). The linear <lb/>fit yields dT c /dp = 0.090(1) K/kbar. The linear increase of T c with pressure observed in <lb/>RbOs 2 O 6 is quite unusual. For the majority of BCS-type superconductors (including MgB ) <lb/>T c decreases with increasing pressure. For conventional superconductors the pressure shift <lb/>of T c can be derived as [18, 19] <lb/>d ln T c <lb/>dp <lb/>= <lb/>d ln ω <lb/>dp <lb/>+ <lb/>1.23λ el−ph <lb/>(λ el−ph − 0.11) 2 <lb/>d ln λ el−ph <lb/>dp <lb/>, <lb/>(3) <lb/>where ω is the average phonon frequency, and λ el−ph is the electron-phonon coupling <lb/>constant. There are two contributions to the pressure shift of T c : from the phonon system <lb/>[d ln ω /dp] and from the coupling between electron and phonon subsystems [d ln λ el−ph /dp]. <lb/>The effect of pressure on the phonon spectra usually results in an increase of the average <lb/>phonon frequency, and the first term in Eq. (3) is generally positive. An estimate of a <lb/>typical range of d ω /dp = −γ/B (where γ = d ln ω /d ln V is the Grüneisen parameter, V <lb/>is the volume, and B is the bulk modulus) in conventional superconductors gives d ω /dp ≈ <lb/>0.01% − 0.5% per kbar [20, 21]. The pressure shift of T c found in our study (d ln T c /dp ≃ <lb/>1.5%/kbar) is much bigger than the possible contribution form the first term in Eq. (3). <lb/>Therefore, our results suggest a substantial increase of λ el−ph with pressure. Alternatively, <lb/>the positive pressure effect on T c can be explained by a sort of charge ordering, resulting in <lb/>the disproportionation of the Os tetrahedra [22]. <lb/>In conclusion, we performed magnetization measurements in the newly discovered super-<lb/>conductor RbOs 2 O 6 under hydrostatic pressure. The absolute value of λ at zero tempera-<lb/>ture and ambient pressure is estimated to be in the range 410-520 nm. The temperature <lb/>dependence of the magnetic penetration depth λ is consistent with that expected for a weak-<lb/>coupled s-wave BCS superconductor. However, to rule out completely d-wave symmetry, <lb/></body>

			<page>8 <lb/></page>

			<body>additional low temperatures measurements are required. A pronounced and positive pres-<lb/>sure effect on T c with dT c /dp = 0.090(1) K/kbar was observed, in contrast to the negative <lb/>pressure shift generally detected in conventional superconductors. This finding can be ex-<lb/>plained within the framework of BCS theory under the assumption that the electron-phonon <lb/>coupling constant λ el−ph increases with pressure. The absence (within the experimental un-<lb/>certainties) of the pressure effect on λ suggests that RbOs 2 O 6 is an adiabatic BCS-type <lb/>superconductor. <lb/></body>
