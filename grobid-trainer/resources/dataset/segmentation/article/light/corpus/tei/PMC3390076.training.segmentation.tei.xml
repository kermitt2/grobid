Methods Data of 189 patients with acute anterior MI who had a <lb/>primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the first 12 h from the onset of symptoms between January 2004 and December 2008 <lb/>were retrospective analyzed. Left anterior descending arteries (LAD) of all patients were occluded. LADs were reopened with primary PCI. <lb/>According to the collateral circulation, all patients were classified to two groups: no collateral group (n = 111), patients without angiographic <lb/>collateral filling of LAD or side branches (collateral index 0) and collateral group (n = 78), and patients with angiographic collateral filling of <lb/>LAD or side branches (collateral index 1, 2 or 3). At one year&apos;s follow-up, the occurrence of death, reinfarction, stent thrombosis (ST), target <lb/>vessel revascularization and readmission because of heart failure were observed. Results At one year, the mortality was lower in patients <lb/>with collateral circulation compared with those without collateral circulation (1% vs. 8%, P = 0.049), whereas there were no differences in <lb/>the occurrence of reinfarction, ST, target vessel revascularization and readmission because of heart failure. The occurrence of composite of <lb/>endpoint was lower in patients with collateral circulation compared with those without collateral circulation (12% vs. 26%; P = 0.014). <lb/>Conclusions Pre-exist collateral circulation may prefigure the satisfactory prognosis to the patients with acute anterior MI after primary <lb/>PCI in the first 12 h of MI onset. <lb/>J Geriatr Cardiol 2011; 8: 93−98. doi: 10.3724/SP.J.1263.2011.00093 <lb/>Keywords: collateral circulation; myocardial infarction; mortality; left anterior descending artery <lb/></front>

			<body>1 Introduction <lb/>Anterior infarcts often leads to unsatisfactory prognosis <lb/>because of impaired left ventricular function. Anterior <lb/>infarcts are associated with a larger enzymatic infarct size <lb/>and greater reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction <lb/>(LVEF) compared with nonanterior infarcts. [1] Reperfusion <lb/>of the occluded coronary artery early after acute myocardial <lb/>infarction (AMI) limits infarct size, improvers LVEF, and <lb/>enhances survival. [2] In some patients, collateral circulations <lb/>will emerge shortly after the coronary arteries&apos; occlusion. It <lb/>is unknown what is the role of collateral circulation in <lb/>prognosis of the patients with anterior AMI after percutaneous <lb/>coronary intervention (PCI). The main purpose of the <lb/>present study was to find the effect of collateral circulation <lb/>on patients&apos; outcome in the patients with anterior AMI who <lb/></body>

			<body>thrombolysis (rescue PCI), and, patients with previous <lb/>anterior infarction were excluded. The patients in this study <lb/>were classified into two groups: no collateral group, patients <lb/>without angiographic collateral filling of LAD or side <lb/>branches (collateral index 0); collateral group, patients with <lb/>angiographic collateral filling of LAD or side branches <lb/>(collateral index 1, 2 or 3). [3] <lb/>2.2 Coronary angiography and primary angioplasty <lb/>Patients orally received 600 mg clopidogrel and 300 mg <lb/>aspirin as soon as possible unless there was a known allergy. <lb/>Coronary angiography and primary PCI were performed in <lb/>the first 12 h from the onset of symptoms of AMI. Once the <lb/>radial or femoral artery was catheterized, 5000 IU of heparin <lb/>was administered with additional boluses of 2000 IU if <lb/>needed to achieve an activated clotting time of 250 s to 350 s. <lb/>Coronary arteriograms were obtained in at least two <lb/>projections. Flow in the LAD was determined before and <lb/>after primary PCI and graded as described in the TIMI <lb/>trial. [4] The LAD occlusion was considered proximal if it <lb/>was located before the origin of the first well developed <lb/>septal branch, distal if it was located after the origin of the <lb/>third diagonal branch and mid if located between these <lb/>limits. [5] Primary PCI was performed with conventional <lb/>catheter balloon technique. [6] Stents were used routinely in <lb/>the target lesion. The policy was to perform angioplasty <lb/>only to the infarct-related artery, but in exceptional cases <lb/>additional angioplasty to another vessel was performed <lb/>because of compromised hemodynamic status. Intraaortic <lb/>balloon pumping was used in patients with hemodynamic <lb/>instability or established cardiogenic shock. The primary <lb/>PCI was considered successful when flow in the infarct-<lb/>related artery at the end of the procedure was TIMI grade 3 <lb/>and the residual stenosis was less than 30%. <lb/>Before March 2007, most of patients were implanted <lb/>with bare-metal stents (BMS) and since then drug-eluting <lb/>stent (DES) was extensively used. Postinterventional <lb/>antiplatelet therapy consisted of clopidogrel (150 mg/d for <lb/>two weeks, continued for three months for BMS or one year <lb/>for DES) and aspirin (300 mg/d for one month and continued <lb/>indefinitely). <lb/>2.3 Coronary collateral circulation <lb/>Collateral circulation to the occluded LAD was assessed <lb/>in coronary cineangiograms by two experienced coronary <lb/>angiographers who had no knowledge of patient data. <lb/>Collateral circulation was graded by using a semiquantitative <lb/>scale from 0 to 3 (collateral index) depending on the degree <lb/>of angiographic opacification of the occluded LAD in the <lb/>best injection: 0 = no collateral circulation; 1 = collateral <lb/>filling of LAD side branches without visualization of any <lb/>epicardial segment; 2 = collateral partial filling of the <lb/>epicardial segment, and 3 = collateral filling of the complete <lb/>epicardial segment. [3] In case of noncoincidence, the <lb/>angiographers reached a consensus. <lb/>2.4 Follow-up <lb/>All patients in the study were follow-up for one year. The <lb/>occurrence of death, reinfarction, stent thrombosis (ST), <lb/>target vessel revascularization and readmission because of <lb/>heart failure were observed. The follow-up information was <lb/>obtained by a phone call at one year. Reinfarction was <lb/>defined as the recurrence of ischemic chest pain after <lb/>primary PCI of ≥ 30 min duration with ST segment <lb/>elevation of ≥ 0.1 mV over the previous ST segment in two <lb/>contiguous leads and the MB fraction of creatine kinase <lb/>(CK-MB) profile consistent with the diagnosis. ST was <lb/>defined as thrombosis in stent by angiography. Target vessel <lb/>revascularization was defined as PCI or coronary artery <lb/>bypass graft due to restenosis or reocclusion of the target <lb/>lesion in association with objective evidence of ischemia or <lb/>viable myocardium. Historical angina pectoris was defined <lb/>as typical chest pain episode(s) persisting &lt; 30 min either at <lb/>rest or with effort before 24 h before onset of AMI. <lb/>2.5 Statistical analysis <lb/>Continuous variables followed a normal distribution is <lb/>expressed as mean ± SD. For comparisons of continuous <lb/>variables between both groups the Student t test for <lb/>unpaired observations was used. We used the chi-square test <lb/>to compare categoric variables between groups unless <lb/>expected values were less than 5, in which case we used the <lb/>Fisher exact test. The Cox proportional hazards model was <lb/>used to assess the association between the composite <lb/>endpoint and coronary collateral circulation. All results <lb/>were analyzed by using a two-sided significance level of <lb/>0.05. Data analyses were performed by using the statistical <lb/>software SPSS 11.0 from SPSS Inc. (USA). <lb/>3 Results <lb/>3.1 Baseline characteristics of patients <lb/>From January 2004 to December 2008, 456 patients with <lb/>anterior wall AMI within the first 12 h of the onset of <lb/>symptoms were treated in our center by primary PCI. For <lb/>the present analysis, we selected 189 of these patients who <lb/>fulfilled the above mentioned criteria. The 267 patients who <lb/>did not fulfilled the criteria were excluded. Of the 189 <lb/>patients included, 111 (59%) did not have angiographically <lb/>visible collateral circulation to the LAD, 78 (41%) patients, <lb/></body>

The model <lb/>indentified without collateral circulation (hazard ratio[HR] <lb/>= 2.916, 95%CI: 1.291-6.586; P = 0.010) and the proximal <lb/>LAD occlusion (HR = 2.196, 95%CI: 1.073-4.492; P = <lb/>0.031) were independent predictors of one year composite <lb/>endpoint. <lb/>The occurrence of composite endpoint in patients with <lb/>collateral coronary circulation was lower than that in patient <lb/>without collateral coronary circulation in those patients <lb/>received PCI within six hours of symptoms (0/19 [0] vs. <lb/>16/53 [30.2%], P = 0.008), but not in those received PCI <lb/>between 6 to 12 h after symptoms (9/59 [15.5%] vs. 13/58 <lb/>[22.4%], P = 0.353). For patients with collateral coronary <lb/>circulation, the occurrence of composite endpoint in those <lb/>who received PCI between 6 h and 12 h after symptom <lb/>onset was lower than that in patients without collateral <lb/>coronary circulation but received PCI within six hours of <lb/>symptoms (9/59 [15.5%] vs. 16/53 [30.2%], P = 0.023). <lb/>4 Discussion <lb/>The coronary collateral circulation is an alternative <lb/>source of blood supply to a myocardium jeopardized by <lb/>abruptly occluded vessels, preventing myocardial death and <lb/>favoring myocardial recovery after reperfusion therapy. <lb/>Howerer, the functional significance of collateral circulation <lb/>in AMI has been a matter of debate for many years. [7-8] It <lb/>has been traditionally assumed that coronary arteries are <lb/>functional end arteries in the absence of stenoses, but it also <lb/>was reported that there are functional collateral vessels to <lb/>the extent in humans with angiographically normal coronary <lb/>arteries. [9] Factors that may influence the presence of <lb/>collaterals after the onset of AMI have been demonstrated in <lb/>previous clinical studies. The recruitment of collateral <lb/>circulation is affected by the presence of multivessel <lb/>disease, [10] preinfarction angina, [5] history of angina <lb/>pectoris, [11] time from onset to cardiac catheterization. [12] It <lb/>was reported that collateral circulation did not exert a <lb/>protective effect in patients who underwent primary PCI. In <lb/>that paper, the author didn&apos;t analyse the outcome of patients <lb/>with anterior AMI and only chose the patients with AMI in <lb/>the first six hours of AMI onset. [13] The patients with <lb/>LAD-related infarcts had a worse prognosis compared with <lb/>the patients with non-LAD-related infarcts because of a <lb/>lower residual LVEF. [1] So, the study for collateral <lb/>circulation to the LAD-related infarcts may be important. <lb/>In the first six hours of AMI onset, 17% of patients with <lb/>anterior AMI were found angiographic collateral circulation. [13] <lb/>In other study, collateral circulations were visible in nearly <lb/>40% of patient with AMI. [14] In the present study, collateral <lb/>circulation to the occluded LAD is found by angiography <lb/>whithin the first 12 h of AMI onset in 41% of patients with <lb/>anterior AMI. The percent of the patients with collateral <lb/>circulation in the first six hours of AMI was 24%. The <lb/>pressure-derived fractional collateral flow was measured in <lb/>70 patients with AMI onset in the first 12 h. It was found <lb/>that the left ventricular recovery after reperfused AMI was <lb/>primarily determined by pressure-derived fractional collateral <lb/>flow and was less dependent on time to reperfusion in <lb/>patients with collaterals. [15] Time to reperfusion is important <lb/>for survival with thrombolytic therapy. [16,17] Improverment <lb/>in ejection fraction was substantial with reperfusion at less <lb/>than two hours but was relatively independent of time to <lb/>reperfusion after two hours. The mortality was independent <lb/>of time to reperfusion. [18] It has been suggested that some <lb/>reasons why time to treatment may be less important with <lb/>primary PCI than thrombolytic therapy might be possible. <lb/>First, TIMI 2 to 3 flow is achieved less often with increasing <lb/>time to treatment with thrombolytic therapy. [19] In contrast, <lb/>TIMI 3 flow was achieved in a high percentage of patients <lb/>regardless of time to treatment with primary PCI. Second, in <lb/>patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, mortality rates <lb/>from myocarrdial rupture increased progressively with <lb/>increasing time to treatment.In contrast, mortality rates due <lb/>to myocardial rupture after primary PCI are very low. [20] <lb/>Third, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage after <lb/>thrombolytic therapy increased with increasing time to <lb/>treatment. [17] The occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage <lb/>with primary PCI is rare. [21] In our study, collateral circulation <lb/>was an dependent factor for the composite endpoint, and the <lb/></body>

			<body>symptom to treatment time was not an dependent factor. It <lb/>was suggested that the time to reperfusion was a crucial <lb/>factor for the prognosis of patient with AMI in the first <lb/>hours onset (possible two hours or six hours or other) and <lb/>the benefit of reperfusion would decrease after the first <lb/>hours AMI onset. The presence of collateral circulation at <lb/>this time point may improve myocardial salvage [22-23] and <lb/>prevent ventricular remodeling, [24] thereby improving <lb/>prognosis independent of coronary reperfusion therapy. [25] <lb/>In the present study, the patients with collateral coronary <lb/>circulation had better prognosis than it in the patient without <lb/>collateral coronary circulation when the patients with AMI <lb/>accepted primary PCI in the first six hours of syndrome to <lb/>treatment time. The patients with AMI with collateral <lb/>coronary circulation accepted primary PCI between 6 h and <lb/>12 h of syndrome to treatment time had a better prognosis <lb/>tendency compared with the patients without collateral <lb/>coronary circulation. The patients with collateral coronary <lb/>circulation accepting primary PCI between 6 h and 12 h of <lb/>syndrome to treatment time had better prognosis than it in <lb/>the patients without collateral coronary circulation accepting <lb/>primary PCI in the first 6 h of syndrome to treatment time. <lb/>These results suggest that finding a way to gaining the <lb/>collateral coronary circulation earlier might give a better <lb/>prognosis to the patients with AMI. It has been found that <lb/>basic fibroblast growth factor enhances collateral development, <lb/>reduces infarct size and improves cardiac function. [26] <lb/>Some potential limitations need to be addressed. First, <lb/>the sum of sample is not a larger number. Second, some <lb/>data, such as peak creatine kinase myocardial band and left <lb/>ventricular ejection fraction at one year were not collected <lb/>completely. So, the infarction area and the function of left <lb/>ventricle were not evaluated accurately. <lb/> </body>
