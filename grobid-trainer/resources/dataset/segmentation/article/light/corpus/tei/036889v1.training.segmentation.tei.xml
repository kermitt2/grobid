			<front>Abstract <lb/>Background <lb/>Low birth weight and postnatal growth restriction are the most evident <lb/>symptoms of dwarfism. Accompanying skeletal aberrations may compromise <lb/>the general condition and locomotion of affected individuals. Recently, several <lb/>paternal half sibs with low birth weight and size have been noticed in the <lb/>Fleckvieh cattle population. <lb/>Results <lb/>Affected calves were strikingly underweight at birth despite a normal gestation <lb/>length and had craniofacial abnormalities such as elongated narrow heads and <lb/>brachygnathia inferior. Despite a normal general condition, their growth <lb/>remained restricted during rearing. We genotyped 27 affected and 10,454 <lb/>unaffected animals at 44,672 SNP and performed association testing followed <lb/>by homozygosity mapping to map the growth failure to a 1.85 Mb segment on <lb/>bovine chromosome 3. Analysis of whole-genome re-sequencing data from <lb/>one affected and 289 control animals revealed a 1bp deletion <lb/>(g.15079217delC, rs723240647) in the coding region of the GON4L gene that <lb/>segregated with the dwarfism-associated haplotype. We show that the deletion <lb/>introduces intron retention and premature termination of translation, resulting in <lb/>a severely truncated protein that lacks domains that are likely essential to <lb/>normal protein function. The widespread use of an unnoticed carrier bull for <lb/>artificial insemination has resulted in a tenfold increase in the frequency of the <lb/>deleterious allele in the female population. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>A frameshift mutation in GON4L is associated with autosomal recessive <lb/>dwarfism in Fleckvieh cattle. The mutation has segregated in the population for <lb/>more than fifty years without being recognized as a genetic disorder. However, <lb/>the widespread use of an unnoticed carrier bull for artificial insemination <lb/>caused a sudden accumulation of homozygous calves with dwarfism. Our <lb/>findings provide the basis for genome-based mating strategies to avoid the <lb/></front>

			<body>Background <lb/>Bovine stature is a prototypical complex trait that is controlled by a few loci with <lb/>large effects and numerous loci with small effects. Genome-wide association <lb/>studies using dense molecular markers revealed several quantitative trait loci <lb/>(QTL) for growth-related traits in cattle [1],[2],[3]. The identified QTL account <lb/>for a reasonable fraction of the phenotypic variation of bovine height [2],[4]. <lb/>Sequence variants associated with mature height may also affect the size and <lb/>weight of newborn calves [2],[3],[5],. <lb/>Birth size and weight varies between breeds, parities and the sex of the calf <lb/>[6],[7]. The birth weight in Fleckvieh cattle typically ranges from 38 to 45 kg [8]. <lb/>Calves with strikingly low birth weight and size despite normal gestation length <lb/>are commonly referred to as &quot;dwarfs&quot;. <lb/>Dwarfism (DW) has been observed in several cattle breeds including Fleckvieh <lb/>[9],[10],[11]. Low birth size and postnatal growth restriction are the most <lb/>apparent characteristics of DW. Undersized animals may be normally <lb/>proportionated and have an undisturbed general condition (i.e., proportional <lb/>DW [12]). However, DW may also be accompanied by disproportionately <lb/>shortened limbs and skeletal deformities (i.e., disproportional DW, <lb/>chondrodysplasia [13]). Depending on the severity of the structural aberrations, <lb/>disproportionate DW may be fatal [14],[15]. <lb/>Both autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance has been reported for <lb/>bovine DW (e.g., [12],[15]). Causative mutations for DW were identified in <lb/>Angus (OMIA 001485-9913 [16]), Dexter (OMIA 001271-9913 [14]), Tyrolean <lb/>Grey (OMIA 000187-9913 [13]), Holstein-Friesian (OMIA 001926-9913 [15]) <lb/>and Japanese Brown cattle (OMIA 000187-9913 [17]). However, mutations <lb/>causing DW have not yet been identified in Fleckvieh cattle. <lb/></body>

			<body>Here we present the phenotypic and genetic characterization of autosomal <lb/>recessive DW in Fleckvieh cattle. The use of genome-wide association testing, <lb/>autozygosity mapping and massive re-sequencing data enabled us to identify a <lb/>frameshift mutation in GON4L that is likely causal for the growth failure. <lb/>Methods <lb/>Animal ethics statement <lb/>Two animals were hospitalized at the animal clinic of Ludwigs-Maximilians-<lb/>Universität München. Another two animals were pathologically examined at the <lb/>Institute for Veterinary Disease Control (IVDC) of Austrian Agency for Health <lb/>and Food Safety. One hospitalized calf was euthanized because of recurrent <lb/>tympania with no prospect of improvement and subsequently necropsied. <lb/>Tissue samples were collected during necropsy. All affected animals result <lb/>from inadvertent carrier matings that happened in Fleckvieh farms. No ethical <lb/>approval was required for this study. <lb/>Animals <lb/>Twenty-seven paternal half sibs (16 male, 11 female) with strikingly low birth <lb/>weight and postnatal growth restriction were inspected by breeding consultants <lb/>at the age of three weeks to 18 months. Ear tissue samples were collected by <lb/>breeding consultants and DNA was prepared following standard DNA <lb/>extraction protocols. <lb/>Genotyping, quality control and haplotype inference <lb/>Twenty-seven affected animals were genotyped with the Illumina <lb/>BovineSNP50 v2 BeadChip interrogating genotypes at 54,609 SNP. The per-<lb/>individual call-rate ranged from 98.96% to 99.60% with an average call-rate of <lb/>99.33%. In addition, genotypes of 10,454 unaffected Fleckvieh animals were <lb/></body>

			<page>5 <lb/></page>

			<body>available from genotyping with the Illumina BovineSNP50 v1 BeadChip and the <lb/>Illumina BovineHD BeadChip [18],[19]. The genotype data of cases and <lb/>controls were combined and SNP that were present in both datasets were <lb/>retained for further analyses. Following quality control (minor allele frequency <lb/>above 0.5%, no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P&gt;0.0001), <lb/>per-SNP and per-individual call-rate higher than 95%), 10,481 animals (27 <lb/>affected, 10,454 unaffected) and 44,672 SNP remained for association testing. <lb/>The Beagle software [20] was used to impute sporadically missing genotypes <lb/>and to infer haplotypes. <lb/>Haplotype-based association testing <lb/>A sliding window consisting of 25 contiguous SNP (corresponding to an <lb/>average haplotype length of 1.42±0.43 Mb) was shifted along the genome in <lb/>steps of 2 SNP. Within each sliding window, all haplotypes with a frequency <lb/>above 0.5% (N=787,232) were tested for association with the affection status <lb/>using Fisher exact tests of allelic association. <lb/>Generation of sequence data <lb/>Genomic DNA was prepared from a frozen semen sample of the supposed <lb/>founder (DW het ) and from an ear tissue sample of one affected animal (DW hom ) <lb/>following standard DNA extraction protocols. Paired-end libraries were <lb/>prepared using the paired-end TruSeq DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) <lb/>and sequenced using the HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina). The resulting <lb/>reads were aligned to the University of Maryland reference sequence of the <lb/>bovine genome (UMD3.1 [21]) using the BWA software tool [22]. Individual files <lb/>in SAM format were converted into BAM format using SAMtools [23]. Duplicate <lb/>reads were marked with the MarkDuplicates command of Picard Tools [24]. <lb/>We exploited sequence data from another 288 unaffected animals from nine <lb/>cattle breeds (Gelbvieh, Nordic Finncattle, Fleckvieh, Holstein-Friesian, Brown-<lb/></body>

Beagle phasing and imputation (see above) was used to <lb/>improve the primary genotype calling by SAMtools. Larger insertions and <lb/>deletions and structural rearrangements were identified in DW hom , DW het and <lb/>203 sequenced animals with an average genome fold coverage above 10x <lb/>using the Pindel software package with default settings [27]. <lb/>Identification of candidate causal variants <lb/>To identify mutations compatible with recessive inheritance, all polymorphic <lb/>sites within the segment of extended homozygosity were filtered for variants <lb/>that met three conditions: (i) DW hom was homozygous for the alternate allele, <lb/>(ii) DW het was heterozygous and (iii) all control animals were homozygous for <lb/>the reference allele. Candidate causal variants were annotated using the <lb/>Variant Effect Predictor tool [28],[29]. Sequence variants of 1147 animals from <lb/>Run4 of the 1000 bull genomes project [15] were analyzed to obtain the <lb/>genotype distribution of candidate causal variants in a larger cohort. <lb/>Manual re-annotation of the bovine GON4L-gene <lb/>The genomic structure of GON4L (ENSBTAG00000020356) was predicted <lb/>based on the University of Maryland (UMD3.1) bovine genome sequence <lb/>assembly [21] and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute bovine gene index release <lb/>12.0 [30] using the GenomeThreader software tool [31].

Genotypes for rs723240647 <lb/>and rs715250609 were obtained in 3,879 and 1,848 Fleckvieh animals, <lb/>respectively, using KASP TM (LGC Genomics) genotyping assays. <lb/>Clinical examination of affected animals <lb/>Two affected calves were admitted to the animal clinic at the age of 57 and 93 <lb/>days. Initial examination (including weighing) was performed upon admission. <lb/>The younger calf suffered from recurrent tympania and was euthanized four <lb/>days after admission because of no prospect of improvement and <lb/>subsequently necropsied. Tissue samples were collected during necropsy. The <lb/>older calf was hospitalized for a period of 400 days.

Four affected calves were <lb/>clinically and pathologically examined. At age 61, 97, 101 and 143 days, they <lb/>were underweight at 42, 79, 53 and 51 kg, respectively. The calves had <lb/>multiple craniofacial aberrations (i.e., brachygnatia inferior, elongated narrow <lb/>heads, structural deformities of the muzzle) and spinal distortions. Wrinkled <lb/>skin, areas with excessive skin and a disproportionately large head became <lb/>evident during rearing (Figure 1). Although the general condition, feed intake <lb/>and locomotion of the animals were normal, their growth remained restricted. <lb/>The average weight gain of an affected animal during a hospitalisation period <lb/>of 400 days was only 450 g per day, i.e. less than half the weight gain of <lb/>healthy Fleckvieh bulls (Figure 1H). Since both sexes were affected and most <lb/>dams had a common ancestor, an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance <lb/>was assumed. <lb/></body>

			<body>Dwarfism maps to chromosome 3 <lb/>To identify the genomic region associated with DW, 27 affected and 10,454 <lb/>unaffected animals were genotyped using a medium-density genotyping array. <lb/>After quality control, 44,672 SNP were retained for genome-wide association <lb/>testing. Haplotype-based association testing yielded a striking association with <lb/>DW of a proximal segment of bovine chromosome 3 (Figure 2A). The most <lb/>significant association signal (P=2.18 x 10 -124 ) resulted from two contiguous <lb/>haplotypes located between 14,884,969 bp and 16,557,950 bp. <lb/>Autozygosity mapping revealed a common 1.85 Mb segment (14.88 Mb -<lb/>16.73 Mb) of extended homozygosity in 27 affected animals, corroborating <lb/>recessive inheritance (Figure 2B). The common segment of extended <lb/>homozygosity encompassed 71 transcripts/genes. However, none of them was <lb/>previously associated with DW. <lb/>Figure 2 -Mapping of the genomic region associated with dwarfism. <lb/>Association of 787,232 haplotypes with dwarfism in 27 affected and 10,454 <lb/>unaffected animals (A).

			<body>Of 10,454 control animals, 81 were heterozygous and none was homozygous <lb/>for the DW-associated haplotype, corresponding to a haplotype frequency of <lb/>0.38%. In the recent male breeding population (birth years 2000-2012), the <lb/>frequency of the DW-associated haplotype was 0.25%. The haplotype <lb/>frequency was considerably higher (2.6%) in the female population because of <lb/>the widespread use of an unnoticed carrier bull for artificial insemination [33]. <lb/>Haplotype and pedigree analysis enabled us to track the DW-associated <lb/>haplotype back (up to twelve generations) to an artificial insemination bull <lb/>(DW het ) born in 1959. DW het was present in the maternal and paternal lineage <lb/>of 21 affected animals. However, DW het was not in the pedigree of six dams, <lb/>possibly due to incomplete pedigree information and recording errors. <lb/>Identification of candidate causal variants for dwarfism <lb/>One affected animal (DW hom ) and DW het were sequenced to an average read <lb/>depth of 13x. To help identify the underlying mutation, we additionally exploited <lb/>sequence data of 288 animals from nine breeds including 149 Fleckvieh <lb/>animals. None of 149 sequenced control animals of the Fleckvieh population <lb/>carried the DW-associated haplotype. <lb/>Multi-sample variant calling within the 1.85 Mb segment of extended <lb/>homozygosity revealed 11,475 single nucleotide and short insertion and <lb/>deletion polymorphisms as well as 3,158 larger structural variants. These <lb/>14,633 polymorphic sites were filtered for variants that were compatible with <lb/>recessive inheritance that is homozygous for the alternate allele in DW hom , <lb/>heterozygous in DW het and homozygous for the reference allele in 288 control <lb/>animals (assuming the mutation is recessive and specific for the Fleckvieh <lb/>breed). This approach revealed ten candidate causal variants for DW (Table <lb/>1). Five of them were intergenic, four were located in introns of KCNN3, ADAR <lb/>and TDRD10, and one variant was located in the GON4L coding region. <lb/></body>

In <lb/>conclusion, only an intron variant in TDRD10 (rs715250609) and a coding <lb/>variant in GON4L (rs723240647) segregated with DW. The intron variant in <lb/>TDRD10 is unlikely to be deleterious to protein function because it is more than <lb/>4000 bp distant from the most proximal splice site. We therefore considered <lb/>the coding variant in GON4L (gon-4-like) as the most likely causal mutation for <lb/>DW. <lb/>A 1bp deletion in GON4L is associated with dwarfism <lb/>Bovine GON4L consists of 31 exons encoding 2239 amino acids.

Sanger sequencing confirmed that DW hom and DW het were <lb/>homozygous and heterozygous, respectively, for g.15079217delC. The <lb/>deletion introduces a frameshift in translation predicted to alter the protein <lb/>sequence from amino acid position 1430 onwards, and a premature translation <lb/>termination codon at position 1496 (p.Glu1430LysfsX66).

The ~310 bp <lb/>PCR fragment showed a superimposed sequence of 35 bp at the 5&apos; end of <lb/>exon 21, suggesting the presence of an alternative GON4L transcript. The <lb/>intensity of the alternative cDNA fragment was higher in the mutant <lb/>homozygous than in the wild type animal, possibly indicating degradation of the <lb/>mutant transcript in the homozygous animal.

In conclusion, the <lb/>animal homozygous for the g.15079217delC variant contained both the <lb/>premature translation termination codons at positions 1496 and 1492. <lb/>Figure 4 -Retention of intron 20 of the GON4L gene in a Fleckvieh calf <lb/>with dwarfism.

M -size marker, N -negative RT-PCR control. <lb/>Discussion <lb/>A 1bp deletion in GON4L (g.15079217delC) was associated with DW in <lb/>Fleckvieh cattle. The g.15079217delC variant introduces intron retention and <lb/>premature translation termination resulting in a truncated protein. Compared to <lb/>the wild type variant, the mutant GON4L protein is shortened by more than <lb/>30%. RNA analysis indicated that the mutant protein variant is less abundant, <lb/>suggesting that it may be degraded via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. If <lb/>the truncated protein is (partially) retained, however, its function may be <lb/>compromised because it lacks domains that are possibly essential for normal <lb/>protein function.

			<body>DNA damage and thereby disturb embryonic growth in D. rerio <lb/>[34],[35],[36],[37]. In our study, the g.15079217delC variant was also <lb/>associated with prenatal growth failure as evidenced by strikingly low birth <lb/>weight of homozygous calves. The phenotypic manifestation of homozygosity <lb/>for g.15079217delC, i.e., pre-and postnatal growth restriction and craniofacial <lb/>aberrations, resembles phenotypic patterns of human primordial DW resulting <lb/>from DNA repair disorders [38],[39]. Such findings suggest that disturbed <lb/>growth of homozygous animals might result from defective responses to DNA <lb/>damage due to impaired GON4L function. However, the actual mechanism(s) <lb/>and pathway(s) that cause the extremely low birth weight and postnatal growth <lb/>restriction of homozygous animals have yet to be elucidated. <lb/>Congenital disorders that manifest as growth failure have been identified in <lb/>several cattle breeds. Affected calves may be born underweight or fail to thrive <lb/>during rearing [40],[41],[42],[26]. Homozygosity for g.15079217delC becomes <lb/>evident at birth. Unlike mutations in ACAN and COL2A1 that cause lethal <lb/>disproportionate DW in cattle [14],[15], homozygosity for g.15079217delC is <lb/>not fatal. Apart from large heads, affected animals were normally <lb/>proportionate. Moreover, their general condition and locomotion was normal <lb/>and their weight gain was constant, although considerably less than healthy <lb/>animals. Thus, homozygosity for g.15079217delC is less detrimental than, e.g., <lb/>homozygosity for a mutation in EVC2 which compromises both growth and <lb/>locomotion of affected animals [13]. Nevertheless, homozygous animals are <lb/>more likely to be culled at juvenile ages because of their reduced growth <lb/>performance. <lb/>The g.15079217delC variant has segregated in the Fleckvieh population for <lb/>more than fifty years, but due to its low frequency DW was rarely reported. <lb/>Assuming a frequency of 0.2% of the deleterious allele, equal use of all bulls <lb/>and 1,500,000 annual births in the German and Austrian Fleckvieh <lb/>populations, one would expect only six homozygous calves with DW per year. <lb/></body>

			<body>However, the widespread use of unnoticed carriers of rare recessive alleles in <lb/>artificial insemination may cause a sudden accumulation of affected calves, as <lb/>our study demonstrates. Twenty-seven calves with DW were descendants from <lb/>a bull that was used for more than 290,000 inseminations. The heavy use of <lb/>this carrier bull resulted in a more than tenfold increase in allele frequency in <lb/>the female population [33]. Our findings now enable the rapid identification of <lb/>carrier animals. The g.15079217delC variant was in almost complete linkage <lb/>disequilibrium with the DW-associated haplotype, demonstrating a high <lb/>sensitivity and specificity of haplotype-based identification of mutation carriers. <lb/>Since all male breeding animals are routinely genotyped with dense <lb/>genotyping arrays, carriers can be readily identified using haplotype <lb/>information. Excluding carrier bulls from artificial insemination will prevent the <lb/>emergence of homozygous animals and remove from the Fleckvieh population <lb/>the rare DW-associated allele within a few generations. However, sophisticated <lb/>strategies are required to simultaneously consider multiple deleterious alleles <lb/>in genomic breeding programs while maintaining genetic diversity and high <lb/>rates of genetic gain [43],[44]. <lb/>Conclusions <lb/>A frameshift variant in GON4L was associated with autosomal recessive DW in <lb/>Fleckvieh cattle. The deleterious allele persisted in the Fleckvieh population for <lb/>more than fifty years at very low frequency without being recognized as a <lb/>genetic disorder. However, the heavy use of an unnoticed carrier bull for <lb/>artificial insemination resulted in an accumulation of homozygous calves with <lb/>DW and a tenfold increase in frequency of the deleterious allele in the female <lb/>population. Our results provide the basis for the rapid identification of carrier <lb/>bulls and the implementation of genome-based mating strategies to avoid <lb/>inadvertent carrier matings, thereby preventing the birth of homozygous calves <lb/>with unsatisfactory growth performance. <lb/></body>
