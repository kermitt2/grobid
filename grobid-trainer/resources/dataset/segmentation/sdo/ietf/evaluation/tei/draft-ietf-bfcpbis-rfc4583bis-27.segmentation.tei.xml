                  1. Introduction <lb/>As discussed in the BFCP (Binary Floor Control Protocol) <lb/>specification [I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis], a given BFCP client <lb/>needs a set of data in order to establish a BFCP connection to a <lb/>floor control server. This data includes the transport address of <lb/>the server, the conference identifier, and the user identifier. <lb/>One way for clients to obtain this information is to use an SDP <lb/>offer/answer [RFC3264] exchange. This document specifies how to <lb/>encode this information in the SDP session descriptions that are part <lb/>of such an offer/answer exchange. <lb/>User agents typically use the offer/answer model to establish a <lb/>number of media streams of different types. Following this model, a <lb/>BFCP connection is described as any other media stream by using an <lb/>SDP &apos;m&apos; line, possibly followed by a number of SDP lines that also <lb/>apply to the BFCP connection. <lb/>Section 4 defines how the field values in &apos;m&apos; line representing a <lb/>BFCP connection are set. <lb/>Section 5 defines SDP attributes that are used when negotiating a <lb/>BFCP connection. <lb/>Section 6 defines multiplexing considerations for a BFCP connection. <lb/>Section 7 defines procedures for managing a BFCP connection. <lb/>Section 8 defines TLS and DTLS considerations when negotiating a BFCP <lb/>connection. <lb/>Section 9 defines the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <lb/>[RFC8445] considerations when negotiating a BFCP connection. <lb/>Section 10 defines the SDP offer/answer procedures for negotiating a <lb/>BFCP connection. <lb/>2. Conventions <lb/>The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, <lb/>&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and <lb/>&quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP <lb/>14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all <lb/>capitals, as shown here. <lb/>

                  3. Floor Control Roles <lb/>When two endpoints establish a BFCP stream, they need to determine <lb/>which of them acts as a floor control client and which acts as a <lb/>floor control server. <lb/>Once the roles have been determined, the roles will apply to all <lb/>BFCP-controlled streams associated with the BFCP stream. <lb/>4. Fields in the &apos;m&apos; Line <lb/>According to the SDP specification [RFC4566], the &apos;m&apos; line format is <lb/>the following: <lb/>m=&lt;media&gt; &lt;port&gt; &lt;proto&gt; &lt;fmt&gt; ... <lb/>This section describes how to generate an &apos;m&apos; line of an SDP Media <lb/>Description (&apos;m&apos; section) describing a BFCP stream. <lb/>The media field MUST have a value of &quot;application&quot;. <lb/>The port field is set depending on the value of the proto field, as <lb/>explained below. A port field value of zero has the standard SDP <lb/>meaning (i.e., rejection of the media stream) regardless of the proto <lb/>field. <lb/>When TCP is used as the transport, the port field is set following <lb/>the rules in [RFC4145]. Depending on the value of the &apos;setup&apos; <lb/>attribute (discussed in Section 7.1), the port field contains the <lb/>port to which the remote endpoint will direct BFCP messages, or in <lb/>the case where the endpoint will initiate the connection towards <lb/>the remote endpoint, should be set to a value of 9. <lb/>When UDP is used as the transport, the port field contains the <lb/>port to which the remote endpoint will direct BFCP messages <lb/>regardless of the value of the &apos;setup&apos; attribute. <lb/>This document defines five values for the proto field: TCP/BFCP, <lb/>TCP/DTLS/BFCP, TCP/TLS/BFCP, UDP/BFCP, and UDP/TLS/BFCP. <lb/>The proto value are used as described below: <lb/>&apos;TCP/BFCP&apos; is used for TCP transport of BFCP without TLS <lb/>encryption, and is backward compatible with RFC 4583 compliant <lb/>endpoints. <lb/>

                  &apos;TCP/TLS/BFCP&apos; is used for TCP transport of BFCP with TLS <lb/>encryption, and is backward compatible with RFC 4583 compliant <lb/>endpoints that support TLS. <lb/>&apos;UDP/BFCP&apos; is used for UDP transport of BFCP without DTLS <lb/>encryption [RFC6347]. <lb/>&apos;UDP/TLS/BFCP&apos; is used for UDP transport of BFCP with DTLS <lb/>encryption. This is one of the options when ICE is used <lb/>(Section 9). It can also be used without ICE when backward <lb/>compatibility with RFC 4583 compliant endpoints is not required. <lb/>&apos;TCP/DTLS/BFCP&apos; is used for TCP transport of BFCP with DTLS <lb/>encryption, running on top of TCP using the framing method defined <lb/>in [RFC4571], with DTLS packets being sent and received instead of <lb/>RTP/RTCP packets using the shim defined in RFC 4571 such that the <lb/>length field defined in RFC 4571 precedes each DTLS message. This <lb/>is one of the options when ICE is used (Section 9). It can also <lb/>be used without ICE when backward compatibility with RFC 4583 <lb/>compliant endpoints is not required. <lb/>The fmt (format) list is not applicable to BFCP. The fmt list of &apos;m&apos; <lb/>lines in the case of any proto field value related to BFCP MUST <lb/>contain a single &quot;*&quot; character. If the the fmt list contains any <lb/>other value it MUST be ignored. <lb/>The following is an example of an &apos;m&apos; line for a BFCP connection: <lb/>m=application 50000 TCP/TLS/BFCP * <lb/>5. SDP Attributes <lb/>5.1. SDP &apos;floorctrl&apos; Attribute <lb/>This section defines the SDP &apos;floorctrl&apos; media-level attribute. The <lb/>attribute is used to determine the floor control roles (client and <lb/>server) for the endpoints associated with the BFCP stream. <lb/>

When inserted in an <lb/>answer, the answerer MUST indicate only one attribute value: &quot;c-only&quot; <lb/>or &quot;s-only&quot;. The answerer indicates the role taken by the answerer. <lb/>The offerer will then take the opposite role. <lb/>In [RFC4583], there was a third attribute specified, &quot;c-s&quot;, which <lb/>meant that an endpoint was willing to act as both floor control <lb/>client and floor control server at the same time for the BFCP stream, <lb/>taking different roles for different BFCP-controlled media streams. <lb/>The feature was underspecified and implemented in different ways, in <lb/>particular many implementations interpreted &quot;c-s&quot; to mean that the <lb/>endpoint is willing to act as either client or server (equivalent to <lb/>&quot;c-only s-only&quot;). An implementation compliant to this specification <lb/>MUST NOT include the &quot;c-s&quot; floorctl attribute value in an offer or in <lb/>an answer, but MUST accept the attribute value in an offer and <lb/>process it as equivalent to &quot;c-only s-only&quot; (or &quot;s-only c-only&quot;). <lb/>Also, as an implementation compliant to this specification is only <lb/>allowed to include one role, either &apos;c-only&apos; or &apos;s-conly&apos;, in an <lb/>answer, each endpoint will only take one role, and as a result the <lb/>endpoint will take the same role for each BFCP-controlled media <lb/>stream associated with the BFCP stream. <lb/>Table 1 shows the roles that the answerer is allowed to take, based <lb/>on what roles the offerer has indicated that it is willing to take. <lb/>

For a given <lb/>version, the attribute value representing the version MUST match the <lb/>&quot;Version&quot; field that would be presented in the BFCP COMMON-HEADER <lb/>[I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis]. The BFCP version that will eventually <lb/>be used will be conveyed with a BFCP-level Hello/HelloAck. <lb/>Endpoints compliant with [RFC4583] might not always include the <lb/>&apos;bfcpver&apos; attribute in offers and answers.

If the attribute is not <lb/>present, endpoints MUST assume a default value in accordance with <lb/>[I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis]: when used over a reliable transport <lb/>the default attribute value is &quot;1&quot;, and when used over an unreliable <lb/>transport the default attribute value is &quot;2&quot;.

                  BUNDLE group [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]. Note that <lb/>BFCP-controlled media streams might be multiplexed with other media <lb/>streams. <lb/>[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes] defines the mux categories for <lb/>the SDP attributes defined in this specification, except for the <lb/>&apos;bfcpver&apos; attribute. Table 2 defines the mux category for the <lb/>&apos;bfcpver&apos; attribute: <lb/>+---------+-------------------------------------+-------+-----------+ <lb/>| Name <lb/>| Notes <lb/>| Level | Mux <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| Category | <lb/>+---------+-------------------------------------+-------+-----------+ <lb/>| bfcpver | Needs further analysis in a <lb/>| M <lb/>| TBD <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| separate specification <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>| <lb/>+---------+-------------------------------------+-------+-----------+ <lb/>Table 2: Multiplexing Attribute Analysis <lb/>7. BFCP Connection Management <lb/>BFCP streams can use TCP or UDP as the underlying transport. <lb/>Endpoints exchanging BFCP messages over UDP send the BFCP messages <lb/>towards the peer using the connection address and port provided in <lb/>the SDP &apos;c&apos; and &apos;m&apos; lines. TCP connection management is more <lb/>complicated and is described in the following Section. <lb/>Note: When using Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <lb/>[RFC8445], TCP/DTLS/BFCP, or UDP/TLS/BFCP, the straight-forward <lb/>procedures for connection management as UDP/BFCP described above <lb/>apply. TCP/TLS/BFCP follows the same procedures as TCP/BFCP and <lb/>is described below. <lb/>7.1. TCP Connection Management <lb/>The management of the TCP connection used to transport BFCP messages <lb/>is performed using the SDP &apos;setup&apos; and &apos;connection&apos; attributes <lb/>[RFC4145]. The &apos;setup&apos; attribute indicates which of the endpoints <lb/>initiates the TCP connection. The &apos;connection&apos; attribute handles TCP <lb/>connection re-establishment. <lb/>The BFCP specification [I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis] describes a <lb/>number of situations when the TCP connection between a floor control <lb/>client and the floor control server needs to be re-established. <lb/>However, that specification does not describe the re-establishment <lb/>process because this process depends on how the connection was <lb/>established in the first place. Endpoints using the offer/answer <lb/>mechanism follow the following rules. <lb/>

                  When the existing TCP connection is closed and re-established <lb/>following the rules in [I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis], the floor <lb/>control client MUST send an offer towards the floor control server in <lb/>order to re-establish the connection. If a TCP connection cannot <lb/>deliver a BFCP message and times out, the endpoint that attempted to <lb/>send the message (i.e., the one that detected the TCP timeout) MUST <lb/>send an offer in order to re-establish the TCP connection. <lb/>Endpoints that use the offer/answer mechanism to negotiate TCP <lb/>connections MUST support the &apos;setup&apos; and &apos;connection&apos; attributes. <lb/>8. TLS/DTLS Considerations <lb/>When DTLS is used with UDP, the generic procedures defined in <lb/>Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-mmusic-dtls-sdp] MUST be followed. <lb/>When TLS is used with TCP, once the underlying connection is <lb/>established, the answerer always acts as the TLS server. If the TCP <lb/>connection is lost, the active endpoint [RFC4583] is responsible for <lb/>re-establishing the TCP connection. Unless a new TLS connection is <lb/>negotiated, subsequent SDP offers and answers will not impact the <lb/>previously negotiated TLS roles. <lb/>Note: For TLS, it was decided to keep the original procedures in <lb/>[RFC4583] to determine which endpoint acts as the TLS server in <lb/>order to retain backwards compatibility. <lb/>9. ICE Considerations <lb/>Generic SDP offer/answer procedures for Interactive Connectivity <lb/>Establishment (ICE) are defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp]. <lb/>When BFCP is used with UDP based ICE candidates [RFC8445] then the <lb/>procedures for UDP/TLS/BFCP are used. <lb/>When BFCP is used with TCP based ICE candidates [RFC6544] then the <lb/>procedures for TCP/DTLS/BFCP are used. <lb/>Based on the procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-dtls-sdp], <lb/>endpoints treat all ICE candidate pairs associated with a BFCP stream <lb/>on top of a DTLS association as part of the same DTLS association. <lb/>Thus, there will only be one BFCP handshake and one DTLS handshake <lb/>even if there are multiple valid candidate pairs, and if BFCP media <lb/>is shifted between candidate pairs (including switching between UDP <lb/>to TCP candidate pairs) prior to nomination. If new candidates are <lb/>added, they will also be part of the same DTLS association. <lb/>

                  In order to maximize the likelihood of interoperability between the <lb/>endpoints, all ICE enabled BFCP-over-DTLS endpoints SHOULD implement <lb/>support for UDP/TLS/BFCP. <lb/>When an SDP offer or answer conveys multiple ICE candidates for a <lb/>BFCP stream, UDP based candidates SHOULD be included and the default <lb/>candidate SHOULD be chosen from one of those UDP candidates. If UDP <lb/>transport is used for the default candidate, then the &apos;m&apos; line proto <lb/>value MUST be &apos;UDP/TLS/BFCP&apos;. If TCP transport is used for the <lb/>default candidate, the &apos;m&apos; line proto value MUST be &apos;TCP/DTLS/BFCP&apos;. <lb/>Note: Usage of ICE with protocols other than UDP/TLS/BFCP and <lb/>TCP/DTLS/BFCP is outside of scope for this specification. <lb/>10. SDP Offer/Answer Procedures <lb/>This section defines the SDP offer/answer [RFC3264] procedures for <lb/>negotiating and establishing a BFCP stream. Generic procedures for <lb/>DTLS are defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-dtls-sdp]. Generic procedures <lb/>for TLS are defined in [RFC8122]. <lb/>This section only defines the BFCP-specific procedures. Unless <lb/>explicitly stated otherwise, the procedures apply to an &apos;m&apos; section <lb/>describing a BFCP stream. If an offer or answer contains multiple <lb/>&apos;m&apos; sections describing BFCP streams, the procedures are applied <lb/>independently to each stream. <lb/>Within this document, &apos;initial offer&apos; refers to the first offer, <lb/>within an SDP session (e.g. a SIP dialog when the Session Initiation <lb/>Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] is used to carry SDP) in which the offerer <lb/>indicates that it wants to negotiate the establishment of a BFCP <lb/>stream. <lb/>If the &apos;m&apos; line &apos;proto&apos; value is &apos;TCP/TLS/BFCP&apos;, &apos;TCP/DTLS/BFCP&apos; or <lb/>&apos;UDP/TLS/BFCP&apos;, the offerer and answerer follow the generic <lb/>procedures defined in [RFC8122]. <lb/>If the &apos;m&apos; line proto value is &apos;TCP/BFCP&apos;, &apos;TCP/TLS/BFCP&apos;, &apos;TCP/DTLS/ <lb/>TCP&apos; or &apos;UDP/TLS/BFCP&apos;, the offerer and answerer use the SDP &apos;setup&apos; <lb/>attribute according to the procedures in [RFC4145]. <lb/>If the &apos;m&apos; line proto value is &apos;TCP/BFCP&apos;, &apos;TCP/TLS/BFCP&apos; or <lb/>&apos;TCP/DTLS/BFCP&apos;, the offerer and anwerer use the SDP &apos;connection&apos; <lb/>attribute according to the procedures in [RFC4145]. <lb/>Note: The use of source-specific SDP parameters [RFC5576] is not <lb/>defined for BFCP streams. <lb/>

                  10.1. Generating the Initial SDP Offer <lb/>When the offerer creates an initial offer, the offerer MUST include <lb/>an SDP &apos;floorctrl&apos; attribute (Section 5.1) and an SDP &apos;bfcpver&apos; <lb/>attribute (Section 5.5) in the &apos;m&apos; section. <lb/>In addition, if the offerer includes an SDP &apos;floorctrl&apos; attribute <lb/>with &apos;s-only&apos; or &apos;c-s&apos; attribute values in the offer, the offerer: <lb/>o MUST include an SDP &apos;confid&apos; attribute (Section 5.2) in the &apos;m&apos; <lb/>section; and <lb/>o MUST include an SDP &apos;userid&apos; attribute (Section 5.3) in the &apos;m&apos; <lb/>section; and <lb/>o MUST include an SDP &apos;floorid&apos; attribute (Section 5.4) in the &apos;m&apos; <lb/>section; and <lb/>o MUST include an SDP &apos;label&apos; attribute ([RFC4574]) with the &apos;m&apos; <lb/>section of each BFCP-controlled media stream. <lb/>Note: If the offerer includes an SDP &apos;floorctrl&apos; attribute with a <lb/>&apos;c-s&apos; attribute value, or both a &apos;c-only&apos; and a &apos;s-only&apos; attribute <lb/>value in the offer, the attribute values above will only be used <lb/>if it is determined (Section 5.1) that the offerer will act as <lb/>floor control server. <lb/>10.2. Generating the SDP Answer <lb/>When the answerer receives an offer that contains an &apos;m&apos; section <lb/>describing a BFCP stream, the answerer MUST check whether it supports <lb/>one or more of the BFCP versions supported by the offerer <lb/>(Section 5.5). If the answerer does not support any of the BFCP <lb/>versions, it MUST NOT accept the &apos;m&apos; section. Otherwise, if the <lb/>answerer accepts the &apos;m&apos; section, it: <lb/>o MUST insert a corresponding &apos;m&apos; section in the answer, with an <lb/>identical &apos;m&apos; line proto value [RFC3264]; and <lb/>o MUST include a &apos;bfcpver&apos; attribute in the &apos;m&apos; section. The <lb/>versions indicated by the answer MUST be the same or a subset of <lb/>the versions indicated by the offerer in the corresponding offer; <lb/>and <lb/>o MUST, if the offer contained an SDP &apos;floorctrl&apos; attribute, include <lb/>a &apos;floorctrl&apos; attribute in the &apos;m&apos; section. <lb/>

                  13.5. Registration of the SDP &apos;floorid&apos; Attribute <lb/>This document defines the SDP attribute,&apos;floorid&apos;. The details of <lb/>the attribute are defined in Section 5.4. <lb/>13.6. Registration of the SDP &apos;bfcpver&apos; Attribute <lb/>This document defines the SDP attribute,&apos;bfcpver&apos;. The details of <lb/>the attribute are defined in Section 5.5. <lb/>14. Changes from RFC 4583 <lb/>Following is the list of technical changes and other fixes from <lb/>[RFC4583]. <lb/>Main purpose of this work was to add signaling support necessary to <lb/>support BFCP over unreliable transport, as described in <lb/>[I-D.ietf-bfcpbis-rfc4582bis], resulting in the following changes: <lb/>1. Fields in the &apos;m&apos; line (Section 4): <lb/>The section is re-written to remove reference to the exclusivity <lb/>of TCP as a transport for BFCP streams. The proto field values <lb/>TCP/DTLS/BFCP, UDP/BFCP and UDP/TLS/BFCP added. <lb/>2. Security Considerations (Section 12): <lb/>For the DTLS over UDP case, mention existing considerations and <lb/>requirements for the offer/answer exchange in <lb/>[I-D.ietf-mmusic-dtls-sdp]. <lb/>3. Registration of SDP &apos;proto&apos; Values (Section 13.1): <lb/>Register the three new values TCP/DTLS/BFCP, UDP/BFCP and <lb/>UDP/TLS/BFCP in the SDP parameters registry. <lb/>4. BFCP Version Negotiation (Section 5.5): <lb/>A new &apos;bfcpver&apos; SDP media-level attribute is added in order to <lb/>signal supported version number. <lb/>In addition to the changes associated with support of BFCP over <lb/>unreliable transport, the possibility for an endpoint to act as both <lb/>floor control client and floor control server at the same time has <lb/>been removed. An endpoint will now take the same role for all BFCP-<lb/>controlled streams associated with the BFCP stream. <lb/>Clarification and bug fixes: <lb/>1. Errata ID: 712 (Section 3 and Section 10): <lb/>

                  Language clarification. Don&apos;t use terms like an SDP attribute is <lb/>&quot;used in an &apos;m&apos; line&quot;, instead make clear that the attribute is a <lb/>media-level attribute. <lb/>2. Fix typo in example (Section 11): <lb/>Do not use &apos;m-stream&apos; in the SDP example, use the correct &apos;mstrm&apos; <lb/>as specified in Section 11. Recommend interpreting &apos;m-stream&apos; if <lb/>it is received, since it is present in some implementations. <lb/>3. Assorted clarifications (Across the document): <lb/>Language clarifications as a result of reviews. Also, the <lb/>normative language where tightened where appropriate, i.e. <lb/>changed from SHOULD strength to MUST in a number of places. <lb/>
