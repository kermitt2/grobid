			<p>For endurance activities with high levels of energy ex-<lb/>penditure, energy intake is an important variable to be<lb/> considered when devising strategies for optimizing per-<lb/>formance <ref type="biblio">[1–3]</ref>. High exercise intensities over prolonged<lb/> periods imply high carbohydrate (CHO) and also fat oxi-<lb/>dation rates <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. CHO and fat availability are thus im-<lb/>portant determinants of energy expenditure and it is<lb/> paramount that athletes use optimal nutritional strat-<lb/>egies, not only to manage intake during races, but also<lb/> before races, to optimize storage, and after races, to<lb/> optimize refuelling <ref type="biblio">[2, 3, 5–7]</ref>. There exists a plethora of<lb/> literature on sports nutrition, and several scientific and<lb/> sports organizations such as the American Dietetic As-<lb/>sociation (ADA), the Dieticians of Canada (DC) and the<lb/> American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM) <ref type="biblio">[2, 8]</ref>, the<lb/> International Olympic Committee (IOC) <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref> and the<lb/> International Society for Sport Nutrition (ISSN) <ref type="biblio">[10, 11]<lb/></ref> have published recommendations and guidelines on en-<lb/>ergy intake before, during and after exercise <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Para-<lb/>doxically, there is relative paucity of literature reporting<lb/> actual athlete nutritional behaviour <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. Among ath-<lb/>letes, actual nutritional behaviour does not always com-<lb/>ply with the official recommendations, because of a lack<lb/> of knowledge <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>, mistaken beliefs, lack of interest or<lb/> motivation, practical problems, or perhaps intuition <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>.<lb/> Nutrition knowledge and beliefs can influence food be-<lb/>haviour <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>, even if the relationship is not necessarily<lb/> obvious. Improved nutritional knowledge plays a role in<lb/> the adoption of healthier food habits <ref type="biblio">[16, 17]</ref> and this is<lb/> likely also the case for sport nutrition. Better insight into<lb/> actual athlete behaviour and its determinants is of im-<lb/>portance for adapting guidelines in view of improving<lb/> compliance <ref type="biblio">[18, 19]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>A particular type endurance sport is ski-mountaineering<lb/> racing, consisting of climbing uphill on alpine skis with<lb/> the heals unlocked in special pivoting bindings and adhe-<lb/>sive skins applied to the gliding surface, alternated by ski-<lb/>ing downhill with the skins removed and the bindings in<lb/> the locked position. What makes this sport particular is<lb/> that it combines very strenuous activity in different loco-<lb/>motion modes with exposure to altitude hypoxia and<lb/> temperature extremes. Especially uphill the exercise inten-<lb/>sity is high with a large fraction of time spend around the<lb/> respiratory compensation threshold <ref type="biblio">[20–22]</ref>. The most<lb/> popular and famous ski-mountaineering races are gener-<lb/>ally team races that can last from 4 to more than 12 h. We<lb/> previously quantified energy expenditure during a famous<lb/> Swiss ski-mountaineering race (&apos;Patrouille des Glaciers&apos;)<lb/> and found that it was very high: more than 20 MJ<lb/> (4,800 kcal) for the shorter race route (distance: 26 km;<lb/> altitude differences: +1881 m and −2341 m; maximal alti-<lb/>tude: 3160 m) and more than 35 MJ (8,400 kcal) for the<lb/> longer one (distance: 53 km; altitude differences: +3994 m<lb/> and−4090 m; maximal altitude: 3650 m) <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The goal of the present study was to get a global per-<lb/>spective on pre-race nutritional habits among amateur<lb/> ski-mountaineers during the 4 days preceding this major<lb/> multi-hour ski-mountaineering race. Four different as-<lb/>pects were investigated: 1) pre-competition nutritional<lb/> practice; 2) comparison between practice and recom-<lb/>mendations; 3) comparison of food behaviour between<lb/> participants in longer and shorter races; and 4) know-<lb/>ledge and beliefs about pre-race nutrition.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head>

			<p>Seventy participants in two multi-hour ski-mountaineering<lb/> races were recruited for a study about ski-mountaineering<lb/> racing (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). They were healthy and trained skiers, who<lb/> took part in one of the two racecourses of the &apos;Patrouille<lb/> des Glaciers&apos; 2012 <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. The nutritional part of the study<lb/> was optional for participants. The Valais cantonal research<lb/> ethics committee approved the protocol of the study<lb/> (CCVEM 033/11) and each participant gave informed<lb/> written consent prior to participation.<lb/></p>

			<head>Laboratory measurements<lb/></head>

			<p>Between 2 and 3 months prior to the race, the subjects<lb/> came to the laboratory, where anthropometric features,<lb/> body composition and maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2max )<lb/> were determined. Body fat percentage was measured by<lb/> air displacement plethysmography (BodPod, Cosmed,<lb/> Italy). The subjects performed a maximal running test<lb/> on a motorized treadmill (HP Cosmos Pulsar, Germany)<lb/> to determine VO 2max . After warm-up (3 min at 5.4 km ·<lb/> h −1 ), speed was set at 7.2 km · h −1 and increased by<lb/> 1.8 km · h −1 every 3 min without breaks between stages<lb/> up to voluntary exhaustion under strong verbal encour-<lb/>agement. The inclination of the treadmill was 0 %. Gas<lb/> exchange and breathing variables were measured breath-<lb/>by-breath throughout with a metabolic measurement<lb/> system (Metalyser, Cortex, Germany). The data obtained<lb/> during the last 30 s of each step were considered for the<lb/> analysis. The metabolic system was calibrated prior to<lb/> each experimental session with a 3 l syringe and gases of<lb/> known composition.<lb/></p>

			<head>The races<lb/></head>

			<p>The &apos;Patrouille des Glaciers&apos; is the most famous and popu-<lb/>lar ski-mountaineering race in Switzerland. It is a long<lb/> duration high altitude team race (teams of three) and con-<lb/>sists of two different race routes: race Z from Zermatt to<lb/> Verbier (distance: 53 km; altitude differences: +3994 m<lb/> and−4090 m; maximal altitude: 3650 m) and race A from<lb/> Arolla to Verbier (distance: 26 km; altitude differences:<lb/> +1881 m and−2341 m; maximal altitude: 3160 m).<lb/></p>

			<head>Food intake<lb/></head>

			<p>We asked the subjects to complete food diaries during the<lb/> 4 days preceding the race. They had to write down every-<lb/>thing they ate or drank with as much detail as possible<lb/> about the quality and quantity of food items consumed.<lb/> The subjects received detailed instructions and examples<lb/> to help them to appropriately complete their diaries. The<lb/></p> 

			<figure>Fig. 1 Study flowchart<lb/> </figure>

			<p>data were analysed with a nutrient analysis software pack-<lb/>age (Prodi 5.3, Nutri-Science GmbH, Germany).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Fifty-three journals were collected: 13 were eliminated<lb/> from analysis, because they were incomplete, unclear or<lb/> unreadable. 40 journals were analysed: 19 were journals<lb/> of subjects of race Z (4 women and 15 men, 30 ±<lb/> 10 years, 176 ± 7 cm, 70 ± 9 kg, 15 ± 5 % of fat mass,<lb/> VO 2max : 50 ± 8 ml · kg −1 · min −1 and 21 of race A (6<lb/> women and 15 men, 40 ± 7 years, 176 ± 7 cm, 72 ±<lb/> 10 kg, 18 ± 8 % fat mass, VO 2max : 58 ± 8 ml · kg −1 ·<lb/> min −1 ). Energy, macronutrients (CHO, fat and pro-<lb/>teins) and liquid intakes were analysed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Beliefs<lb/></head>

			<p>Using the diaries, individual semi-structured interviews<lb/> were held two years later with a pool of 10 subjects of<lb/> those with a complete diary. These interviews focused<lb/> on the beliefs about feeding before the race. There were<lb/> six main questions: 1) tell me more about the import-<lb/>ance that you assigned to nutrition during the prepar-<lb/>ation for the race; 2) what was your food behaviour<lb/> during the 4 days preceding the race; 3) tell me more<lb/> about your liquid intake during the 4 days preceding the<lb/> race; 4) if you were used to consume food supplements,<lb/> what importance did you assign to these during the<lb/> 4 days preceding the race; 5) if you were used to con-<lb/>sume sports food, which importance did you assign to<lb/> these during the 4 days preceding the race; and 6) where<lb/> did you get your information about the nutrition and<lb/> food strategies you applied? Based on the initial answers<lb/> to these questions the interviewers asked the partici-<lb/>pants further questions, to develop and explore details<lb/> about points that seemed to be especially interesting or<lb/> needed clarification. Five subjects for each race route<lb/> were interviewed. We purposely handpicked a diversified<lb/> sample: three women and seven men, 22 to 56 years, 5<lb/> to 37 % of fat mass, VO 2 max from 32 to 67 ml kg −1 ·<lb/> min −1 (40 ± 10 years, 175 ± 6 cm, 70 ± 11 kg, 16 ± 9 % of<lb/> fat mass, VO 2 max: 53 ± 10 ml · kg −1 · min −1 ).<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>An ANOVA was used to test whether the four analysed<lb/> days were similar and to see if pooled mean values could<lb/> be used for further analysis. For each nutrient the mean<lb/> and standard deviation values were calculated for the<lb/> whole population and for the participants in the race Z<lb/> and the race A separately. T-tests were performed to verify<lb/> if there were differences between the participants in the<lb/> shorter and the longer race. Linear regressions were per-<lb/>formed to verify associations between sex, body compos-<lb/>ition or VO 2 max and aspects of nutritional behaviour.<lb/> Data were analysed with the software Stata (StataCorp,<lb/> USA). A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant.<lb/></p>

			<head>Food intake and recommendations<lb/></head>

			<p>There was no significant difference concerning the main<lb/> analysed variables (energy, CHO and drinking intake)<lb/> between the four analysed days, so the data were pooled<lb/> and the mean values of the 4 days were used for further<lb/> analysis. The mean energy consumption was 2416 ±<lb/> 696 kcal · day −1 . 54 ± 8 % of the daily energy intake was<lb/> from CHO, 28 ± 6 % from fat and 18 ± 5 % from protein<lb/> (<ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). CHO intake was 46 ± 13 % below the<lb/> recommended intake levels (10–12 g · body weight<lb/> (BW) · day −1 ) (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Consequently energy consumption<lb/> was low too (83 ± 17 % of recommended intake (Harris<lb/> and Benedict · 1.8 (low exercise intensity, corresponding<lb/> to a pre-race tapering period) <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>), but the deficit was<lb/> limited because fat and protein intake partly compen-<lb/>sated the lack of CHO intake (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). The energy intake<lb/> through fat was 29 ± 6 % (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>) of the total daily energy<lb/> intake (recommendations: between 15 and 30 %) while<lb/> protein intake was 100 ± 28 % of the minimal recom-<lb/>mended intake for athletes in daily life (1.3 g · kg −1 BW ·<lb/> day −1 ). The mean liquid intake was 2.7 ± 1.0 l · day −1<lb/> (slightly above recommendations, 1 ml · kcal −1 · day −1 in<lb/> daily life, 2.4 l · day −1 ), partly compliant with the guide-<lb/>lines to already increase the liquid intake before the be-<lb/>ginning of a race, without giving a specific amount <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>One third of the participants took mineral or vitamin<lb/> supplements. Magnesium was the most commonly used<lb/> mineral (25 % of the participants) while vitamin supple-<lb/>ment intake was also frequent (20 % of the participants).<lb/> 23 participants (58 %) consumed CHO-rich sports food<lb/> or drinks, of which 20 % took maltodextrin to increase<lb/> CHO intake.<lb/></p> 

			<p>There were few differences between the nutritional be-<lb/>haviour of men and women: men consumed more en-<lb/>ergy from fat (p = 0.049) and tended to consume less<lb/> energy from CHO (p = 0.061) than women. A higher<lb/> body fat percentage was negatively associated with<lb/> </p>

			<head>Knowledge and beliefs<lb/></head>

			<p>All the interviewed subjects indicated that nutrition<lb/> during the 4 days preceding a long duration ski-<lb/>mountaineering race is relevant for performance. Six of<lb/> the 10 interviewed subjects found it important or very<lb/> important while four found it of little or moderate im-<lb/>portance. Three common representations could be<lb/> highlighted in the interviews: 1) during the 4 days before<lb/> such a race it is good to eat (lots of ) pasta to fill up en-<lb/>ergy stores (all interviewed subjects); 2) during these<lb/> days water intake has to be increased (9/10); and 3) it is<lb/> better to eat white meat than red meat (5/10).<lb/></p>

			<p>For the comparison of beliefs with practice, as esti-<lb/>mated with the food diaries, we found, on the basis of<lb/> eight main meals over the 4 days analysed for each sub-<lb/>ject: 1) On average 4.9 ± 1.2 of them included pasta<lb/> (55 % of meals); these values were 4.4 ± 1.2 meals and<lb/> 61 %, respectively, for all 40 subjects; 2) The subjects<lb/> drank 2.2 ± 1.4 l · day −1 (2.7 ± 1.0 l · day −1 for all 40 par-<lb/>ticipants); 3) For the participants in the race Z, who had<lb/> dinner just before the race (the participants in the race<lb/> A started in the morning and had breakfast as the last<lb/> meal before the race): two of the five interviewed sub-<lb/>jects ate white meat during the last dinner (8 of the 19<lb/> participants (42 %) who completed the food journal).<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to enhance performance and to ensure digest-<lb/>ive comfort, some other food items were avoided: four<lb/> athletes avoided or decreased fat food intake (in particu-<lb/>lar cheese), three athletes spoke about alcohol avoidance,<lb/> one of the ten took care not to eat too much and one<lb/> avoided vegetables and salads.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 2 Average percentage of the daily energy intake from CHO, fat and protein. ACSM guidelines for athletes recommend that CHO should<lb/> represent 50 to 70 % of the total daily energy intake, protein between 10 and 35 % and fat between 20 and 35 % [41]<lb/></figure>

			<figure>Fig. 3 Comparison recommendation-reality for energy and CHO<lb/> consumption. The entire column represents the recommendation<lb/> (100 %) and the black part the average declared intake for all 40<lb/> subjects (in percentage of the recommendation)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Most of the subjects spoke about food supplements<lb/> (6/10). Four athletes took magnesium (against muscle<lb/> cramps (3) or to improve blood flow (1)); one athlete took<lb/> calcium (also against muscle cramps), one of them spoke<lb/> about caffeine and one about vitamins. Six indicated that<lb/> they took sports foods, mostly CHO drinks (4/10), CHO-<lb/>rich cake (2/10) and maltodextrine (2/10), and protein<lb/> bars and shakes to preserve muscle mass (1/10).<lb/></p>

			<p>The most often quoted sources of information about<lb/> pre-race nutrition were friends and family (4/10), and per-<lb/>sonal experience and educational background (3/10).<lb/> Some people got their knowledge from reading (2/10),<lb/> sports coaches (2/10), sales representatives of sports food<lb/> brands (2/10), physicians (1/10) or pharmacists (1/10).<lb/></p>

			<p>The food journals revealed that vitamin and mineral<lb/> supplement intake, and sports food consumption was<lb/> higher than what the interviewed subjects said and re-<lb/>membered (<ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>was below recommended amounts, while protein and fat<lb/> intake were close to the recommended intake; 2) the<lb/> main difference between the participants in the shorter<lb/> and longer races were liquid, supplement and sports<lb/> food intakes; and 3) that knowledge and beliefs about<lb/> pre-race nutrition among these amateur athletes partici-<lb/>pating to extreme endurance events are insufficient or<lb/> incorrect.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is generally believed that high CHO intake to<lb/> optimize glycogen storage is the most specific and im-<lb/>portant recommendation for endurance activity to en-<lb/>sure an appropriate energy supply all along a multi hour<lb/> endurance race <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. The CHO stores (muscle and liver<lb/> glycogen) are limited and need to be regularly refuelled.<lb/> CHO ingestion is thus thought to be very important,<lb/> whether it is to increase glycogen storage before a work-<lb/>out, during a race to avoid hypoglycaemia and to protect<lb/> muscle and liver glycogen stores, or after a race to en-<lb/>sure recovery and optimal glycogen resynthesis <ref type="biblio">[6, 7]</ref>.<lb/> Low muscle glycogen stores during exercise, when ac-<lb/>companied by dropping blood glucose levels can cause<lb/> performance decreases, subjective feelings of low levels<lb/> of energy, sensation of heavy legs, excess fatigue, loss of<lb/> concentration, irritability, dizziness and fainting <ref type="biblio">[7, 24]</ref>.<lb/> So it is important to ensure glycogen store fuelling and<lb/> refuelling and it is better to start a race with full stores<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[6, 7]</ref>, especially since the capacity to eat and process<lb/> food during a race is limited <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>. Current recommenda-<lb/>tions for CHO storage before an endurance race are 10<lb/> to 12 g · kg BW −1 · day −1 , starting 36 to 48 h prior to the<lb/> race <ref type="biblio">[2, 9, 10]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The average CHO consumption in our population was<lb/> less than half (46 ± 13 %) of these recommended levels<lb/> and in fact not even a single participant to our study<lb/> reached them. Given the belief of the interviewed ath-<lb/>letes, that high CHO intake is important prior to such<lb/> endurance events, this finding is surprising and possibly<lb/> suggests lack of understanding of the concept of pre-<lb/>race CHO loading. On the other hand, it may also reflect<lb/> difficulties in reaching the recommended CHO amounts<lb/> just by varying the quantities and proportions of the<lb/> usual dietary components, without using additional spe-<lb/>cific CHO-rich sports food to allow the athletes reaching<lb/> CHO and total energy-intake values closer to the guide-<lb/>lines. Our observations lead us to ask the question<lb/> whether today&apos;s guidelines are adequate for practical use.<lb/> The observed average CHO consumption in our sample<lb/> was so far from the recommendations that it suggests that<lb/> it might have been too difficult for our participants to<lb/> reach the recommendations by consuming twice as much<lb/> CHO as they did, even if it were only during the last 24 to<lb/> 36 h and not during the full 4 days we looked at.<lb/></p>

			<p>For the other macronutrients: fat and proteins, there<lb/> are no specific pre-race recommendations for endurance<lb/> activities, but there are guidelines for athletes in daily<lb/> life. Endurance athletes are advised to consume between<lb/> 1.2 and 1.8 g · kg BW -1 · day −1 of protein <ref type="biblio">[8, 9]</ref> and daily<lb/> fat intake should amount to 20 to 35 % of total energy<lb/> intake <ref type="biblio">[2, 8–10]</ref>. For these nutrients the intakes of the<lb/> subjects complied with the guidelines.<lb/></p>

			<p>Fluid and electrolyte intake are thought to be important<lb/> for performance because dehydration, when exceeding 2-<lb/>3 % of body mass, may cause performance impairment<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>, even though there is on-going debate on this topic<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>. So it is important to start races in euhydration and to<lb/> drink enough and frequently during races <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. Since we<lb/> only have information about pre-race behaviour and have<lb/> no data on habitual fluid intake in our subjects we do not<lb/> know if, according to the recommendations, they in-<lb/>creased their fluid intake prior to the race. Intake was on<lb/> average 2.7 l · day −1 , which is slightly above the recom-<lb/>mendations for habitual daily intake (2.4 l · day −1 ) <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>.<lb/> Also in this case the beliefs of the interviewed ath-<lb/>letes contrast with their behaviour since 9 out of 10<lb/> mentioned the importance of increasing liquid intake<lb/> in the last days prior to a major race but only drank<lb/> an average 2.2 l · day −1 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Although several studies showed that vitamin and/or<lb/> mineral supplementation does not improve performance<lb/> during anaerobic <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>, strength <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>, endurance <ref type="biblio">[28, 29]<lb/></ref> or ultra-endurance <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref> exercise, if the daily diet is<lb/> adequate <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref>, supplement intake remains widespread<lb/> among athletes <ref type="biblio">[30, 32, 33]</ref>. In our population, a third of<lb/> the participants took such supplements. The recommen-<lb/>dation is to abstain from vitamin or mineral supplemen-<lb/>tation if the athlete eats enough and a wide variety of<lb/> food and in the absence of a known deficit <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Addition-<lb/>ally, it is important to be careful and to estimate the<lb/> safety, the efficacy, the potency and the legality of a sup-<lb/>plement before taking it <ref type="biblio">[2, 8–10]</ref>. Besides supplements,<lb/> special sports food consumption was also widespread.<lb/> Endurance athletes mostly consume special CHO drinks,<lb/> gels or bars, which can help reaching the recommenda-<lb/>tions for energy and CHO intake <ref type="biblio">[18, 34]</ref>. But in spite of<lb/> 58 % of the 40 participants using CHO-rich sports food<lb/> or drinks, their CHO intake remained far below the<lb/> recommendations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Digestive comfort is another key variable during en-<lb/>durance events such as multi-hour ski-mountaineering<lb/> races <ref type="biblio">[35, 36]</ref>. Digestive discomfort and gastrointestinal<lb/> distress like cramps, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and diar-<lb/>rhoea are frequently reported during ultra-endurance<lb/> activities, particularly during ultra-marathon running<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[35–37]</ref>. To avoid gastrointestinal distress during racing,<lb/> athletes are advised to avoid dehydration, high-fibre food<lb/> intake, and hypertonic beverages, and to practice their<lb/> planned race nutrition strategies before the actual race<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[36–38]</ref>. It is difficult to say from the food diaries which<lb/> food items were specifically avoided during these 4 days,<lb/> because we do not know the habitual diet of the partici-<lb/>pants, but from the interviews it seemed that mostly red<lb/> meat and other fatty food items were avoided.<lb/></p>

			<p>In general, the athletes seemed to be well aware of the<lb/> importance of pre-race nutrition for performance. The<lb/> participants in the longer race Z placed a more particu-<lb/>lar emphasis on this topic than the participants to the<lb/> shorter race A. They also trained more, used lighter<lb/> racing gear (12.4 ± 2.5 kg vs. 15.4 ± 3.2 kg) and their sup-<lb/>plement and sports food intake was higher. The partici-<lb/>pants in the longer Z race were likely more ambitious<lb/> and experienced athletes, who tried noticeably harder to<lb/> optimize everything for the race. Our finding of lower<lb/> lipid consumption by participants with a higher VO 2 max<lb/> and/or lower body fat percentage, as well as the higher<lb/> energy, CHO and liquid consumption of participants<lb/> with lower body fat percentage also seem in accordance<lb/> with this contention.<lb/></p>

			<p>In spite of the declared importance of adequate nutri-<lb/>tion in preparation of an endurance event, the knowledge<lb/> on this topic was approximate. Half of the interviewed<lb/> participants confused supplementation with sports food;<lb/> all the participants believed that it is good for them to eat<lb/> a lot of pasta during the 4 days preceding the race, but<lb/> rarely spoke about CHO and other CHO sources. More-<lb/>over, it seemed to be difficult for them to explain why they<lb/> choose some food items and avoided others. The overall<lb/> impression was that it rather reflected beliefs than know-<lb/>ledge <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The finding in the interviewed athletes that they under-<lb/> estimated their sports food and supplement intake com-<lb/> pared to the intake reported in the food journals is<lb/> probably partly due to the long period of time between<lb/> the real intake and the interviews. But another important<lb/> reason for this difference is probably the fact that the ath-<lb/> letes did not follow a clear strategy based on solid know-<lb/> ledge. This lack of a clear knowledge and strategy can be a<lb/> reason for the far too low energy and CHO consumption.<lb/></p>		

			<head>Limitations<lb/></head>

			<p>Our results should be interpreted taking into account<lb/> some study limitations. Despite participation of 70 sub-<lb/>jects to the study we obtained only 40 complete food in-<lb/>take diaries that could be analysed of which 25 % was<lb/> discussed in detail during the face-to-face semi-structured<lb/> interviews. The number of observations is therefore lim-<lb/>ited and not necessarily representative for all amateur ath-<lb/>letes participating to the &apos;Patrouille des Glaciers&apos; and<lb/> similar extreme endurance events. Also, the interviews<lb/> were performed two years after the race and obviously<lb/> some detail may have been lost. However, it is unlikely<lb/> that the major individual beliefs changed over these two<lb/> years <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>. The overall strategy, grounded in the personal<lb/> beliefs was probably close to that of race day. Finally, food<lb/> diaries are known to be unreliable with frequent under<lb/> and ill reporting of intake <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>, so that our results should<lb/> be interpreted as semi-quantitative.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>This study about pre-competition nutritional habits and<lb/> beliefs of amateur athletes before a long duration ski-<lb/>mountaineering race showed that: although most of the<lb/> athletes seemed aware of the importance of nutrition for<lb/> endurance sports and specifically before a major race,<lb/> their knowledge was approximate and a clear sound nu-<lb/>tritional strategy was missing. Their average CHO intake<lb/> represented less than half of the recommended intake,<lb/> while energy intake was on average 17 % too low. There<lb/> was no significant difference in the energy and macronu-<lb/>trient intake of the participants in the longer and the<lb/> shorter race, but participants in the longer race drank<lb/> significantly more, used more mineral and vitamin sup-<lb/>plements and more sports food and drinks.<lb/></p>

			<p>Taking into consideration all of these issues, some rec-<lb/>ommendations can be formulated for pre-race nutrition:<lb/></p> 

			<item>1) The athletes should be better informed about<lb/> nutrition to allow them developing an evidence-<lb/>based conscious and reflective feeding strategy.<lb/> </item>

			<item>2) A high priority should be given to CHO intake. The<lb/> amount should be increased with traditional food<lb/> (pasta, rice, bread, etc.), completed with CHO-rich<lb/> sports food and drinks.<lb/> </item>

			<item>3) The chosen pre-race nutritional strategy should be<lb/> experimented before that prior to the actual race<lb/> (e.g. before a hard training period or a less important<lb/> competition) to ensure that it does not cause<lb/> gastrointestinal distress.</item>
