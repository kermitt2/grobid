			<head>1 Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The Solvency II directive (European Directive 2009/138/EC), through the Own Risk<lb/> and Solvency Assessment process, introduces the necessity for an insurance undertak-<lb/>ing to be capable of assessing its regulatory solvency on a continuous yearly basis.<lb/> This continuous compliance requirement is a crucial issue for insurers especially for<lb/> life insurance companies. Indeed, due to the various asset-liability interactions and to<lb/> the granularity of the insured profiles (see e.g. Tosetti et al. <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref> and Petauton <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>), the<lb/> highly-stochastic projections of life insurance liabilities constitute a tricky framework<lb/> for the implementation of this requirement.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In the banking industry the notion of continuous solvency has already been investi-<lb/>gated through credit risk management and credit risk derivatives valuation, considering<lb/> an underlying credit model (see e.g. Jarrow et al. <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> and Lonstaff et al. <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>). The<lb/> notions of ruin and solvency are different in the insurance industry, due in particular to<lb/> structural differences and to the specific Solvency II definitions. In a continuous time<lb/> scheme these have been studied in a non-life ruin theory framework, based on the ex-<lb/>tentions of the Cramr-Lundberg model <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>, see e.g. Pentikinen <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>, Pentikinen et al.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref> and Loisel and Gerber <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. In a life insurance framework, considering more em-<lb/>pirical schemes, closed formulas can be found under strong model assumptions. This<lb/> field has for example been investigated in Bonnin et al. <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref> or Vedani and Virepinte<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. However, all these approaches are based on relatively strong model assumptions.<lb/> Moreover, on a continuous basis the use of such approaches generally faces the prob-<lb/>lem of parameters monitoring and needs adaptations to be extended to the continuous<lb/> compliance framework.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Monitoring a life insurance liabilities is very complex and will have to introduce<lb/> several stability assumptions in order to develop a practical solution. The great time and<lb/> algorithmic complexity to assess the exact value of the Solvency Ratio of an insurance<lb/> undertaking is another great issue. In practice, an only complete solvency assessment<lb/> is required by the directive: the insurance undertakings have to implement a complete<lb/> calculation of their Solvency Capital Requirement and of their eligible own funds at<lb/> the end of the accounting year. We have identified two possibilities to investigated<lb/> in order to implement a continuous compliance tool, either to propose a proxy of the<lb/> Solvency Ratio, easy enough to monitor, or directly to address the solvency state (and<lb/> not the solvency level). This last possibility leading to little information in terms of risk<lb/> measurement we have chosen to consider the first one, based on the actual knowledge<lb/> on the polynomial proxies applied to life insurance Net Asset Value (see e.g. Devineau<lb/> and Chauvigny <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>) and Solvency Ratios (Vedani and Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>), that is to say<lb/> Least Squares Monte Carlo and Curve Fitting.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Throughout Section 2 we lay the foundations of the continuous compliance re-<lb/>quirement adapted to life insurance. We underline and discuss the article designing the<lb/> continuous compliance framework and present the major difficulties to address when<lb/> implementing a monitoring tool. In Section 3 we propose a continuous compliance<lb/> assessment scheme based on a general polynomial proxy methodology. This tool is<lb/> implemented in Section 4, using a Least Squares Monte Carlo approach, on a standard<lb/> life insurance product. The Least Squares Monte Carlo approach is generally preferred,<lb/> in practice, to Curve Fitting because of its &quot; supposed &quot; advantages as soon as a large<lb/> dimension context is concerned, which is the case in our continuous compliance mon-<lb/>itoring scheme. We challenge this hypotheses in Section 5 where we implement both<lb/> methodologies in various dimension frameworks and compared the obtained results.<lb/></p>

			<head>2 Continuous compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>The requirement for continuous compliance is introduced in Article 45(1)(b) of the<lb/> Solvency II Directive <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>: &quot; As part of its risk-management system every insurance<lb/> undertaking and reinsurance undertaking shall conduct its own risk and solvency as-<lb/>sessment. That assessment shall include at least the following: (...) the compliance, on<lb/> a continuous basis, with the capital requirements, as laid down in Chapter VI, Sections<lb/> 4 and 5 &quot; 1 .<lb/></p> 

			<p>In this section, we will first remind briefly what these capital requirements are and<lb/> what they imply in terms of modelling and calculation. We will then discuss continuous<lb/> compliance, what it entails and what issues it brings up for (re)insurance companies.<lb/> Finally we will highlight some key elements to the setting of a continuous compliance<lb/> framework in this business area.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 Capital requirements<lb/> 2.1.1 Regulatory framework<lb/></head>

			<p>The capital requirements laid down in Chapter VI, Sections 4 and 5 are related to the<lb/> Solvency Capital Requirement, or SCR (Section 4), and the Minimum Capital Require-<lb/>ment, or MCR (Section 5).<lb/></p> 

			<p>The SCR corresponds to the Value-at-Risk of the basic own funds of the company<lb/> subject to a confidence level of 99.5% over a one-year period. It has to be calculated<lb/> and communicated to the supervisory authority. Additionally, companies falling within<lb/> the scope of the Financial Stability Reporting will have to perform a quarterly calcu-<lb/>lation (limited to a best effot basis) and to report its results. Companies will have to<lb/> hold eligible own funds higher or equal to the SCR. Failing to do so will trigger a<lb/> supervisory process aiming at recovering a situation where the eligible own funds are<lb/> in excess of the SCR. The SCR can be calculated using the Standard Formula -a set of<lb/> methodological rules set out in the regulatory texts -or an internal model (see below<lb/> for further details).<lb/></p> 

			<p>The MCR is a lower requirement than the SCR , calculated and reported quarterly.<lb/> It can be seen as an emergency floor. A breach of the MCR will trigger a supervisory<lb/> process that will be more severe than in the case of a breach of the SCR and could<lb/> lead to the withdrawal of authorization. The MCR is calculated through a factor-based<lb/> formula. The factors apply to the technical provisions and the written premiums in<lb/> non-life and to the technical provisions and the capital at risk for life business. It is<lb/> subject to an absolute floor and a floor based on the SCR. It is capped at 45% of the<lb/> SCR.<lb/></p>

			<p>This paper focuses on the estimation of the eligible own funds and the SCR. Basi-<lb/>cally, the MCR will not be used as much as the SCR when it comes to risk management,<lb/> and compliance with the SCR will imply compliance with the MCR.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1.2 Implementation for a life company<lb/></head>

			<p>The estimation of the eligible own funds and the SCR requires to carry out calculations<lb/> that can be quite heavy. Their complexity depends on the complexity of the company&apos;s<lb/> portfolio and the modelling choices that are made, in particular between the Standard<lb/> Formula and an internal model. In this section, we present the key issues to be dealt<lb/> with by a life insurer.<lb/> Implementation scheme. To assess the SCR it is necessary to project ecenomic bal-<lb/>ance sheets and calculate best estimates.<lb/> For many companies, the bulk of the balance sheet valuation lies in the estimation<lb/> of these best estimates. This can imply quite a long and heavy process, since the<lb/> assessment is carried out through simulations and is subject, amongst other things, to<lb/> the following constraints:<lb/> </p>

			<item>• updating the assets and liabilities model points;<lb/> </item>

			<item>• constructing a set of economic scenarios under the risk-neutral probability and<lb/> checking its market-consistency;<lb/> </item>

			<item>• calibrating and validating the stochastic model through a series of tests (e.g.:<lb/> leakage test);<lb/> </item>

			<item>• running simulations.<lb/> </item>

			<p>The valuation of the financial assets may also be quite time-consuming if a signifi-<lb/>cant part of the portfolio has to be marked to model.<lb/> SCR calculation through the Standard Formula. The calculation of the SCR through<lb/> the Standard Formula is based on the following steps:<lb/></p> 

			<item>• calculation of the various standalone SCR;<lb/></item>

			<item>• aggregation;<lb/></item> 

			<item>• adjustment for the risk absorbing effect of technical provisions and deferred<lb/> taxes;<lb/></item>

			<item>• calculating and adding up the capital charge for operational risk.<lb/></item> 

			<p>Each standalone SCR corresponds to a risk factor and is defined as the difference<lb/> between the current value of the eligible own funds and their value after a pre-defined<lb/> shock on the risk factor. As a consequence, for the calculation of each standalone SCR<lb/> a balance sheet valuation needs to be carried out, which means that a set of simulations<lb/> has to be run and that the assets must be valued in the economic conditions after shock.<lb/> SCR calculation with a stochastic internal model. An internal model is a model<lb/> designed by the company to reflect its risk profile more accurately than the Standard<lb/> Formula. Companies deciding not to use the Standard Formula have the choice be-<lb/>tween a full internal model and a partial internal model. The latter is a model where<lb/> the capital charge for some of the risks is calculated through the Standard Formula<lb/> while the charge for the other risks is calculated with an entity-specific model. There<lb/> are two main categories of internal models 2 :<lb/></p> 

			<item>• models based on approaches similar to that of the Standard Formula, whereby<lb/> capital charges are calculated on the basis of shocks; the methodology followed<lb/> in this case is the same as the one described in Subsection 2.1. 2;<lb/></item>

			<item>• fully stochastic models: the purpose of this type of model is to exhibit a prob-<lb/>ability distribution of the own funds at the end of a 1-year period, in order to<lb/> subsequently derive the SCR , by calculating the difference between the 99.5%<lb/> quantile and the initial value.<lb/></item>

			<p>In the latter case, the calculations are based on a methodology called Nested Sim-<lb/>ulations. It is based on a twofold process of simulations:<lb/></p>

			<item>• real-world simulations of the risk factors&apos; evolution over 1 year are carried out;<lb/> </item>

			<item>• for each real-world simulation, the balance sheet must be valued at the end of<lb/> the 1-year period. As per the Solvency II requirements, this valuation has to be<lb/> market-consistent. It is carried out through simulations under the risk-neutral<lb/> probability.<lb/></item>

			<p>More details on Nested Simulations can be found in Broadie et al. <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> or Devineau<lb/> and Loisel <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 An approach to continuous compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>In the rest of this article we focus the scope of our study to life insurance.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.1 Defining an approach<lb/></head>

			<p>As mentioned above, the Solvency II Directive requires companies to permanently<lb/> cover their SCR and MCR. This is what we refer to as continuous compliance in this<lb/> paper. The regulatory texts do not impose any specific methodology. Moreover the<lb/> assessment of continuous compliance is introduced as an element of the Own Risk and<lb/> Solvency Assessment (ORSA), which suggests that the approach is for each company<lb/> to define.<lb/> Different approaches can be envisaged. Here below we present some assessment<lb/> methodologies that companies can rely on and may combine in a continuous compli-<lb/>ance framework.<lb/> </p>

			<item>• Full calculations: i.e. the same calculations as those carried out for annual re-<lb/>porting to the supervisory authority: this type of calculations can be performed<lb/> several times during the year. However the process can be heavy and time-<lb/>consuming, as can be seen from the description made in Subsection 2.1.2. As a<lb/> consequence, it seems operationally difficult to carry out such calculations more<lb/> than quarterly (actualy most companies are likely to run full calculations only<lb/> once or twice a year).<lb/></item>

			<item>• Simplified full calculations: companies may decide to run calculations similar<lb/> to those described in the previous item but to freeze some elements. For example<lb/> they could decide not to update the liabilities model points if the portfolio is<lb/> stable and if the time elapsed since the last update is short; they could also decide<lb/> to freeze some modules or sub-modules that are not expected to vary significantly<lb/> over a short period of time.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Proxies: companies may develop methods to calculate approximate values of<lb/> their Solvency Ratio 3 (SR). Possible approaches include, among others, abacuses<lb/> and parametric proxies.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Indicators monitoring: as part of their risk management, companies will moni-<lb/>tor risk indicators and set limits to them. These limits may be set so that respect-<lb/>ing them ensures that some SCR modules stay within a given range.<lb/></item>

			<head>2.2.2 Overview of the proposed approach<lb/></head>

			<p>The approach presented in this paper relies on the calibration of proxies allowing to<lb/> estimate the SR quickly and taking as input a limited number of easy-to-produce indi-<lb/>cators. It has been developed for life companies using the Standard Formula.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Proxies: generic principles. Simplifying the calculations requires limiting the num-<lb/>ber of risks factors that will be monitored and taken into account in the assessment<lb/> to the most significant. For most life insurance companies, these risk factors will be<lb/> financial (e.g.: stock level, yield curve).<lb/></p> 

			<p>In the framework described in the following sections, the proxies are supposed to be<lb/> potentially used to calculate the SR at any point in time. For operational practicality, the<lb/> inputs have to be easily available. In particular, for each risk factor, an indicator will be<lb/> selected for monitoring purpose and to be used as input for the proxy (see Section 3 for<lb/> more insight about proxies). The selected indicators will have to be easily obtainable<lb/> and reflect the company&apos;s risk profile.<lb/></p> 

			<p>As explained in Section 3, our approach relies on the development and the cali-<lb/>bration of proxies in order to calculate in a quick and simple way the company&apos;s Net<lb/> Asset Value (NAV ) and the most significant SCR sub-modules. The overall SCR is then<lb/> calculated through an aggregation process based on the Standard Formula&apos;s structure<lb/> and using the tools the company uses for its regulatory calculations. As a consequence,<lb/> a selection has to be made regarding the sub-modules that will be calculated by proxy.<lb/> The others are frozen or updated proportionally to a volume measure (e.g. mortality<lb/> SCR set proportional to the technical provisions).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1: Continuous compliance framework.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Continuous compliance framework. Under Solvency II, companies will set a fre-<lb/>quency (at least annual) for the full calculation of the SCR 4 . Additionally, they will<lb/> set a list of pre-defined events and circumstances that will trigger a full calculation<lb/> whenever they happen. The proxies will be used to estimate the SR between two full<lb/> calculations and should be calibrated every time a full calculation is performed. This<lb/> process is summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> below.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Here below are a few examples of pre-defined events and circumstance,<lb/></p> 

			<item>• external events (e.g.: financial events, pandemics),<lb/></item> 

			<item>• internal decisions (e.g.: change in asset mix),<lb/></item> 

			<item>• risk factors outside the proxies&apos; zone of validity.<lb/></item>

			<p>3 Quantitative approach to assess the continuous com-<lb/>pliance<lb/></p>

			<p>Note first that the study presented in this paper was carried out in a context where the<lb/> adjustment for the loss-absorbing capacity of technical provisions was lesser than the<lb/> Future Discretionary Benefits ( &quot; FDB &quot; ) (see Level 2 Implementation Measures <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>). As<lb/> a consequence, the Value of In-Force and the NAV were always calculated net of the<lb/> loss-absorbing effect of future profit participation. In cases where the loss-absorbing<lb/> capacity of technical provisions breaches the FDB, further developments (and addi-<lb/>tional assumptions), not presented in this paper, will be necessary.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In Section 3 we present a proxy implementation that enables one to assess the<lb/> continuous compliance, and the underlying assumptions.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1 Assumptions underlying the continuous compliance assessment<lb/> framework<lb/></head>

			<p>As explained in Subsection 2.2.2, several simplifications will be necessary in order to<lb/> operationalize the continuous compliance assessment using our methodology.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.1 Selection of the monitored risks<lb/></head>

			<p>First, we need to assume that the company can be considered subject to a limited num-<lb/>ber of significant and easily measurable risks with little loss of information.<lb/></p>

			<p>In most cases this assumption is quite strong. Indeed, there are numerous underly-<lb/>ing risks for a life insurance undertaking and these are not always easily measurable.<lb/> For example, the mortality and longevity risks, to cite only those, are greatly difficult<lb/> to monitor on an infra-year time step, simply because of the lack of data. Moreover<lb/> the significant aspect will have to be quantifiably justified. For instance, this signifi-<lb/>cance can be defined considering the known impact of the risk on the SCR or on the<lb/> company&apos;s balance sheet, or considering its volatility.<lb/></p> 
			<p>In the case of a life insurance business it seems particularly relevant to select the<lb/> financial risks, easily measurable and monitorable. As a consequence, the selected risk<lb/> will for example be the stock, interest rates (corporate, sovereign), implicit volatilities<lb/> (stock / interest rates), illiquidity premium.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In order to enable a frequent monitoring of the selected risks and of their impact,<lb/> it is necessary to add the assumption that their evolution over time can be satisfy-<lb/>ingly replicated by the evolution of composite indexes defined continuously through<lb/> the monitoring period.<lb/></p> 

			<p>This assumption is a more tangible translation of the measurable aspect of the risks.<lb/> The objective here is to enable the risks&apos; monitoring through reference indexes.<lb/></p> 

			<p>For example, an undertaking which is mainly exposed to European stocks can con-<lb/>sider the EUROSTOXX50 level in order to efficiently synthetize its stock level risk.<lb/> Another possibility may be to consider weighted European stock indexes to obtain an<lb/> aggregated indicator more accurate and representative of the entity-specific risk. For<lb/> example, for the sovereign spread risk, it seems relevant for a given entity to monitor<lb/> an index set up as a weighted average of the spread extracted from the various bonds<lb/> in its asset portfolio.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Eventually, the undertaking must aim at developing a indexes table, similar to the<lb/> following one.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 1: Example of indexes table — Significant risks and their associated indicators.<lb/> Significant risks<lb/> Associated composite indicators<lb/> Stock (level)<lb/> 70% CAC40 / 30% EUROSTOXX50<lb/> Risk-free rate (level) Euro swap curve (averaged level evolution)<lb/> Spread (sovereign)<lb/> Weighted average of the spread by issuing country.<lb/> Weights : % market value in the asset portfolio<lb/> Spread (corporate)<lb/> iTraxx Europe Generic 10Y Corporate<lb/> Volatility (stock)<lb/> VCAC Index<lb/> Illiquidity premium<lb/> Illiquidity premium (see QIS5 formula [7])<lb/> </table>

			<figure>Figure 2: Simplified monitoring framework: Illustration<lb/></figure>

			<p>Generally speaking, all the assumptions presented here are almost induced by the<lb/> operational constraints linked to the definition of the continuous compliance framework<lb/> (full calculation frequence / number of monitores risks). Indeed, it is impossible in<lb/> practice to monitor each underlying risk day by day. We therofore need to restrict the<lb/> framework by selecting the most influent risks and indicators enabling their practical<lb/> monitoring.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In addition, it is irrelevant to consider too stable risks or risks that cannot be mon-<lb/>itored infra-annually. In this case, they can simply be assumed frozen, or updated<lb/> proportionnaly to a volume measure, through the monitoring period, with little loss of<lb/> information.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this simplified framework, a change of the economic conditions over time will<lb/> be summarize in the realized indexes&apos; level transition. It is then possible to build a<lb/> proxy enabling one to approximate quickly the SR at each monitoring date, knowing<lb/> the current level of the composite indicators.<lb/></p> 

			<p><ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the process to follow and the underlying assumptions made in<lb/> a simplified framework. Let us develop a case where the company&apos;s asset portfolio<lb/> can be divided into one stock and one bond pools. Two underlying risks have been<lb/> identified, the stock level risk and the interest rate level risk (average level change of<lb/> the rates curve 5 ). Our assumptions lead to consider that, once the risks associated to<lb/> composite indexes, it is possible to approximate the asset portfolio by a mix between,<lb/></p> 

			<item>• a stock basket with the same returns, composed with the composite stock index<lb/> only (e.g. 70% CAC 40 / 30% EUROSTOXX50),<lb/></item> 

			<item>• a bond basket replicating the cash-flows of the bonds discounted using a rate<lb/> curve induiced from the initial curve translated of the average variation of the<lb/> reference rate curve (the &quot; composite &quot; curve, e.g. the Euro swap curve).<lb/></item>

			<p>Eventually we can decompose the process presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> between,<lb/></p> 

			<item>• a vertical axe where one simplifies the risks themselves,<lb/></item> 

			<item>• and an horizontal axe where one transforms the risk into composite indexes.<lb/></item>

			<p>To conclude, note that the assumptions made here will lead to the creation of a basis<lb/> risk. Indeed, even if the considered indexes are very efficient, one part of the insurance<lb/> portfolio sensitivity will be omitted due to the approximations. In particular the risks<lb/> and indexes must be chosen very precisely, entity-specifically. A small mistake can<lb/> have great repercussions on the approximate SR. In order to minimize the basis risk, the<lb/> undertaking will have to back-test the choices made and the underlying assumptions.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.1.2 Selection of the monitored marginal SCR<lb/></head>

			<p>The continuous compliance framework and tool presented in this paper applies to com-<lb/>panies that use a Standard Formula approach to assess the SCR value (but can provide<lb/> relevant information to companies that use an internal model).<lb/></p> 

			<p>In practice it will not be necessary to monitor every marginal SCR of a company.<lb/> Indeed, some risk modules will be little or not impacted by any infra-annual evolution<lb/> of the selected risks. Moreover, a certain number of sub-modules have a small weight<lb/> in the calculation of the Basic Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR). These too small<lb/> and/or stable marginal SCR will be frozen or updated proportionally to a volume mea-<lb/>sure throughout the monitoring period.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Eventually, the number of risk modules that will have to be updated precisely (the<lb/> most meaningful marginal SCR) should be reduced to less than ten. Note that, among<lb/> the marginal SCR to recalculate, some can correspond to modeled risks factors but<lb/> others will not correspond to the selected risk factors while being very impacted by<lb/> those (e.g. the massive lapse SCR).<lb/></p> 

			<p>This selection of the relevant SCR sub-modules will introduce a new assumption<lb/> and a new basis risk, necessary for our methodology&apos;s efficiency. The basis risk associ-<lb/>ated to this assumption, linked to the fact that some marginal SCR will not be updated at<lb/> each monitoring date, can be reduced by considering a larger number of sub-modules.<lb/> One will have to apprehend this problem pragmatically, to take a minimal number of<lb/> risk modules into account in order to limit the number of future calculations, while<lb/> keeping the error made on the overall SCR under control, the best possible way.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 Use of parametric proxies to assess the continuous compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>In the previous section we have defined a reference framework in which we will de-<lb/>velop our monitoring tool. The proposed methodology aims at calibrating proxies that<lb/> replicate the central and shocked NAV as functions of the levels taken by the chosen<lb/> indexes.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1 Assumption of stability of the asset and liability portfolios<lb/></head>

			<p>We now work with closed asset and liabities potfolios, with no trading, claim or pre-<lb/>mium cash-flow, in order to consider a stable asset-mix and volume of assets and lia-<lb/>bilities. Eventually, all the balance sheets movements are now induced by the financial<lb/> factors.<lb/></p>

			<p>This new assumption may seem strong at first sight. However, it seems justified<lb/> on a short term period. In the general case the evolution of these portfolios is slow<lb/> for mature life insurance companies. This evolution is therefore assumed to have little<lb/> significance for the monitoring period of our continuous compliance monitoring tool.<lb/> Eventually, if a significant evolution happens in practice (e.g. a portfolio puchase / sale)<lb/> this will lead to a full recalibration of the tool (see Subsection 4.2.3 for more insight on<lb/> the monitoring tool governance).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2 Economic transitions<lb/></head>

			<p>Let us recall the various assumptions considered until now.<lb/></p> 

			<item>• H1 : The undertaking&apos;s underlying risks can be summarized into a small pool of<lb/> significant and easily quantifiable risks with little loss of information.<lb/></item>

			<item>• H2 : The evolution of these risks can be perfectly replicated by monitoring com-<lb/>posite indicators, well defined at each date of the monitoring period.<lb/></item> 

			<item>• H3 : The number of marginal SCR that need to be precisely updated at each<lb/> monitoring date can be reduced to the most impacting risk modules with little<lb/> loss of information.<lb/></item>

			<item>• H4 : The asset and liability portfolio are assumed frozen between two calibration<lb/> dates of the monitoring tool.<lb/></item>

			<p>Under the assumptions H1, H2, H3 and H4 it is possible to summarize the im-<lb/>pact of a time evolution of the economic conditions on the considered portfolio into<lb/> an instant level shock of the selected composite indicators. This instant choc will be<lb/> denoted &quot; economic transition &quot; and we will see below that it can be identified to a set<lb/> of elementary risk factors similar to those presented in Devineau and Chauvigny <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<figure>Figure 3: Economic transition &quot; 0 → 0 + &quot; .<lb/> </figure>

			<p>Let us consider a two shocks framework: the stock level risk, associated to an index<lb/> denoted by S(t) at date t ≥ 0 (t = 0 being the tool&apos;s calibration date) and an interest<lb/> rate level risk, associated to zero-coupon prices, denoting by P(t, m) the zero-coupon<lb/> of maturity m and date t ≥ 0. Now, let us consider an observed evolution between 0 and<lb/> a monitoring date t &gt; 0. Finaly, to calculate the NAV at date t, under our assumptions,<lb/> it is only necessary to know the new levels S(t), P(t, m).<lb/></p> 

			<p>The real evolution, from<lb/> S(0), (P(0, m)) m∈1;M<lb/> to<lb/> S(t), (P(t, m)) m∈1;M<lb/> can<lb/> eventually be seen as a risk factors couple,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ε =<lb/> s ε = ln<lb/> S(t)<lb/> S(0)<lb/> , ZC ε = −<lb/> 1<lb/> M<lb/> M<lb/> ∑<lb/> m=0<lb/> ln<lb/> 1<lb/> m<lb/> P(t, m)<lb/> P(0, m)<lb/> ,<lb/></formula>

			<p>denoting by s ε (respectively ZC ε) the stock (resp. zero-coupon) risk factor.<lb/> This evolution of the economic conditions, translated into a risk factors tuple, is<lb/> called economic transition in the following sections of this paper and can easily be<lb/> extended to a greater number of risks. The risk factor will be used in our algorithm<lb/> to replicate the instant shocks &quot; 0 → 0 + &quot; equivalent to the real transitions &quot; 0 → t &quot; .<lb/> Moreover, the notion of economic transition will be used to designate either an instant<lb/> shock or a real evolution of the economic situation between 0 and t &gt; 0. In this latter<lb/> case we will talk about real or realized economic transition.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3 Probable space of economic transitions for a given α% threshold<lb/></head>

			<p>Let us consider, for example, a 3-months monitoring period (with a full calibrations<lb/> of the monitoring tool at the start and at the end of the period). It is possible to a<lb/> priori assess a probable space of the probable quarterly economic transitions, under<lb/> the historic probability P and for a given threshold α%. One simply has to study a<lb/> deep enough historical data summary of the quarterly evolutions of the indexes and<lb/> to assess the interval between the 1−α%<lb/> 2<lb/> and the 1+α%<lb/> 2<lb/> historical quantiles of the risk<lb/> factors extracted from the historical data set.<lb/></p> 
			<p>For example, for the stock risk factor s ε, knowing the historical summary<lb/> S i<lb/> 4<lb/> i∈0,4T +1<lb/> one can extract the risk factor&apos;s historical data set<lb/> </p>

				<formula>s ε i<lb/> 4<lb/> = ln<lb/> S i+1<lb/> 4<lb/> S i<lb/> 4<lb/> i∈0,4T<lb/></formula>

			<p>and ob-<lb/>tain the probable space of economic transitions for a given α% threshold,<lb/></p>

				<formula>q 1−α%<lb/> 2<lb/> s ε i<lb/> 4<lb/> i∈0;4T<lb/> ; q 1+α%<lb/> 2<lb/> s ε i<lb/> 4<lb/> i∈0;4T<lb/> .<lb/></formula>

			<p>In a more general framework, consider economic transitions represented by J-<lb/>tuples of risk factors ε =<lb/> 1 ε, ..., J ε<lb/> of which one can get an historical summary<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.4 Implementation — Replication of the central NAV<lb/></head> 

			<p>We will now assume that J different risks have already been selected.<lb/></p>

			<p>The implementation we will now descibe aims at calibrating a polynomial proxy<lb/> that replicates NAV 0 + (ε), the central NAV at the date t = 0 + , associated to an eco-<lb/>nomic transition ε =<lb/> 1 ε, ..., J ε<lb/> . The proxy will allow, at each monitoring date t, after<lb/> evaluating the observed economic transition ε t (realized between 0 and t), to obtain a<lb/> corresponding approximate central NAV value,  NAV proxy<lb/> 0 +<lb/> (ε t ).<lb/></p>

			<p>Notation and preliminary definitions. To build the NAV proxy<lb/>0 +<lb/>(ε) function, our ap-<lb/>proach is inspired from the Curve Fitting (CF) and Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSMC)<lb/> polynomial proxies approaches proposed in Vedani and Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>. It is possible<lb/> to present a generalized implementation plan for these kinds of approaches. They both<lb/> aim at approximating the NAV using a polynomial function whose monomials are sim-<lb/>ple and crossed powers of the elements in ε =<lb/> 1 ε, ..., J ε<lb/> .<lb/></p> 

			<p>Let us introduce the following notation. Let Q be a risk-neutral measure condi-<lb/>tioned by the real-world financial information known at date 0 + , F 0 + the filtration that<lb/> characterizes the real-world economic information contained within an economic tran-<lb/>sition between dates 0 and 0 + . Let R u be the profit realized between u − 1 and u ≥ 1,<lb/> and δ u the discount factor at date u ≥ 1 . Let H be the liability run-off horizon.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The gist of the method is described here below.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The NAV 0 + (ε) depends on the economic information through the period [0; 0 + ],<lb/> </p>

				<formula>NAV 0 + (ε) = E Q<lb/> ∑ H<lb/> t=1 δ t R t |F 0 +<lb/> .<lb/></formula>

			<p>For a given transition ε it is possible to estimate NAV 0 + (ε) implementing a standard<lb/> Asset Liability Management model calculation at date t = 0 + . In order to do so one<lb/> must use an economic scenarios table of P simulations generated under the probability<lb/> measure Q between t = 0 + and t = H initialized by the levels (and volatilities if the<lb/> risk is chosen) of the various economic drivers as induced by transition ε.<lb/></p>

			<p>For each simulation p ∈ 1; P and date t ∈ 1; H, one has to calculate the profit<lb/> outcome R p<lb/> t using an Asset-Liability Management (ALM) model and, knowing the<lb/> corresponding discount factor δ p<lb/> t , to assess the Monte Carlo estimator,<lb/></p>

				<formula>NAV 0 + (ε) = 1<lb/> P ∑ P<lb/> p=1 ∑ H<lb/> t=1 δ p<lb/> t R p<lb/> t .<lb/></formula>

			<p>When P = 1 we obtain an inefficient estimator of NAV 0 + (ε) which we will denote<lb/> by NPV 0 + (ε) (Net Present Value of margins), according to the notation of Vedani and<lb/> Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>. Note that for a given transition ε, NPV 0 + (ε) is generally very volatile<lb/> and it is necessary to have P high to get an efficient estimator of NAV 0 + (ε).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Methodology. Let us consider a set of N transitions obtained randomly from a proba-<lb/>ble space of economic transitions and denoted by<lb/> ε n =<lb/> 1 ε n , ..., J ε n<lb/> n ∈ 1;N<lb/> . We now<lb/> have to aggregate all the N associated risk-neutral scenarios tables, each one initialized<lb/> by the drivers&apos; levels (and volatilities if needed) corresponding to one of the economic<lb/> transitions in the set, in a unique table (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5: Aggregate table.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The ALM calculations launched on such a table enables one to get N × P outcomes<lb/></p>

				<formula>NPV p<lb/> 0 + (ε n )<lb/> n∈1;N,p∈1;P<lb/> ,<lb/></formula> 

			<p>and subsequently a N sample<lb/></p> 

				<formula>NAV 0 + (ε n ) =<lb/> 1<lb/> P<lb/> P<lb/> ∑<lb/> p=1<lb/> NPV p<lb/> 0 + (ε n )<lb/> n∈1;N<lb/> .<lb/></formula> 

			<p>Then, the outcomes<lb/></p> 

				<formula>NAV 0 + (ε n )<lb/> n∈1;N<lb/></formula>

			<p>are regressed on simple and crossed<lb/> monomials of the risk factors in ε =<lb/> 1 ε, ..., J ε<lb/> . The regression is made by Ordinary<lb/> Least Squares (OLS) and the optimal regressors x =<lb/> Intercept, 1 X, ..., K x<lb/> (with, for all<lb/> k ∈ 1; K, k x = ∏ J<lb/> j=1<lb/> j ε k α j , for a certain J-tuple (α 1 , ..., α J ) in N J ) are selected using<lb/> a stepwise methodology. For more developments about these approaches see Draper<lb/> and Smith <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref> or Hastie et al. <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Let β =<lb/> Int β , 1 β , ..., K β<lb/> be the optimal multilinear regression parameters.<lb/></p>

			<p>The considered multilinear regression can therefore be written under a matricial<lb/> form Y = Xβ +U, denoting by<lb/></p>

				<formula>Y =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> NAV 0 +<lb/> ε 1<lb/> . . .<lb/> NAV 0 +<lb/> ε N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  ,<lb/> X =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> x 1<lb/> . . .<lb/> x N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  ,<lb/> </formula>

			<p>with, for all n ∈ 1; N,</p> 

				<formula>x n =<lb/> 1, 1 x n , ..., K x n<lb/> , for all k ∈ (|1; K|), k x n = ∏ J<lb/> j=1<lb/> j ε n α j<lb/> and U = Y − Xβ .<lb/></formula>

			<p>In this regression, the conditional expectation of NAV 0 + (ε n ) given the σ -field gen-<lb/>erated by the regressors matrix X is simply seen as a linear combination of the regres-<lb/>sors. For more insight about multiple regression models the reader may consult Saporta<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The underlying assumption of this model can also be written</p>  

				<formula>∃β , E [Y |X] = Xβ .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Under the assumption that X X is invertible (with Z the transposition of a given<lb/> vector or matrix Z), the estimated vector of the parameters is,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ˆ<lb/> β = (X X) −1 X Y.<lb/></formula>

			<p>Moreover, for a given economic transition ¯<lb/> ε and its associated set of optimal regres-<lb/>sors ¯<lb/> x, ¯<lb/> x. ˆ<lb/> β is an unbiased and consistent estimator of </p>

				<formula>E<lb/> NAV 0 + (¯ ε) | ¯<lb/> x<lb/> = E [NAV 0 + (¯ ε) | ¯<lb/> x].<lb/> </formula>

			<p>When σ (x) = F 0 + , which is generally the case in practice, ¯<lb/> x ˆ<lb/> β is an efficient estimator<lb/> of NAV 0 + (ε) and we get an efficient polynomial proxy of the central NAV for every<lb/> economic transition.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Eventually, it is necessary to test the goodness of fit. The idea is now to calculate<lb/> several approximate outcomes of central NAV , associated to an out of sample 6 set of<lb/> economic transition, using a Monte Carlo method on a great number of secondary<lb/> scenarios, and to compare these outcomes to those obtained using the proxy.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.5 Implementation — Replication of the shocked NAV<lb/></head>

			<p>At each monitoring date, we aim at knowing each pertinent marginal SCR value, for<lb/> each chosen risk modules. With the proxy calibrated in the previous section one can<lb/> calculate an approximate value of the central NAV . We now have to duplicate the<lb/> methodology presented in Subsection 3.2.4, adapted for each marginally shocked NAV<lb/> (considering the Standard Formula shocks). 7<lb/></p>

			<p>The implementation is fully similar except the fact that the shocked proxies are<lb/> calibrated on N outcomes of marginally shocked NAV 0 + . Indeed each marginal SCR is<lb/> a difference between the central NAV and a NAV after the application of the marginal<lb/> shock. We therefore need the NAV after shock that takes the conditions associated to<lb/> an economic trasition into account.<lb/></p> 

			<p>This enables one to obtain, for each shock nb i, a set<lb/> NAV shock nb i<lb/></p>

				<formula>0 +<lb/> (ε n )<lb/> n∈1;N<lb/>,<lb/> </formula>

			<p>a new optimal regressors set<lb/> Intercept, 1 x shock nb i , ..., K x shock nb i<lb/> and new optimal pa-<lb/>rameters estimatorsˆβestimatorsˆ estimatorsˆβ shock nb i .<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.6 Practical monitoring<lb/></head>

			<p>Once the methodology has been implemented, the obtained polynomial proxies enable<lb/> one, at each date within the monitoring period, to evaluate the central and shocked NAV<lb/> values knowing the realized economic transition.<lb/></p>

			<p>At each monitoring date t, the process is the following.<lb/></p>

			<item>• Assessment of the realized transition between 0 and t, ˆ<lb/> ε.<lb/></item> 

			<item>• Derivation of the values of the optimal regressors set for each proxy:<lb/></item> 

			<item>– ¯<lb/> x the realized regressors set for the central proxy,<lb/> </item>

			<item>– ¯<lb/> x shock nb 1 , ..., ¯<lb/> x shock nb J the regressors set for the J shocked proxy.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Calculation of the approximate central and shocked NAV levels at date t:<lb/></item>

				<item>– ¯<lb/> x ˆ<lb/> β , the approximate central NAV ,<lb/> </item>

				<item>– ¯<lb/> x shock nb 1 ˆ<lb/> β shock nb i , ..., ¯<lb/> x shock nb J ˆ<lb/> β shock nb J the J approximate shocked NAV .<lb/></item>

			<item>• Calculation of the approximate marginal SCR and, considering frozen values,<lb/> or values that are updated proportionally to a volume measure, for the other<lb/> marginal SCR, Standard Formula aggregation to evaluate the approximate overall<lb/> SCR and SR 8 .<lb/></item>

			<head>3.3 Least-Squares Monte Carlo vs. Curve Fitting — The large di-<lb/>mensioning issue<lb/></head>

			<p>The implementation developed in Subsection 3.2 is an adapted application, generalized<lb/> to the N × P framework, of the polynomial approaches such as LSMC and CF, already<lb/> used in previous studies to project NAV values at t years (t ≥ 1). For more insight<lb/> about these approaches, see for example Vedani and Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>, Algorithmics <ref type="biblio">[1]<lb/></ref> or Barrie &amp; Hibbert <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<p>When P = 1 and N is very large (basically the proxies are calibrated on Net Present<lb/> Values of margins / NPV ), we are in the case of a LSMC approach. On the contrary,<lb/> when N is rather small and P large, we are in the case of a CF approach.<lb/></p>

			<p>Both approaches generally deliver similar results. However the LSMC is often seen<lb/> as more stable than a CF when a large number of regressors are embedded in the<lb/> proxy. This clearly matches the continuous compliance case where the user generally<lb/> considers a larger number of risk factors compared to the usual LSMC methodologies,<lb/> used to accelerate Nested Simulations for example. In our case, this large dimensioning<lb/> issue makes a lot of sense.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In Section 4 we will apply the methodology on four distinct risk factors, the stock<lb/> level risk, the interest rates level risk, the widening of corporates spread and of sovereign<lb/> spread risks. We have chosen to implement this application using a LSMC method. In<lb/> Section 5 we eventually try to challenge the commonly agreed idea that this methodol-<lb/>ogy is more robust than CF in a large dimension context.<lb/></p>

			<head>4 LSMC approach adapted to the continuous compli-<lb/>ance issue<lb/></head>

			<p>In Section 4 we will implement the presented methodology, in a standard savings prod-<lb/>uct framework. The ALM model used for the projections takes profit sharing mech-<lb/>anisms, target crediting rate and dynamic lapses behaviors of policy holders into ac-<lb/>count. Its characteristics are similar to those of the model used in Section 5 of Vedani<lb/> and Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>. The economic assumptions are those of 31/12/2012.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Implementation of the monitoring tool — Initialization step<lb/> and proxies calibration<lb/></head>

			<p>Firstly it is necessary to shape the exact framework of the study. We have to select<lb/> the significant risks to be monitored, to choose representative indexes and then to iden-<lb/>tify the risk modules that will be updated. Note that the other risk modules will be<lb/> considered frozen through the monitoring period.<lb/></p>

			<p>The monitoring period must be chosen short enough to ensure a good validity of<lb/> our stability assumptions for the risk modules that are not updted and for the balance<lb/> sheet composition. However, it also defines the time during two complete proxy cali-<lb/>brations and, as a consequence, it must be chosen long enough not to force too frequent<lb/> calibrations, which are highly time-consuming. In this study we have therefore chosen<lb/> to consider a quarterly monitoring period.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.1 Initialization step — Implementation of a complete regulatory solvency<lb/> calculation<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to quantify the relative relevance of the various marginal SCR of the Standard<lb/> Formula, it is recommended to implement, as a preliminary step, a complete regulatory<lb/> solvency calculation before a calibration of the monitoring tool. Moreover, seen as an<lb/> out of sample scenario, this central calculation can be used as a validation point for the<lb/> calibrated proxies. 9<lb/></p>

			<p>It is also possible to select the marginal SCR based on expert statements or on the<lb/> undertaking&apos;s expertise, knowing the products sensitivities to the various shocks and<lb/> economic cycles at the calibration date (and the previous SCR calculations).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.2 Initialization step — Risk factor and monitored indexes selection<lb/></head>

			<p>We have selected four major risks and built the following indexes table.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 2: Selected risks and associated indicators.<lb/> Selected risks<lb/> Composite indicators<lb/> Stock (level)<lb/> 100% EUROSTOXX50<lb/> Risk-free rate (level) Euro swap curve (averaged level evolution)<lb/> Spread (sovereign)<lb/> Average spread French bonds rate vs. Euro swap rate<lb/> Spread (corporate)<lb/> iTraxx Europe Generic 10Y Corporate<lb/></table>

			<p>These four risks generally have a great impact on the NAV and SCR in the case<lb/> of savings products, even on a short monitoring period. Moreover, they are highly<lb/> volatile at the calibration date (31/12/12). In particular, the division of the spread risk<lb/> in two categories (sovereign and corporate) is absolutely necessary within the European<lb/> sovereign debt context.<lb/> A wide range of risks have been set aside of this study that is just intended to be<lb/> a simple example. In practice both the stock and interest rates implicit volatility risks<lb/> are also relevant risks that can be added in the methodology&apos;s implementation with<lb/> no major issue. For the stock implicit volatility risk it is possible to monitor market<lb/> volatility indexes such as the VIX. Note that the interest rates implicit volatility risk<lb/> raises several questions related to the application of the risk in the instant economic<lb/> transitions, in the calibration scenarios. These issues can be set aside considering re-<lb/>calibration/regeneration approaches (see Devineau <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>) and will not be discussed in this<lb/> paper.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.3 Initialization step — Choice of the monitored marginal SCR<lb/></head>

			<p>Considering the updated risk modules to update, we have chosen the most significant in<lb/> the Standard Formula aggregation process. These are also the less stable trough time,<lb/></p> 

			<item>• the stock SCR,<lb/></item> 

			<item>• the interest rates SCR,<lb/></item> 

			<item>• the spread SCR,<lb/></item> 

			<item>• the liquidity SCR.<lb/></item>

			<p>The lapse risk SCR, generally greatly significant, has not been considered here.<lb/> Indeed with the very low rates, as at 31/12/2012, the lapse risk SCR is close to zero.<lb/> Certain other significant SCR sub-modules such as the real estate SCR have been omit-<lb/>ted because of their low infra-year volatility.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.4 Proxies calibration and validation<lb/></head>

			<p>The calibration of the various proxies is made through the same process as developed<lb/> in Vedani and Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>. The proxy is obtained by implementing a standard OLS<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 3: Market marginal SCR as at 31/12/2012.<lb/> Market SCR<lb/> Value as at 31/12/2012<lb/> IR SCR<lb/> 968<lb/> Stock SCR<lb/> 3930<lb/> Real Estate SCR<lb/> 943<lb/> Spread SCR<lb/> 2658<lb/> Liquidity SCR<lb/> 3928<lb/> Concentration SCR<lb/> 661<lb/> Currency SCR<lb/> 127<lb/> ...<lb/> ...<lb/></table>

			<p>methodology and the optimal regressors are selected through a stepwise approach. This<lb/> enables the process to be completely automated. The validation of each proxy is made<lb/> by considering ten out of the sample scenarios. These are scenarios that have not be<lb/> used to calibrate the proxies but on which we have calculated shocked and central<lb/> outcomes of<lb/> NAV 0 + . These &quot; true &quot; outcomes are then compared to the approximate<lb/> outcomes obtained from our proxies.<lb/></p> 

			<p>To select the out of the sample scenarios we have chosen to define them as the 10<lb/> scenarios that go step by step from the &quot; initial &quot; position to the &quot; worst case &quot; situation<lb/> (the calibrated worst case limit of the monitored risks).<lb/></p>

			<p>For each risk factor ε j ,<lb/> </p>

			<item>• the &quot; initial &quot; position is ε j<lb/> init = 0,<lb/></item> 

			<item>• the &quot; worst case &quot; situation 10 is ε j<lb/> w.c. = q 1−α%<lb/> 2<lb/> ε i<lb/> 4<lb/> i∈0;T<lb/> or q 1+α%<lb/> 2<lb/> ε i<lb/> 4<lb/> i∈0;T<lb/> ,<lb/> depending on the direction of the worst case for each risk,<lb/></item> 

			<item>• the k th (k ∈ 1; 9) out of sample scenario is ε j<lb/> nb. k = k<lb/> 10 ε j<lb/> w.c. + 10−k<lb/> 10 ε j<lb/> init .<lb/></item>

			<p>Below are shown the relative deviations, between the proxies outcomes and the<lb/> corresponding out of sample fully-calculated scenarios, obtained on the first five val-<lb/>idation scenarios. As one can see, the relative deviations are always close to 0 apart<lb/> from the illiquidity shocked NAV proxy. In practice this proxy is the most complex to<lb/> calibrate due to the high volatility of the illiquidity shocked NAV . To avoid this issue,<lb/> the user can add more calibration scenarios or select more potential regressors when<lb/> implementing the stepwise methodology. In our study we have chosen to validate our<lb/> proxy, staying critical on the underlying approximate marginal SCR illiquidity.<lb/></p> 

			<p>All the proxies being eventually calibrated and validated, it is now necessary to<lb/> rebuild the Standard Formula aggregation process in order to assess the approximate<lb/> overall SCR value.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.5 Proxies aggregation through the Standard Formula process<lb/></head>

			<p>In practice the overall SCR is calculated as an aggregation of three quantities, the BSCR,<lb/> the operational SCR (SCRop) and the tax adjustments (Ad j).<lb/></p>

			<p>As far as the BSCR is concerned, no particular issue is raised by its calculation.<lb/> At each monitoring date, the selected marginal SCR are approximated using the prox-<lb/>ies and the other SCR are assumed frozen. The BSCR is simply obtained through a<lb/> Standard Formula aggregation (see for example Devineau and Loisel <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>).<lb/></p> 

			<p>To derive the operational SCR, we consider that this capital is also stable through<lb/> time, which is in practice an acceptable assumption for a halfyearly or quarterly mon-<lb/>itoring period (and consistent with the asset and liability portfolios stability assump-<lb/>tion).<lb/></p> 

			<p>The Tax adjustments approximation leads to the greatest issue. Indeed we need<lb/> to know the approximate Value of In-Force (V IF) at the monitoring date. We obtain<lb/> the approximate V IF as the approximate central NAV<lb/> NAV<lb/> central proxy<lb/> minus a fixed<lb/> amount calculated as the sum of the tier-one own funds (tier one OF) and of the sub-<lb/>ordinated debt (SD) minus the financial management fees (FMF), as at the calibration<lb/> date. Let t be the monitoring date and 0 be the proxies&apos; calibration date (t &gt; 0),<lb/></p>

				<formula>V IF t ≈ NAV central proxy<lb/> t<lb/> − (tier one OF 0 + SD 0 − FMF 0 ).<lb/></formula>

			<p>Assuming a frozen corporation tax rate of 34.43% (French corporation tax rate),<lb/> the approximated level of deferred tax liability<lb/> DT L is obtained as,<lb/></p>

				<formula>DT L t = 34.43% ×<lb/> V IF t .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Eventually, the income tax recovery associated to new business<lb/> IT R NB<lb/> is as-<lb/>sumed frozen through the monitoring period and the approximate tax adjustments at<lb/> the monitoring date is obtained as,<lb/></p>

				<formula>Ad j t = IT R NB<lb/> 0 +<lb/> DT L t .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Knowing the approximate values<lb/> BSCR t and<lb/> Ad j t , and the initial value SCRop 0 ,<lb/> one can obtain the approximate overall SCR (simply denoted by<lb/> SCR) at the monitoring<lb/> date as,<lb/></p>

				<formula>SCR t =<lb/> BSCR t + SCRop 0 −<lb/> Ad j t .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Eventually, in order to obtain the SR approximation we obtain the approximate<lb/> eligible own funds<lb/> OF as, OF t = (tier one OF 0</p>

				<formula>+ SD 0 − FMF 0 ) +<lb/> V IF t × (1 − 34.43%).<lb/></formula>

			<p>Eventually, the approximate SR at the monitoring date is,<lb/> </p>

				<formula>SR t =<lb/> OF t<lb/> SCR t<lb/> .<lb/></formula>

			<head>4.2 Practical use of the monitoring tool<lb/></head>

			<p>In subsection 4.2 we will first see the issues raised by the practical continuous compli-<lb/>ance&apos;s monitoring through our tool, and the tool&apos;s governance. In a second part we will<lb/> develop the other possible uses of the monitoring tool, especially in the area of the risk<lb/> management and for the development of preventive measures.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.1 Monitoring the continuous compliance<lb/></head>

			<p>At each monitoring date the process to assess the regulatory compliance is the same as<lb/> presented in Subsection 3.2.6.<lb/></p>

			<item>• Assessment of the realized transition between 0 and t, ˆ<lb/> ε.<lb/></item> 

			<item>• Derivation of the values of the optimal regressors set for each proxy.<lb/></item> 

			<item>• Derivation of the values of the optimal regressors set for each proxy.<lb/></item> 

			<item>• Calculation of the approximate central and shocked NAV levels at date t.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Calculation of the levels of each approximate marginal SCR at date t (the other<lb/> marginal SCR are assumed frozen through the monitoring period).<lb/></item> 

			<p>This, with other stability assumptions such as stability of the tax rate and of the<lb/> tier-one own funds, enables one to reconstruct the Basic SCR, the operational SCR and<lb/> the Tax adjustments and, eventually, to approximate the overall SCR and the SR at the<lb/> monitoring date.<lb/></p>

			<p>Note that this process can be automated to provide a monitoring target such as the<lb/> one depicted below and a set of outputs such as the eligible own funds, the overall SCR,<lb/> the SR, but also the various marginal SCR (see <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2.2 Monitoring the daily evolution of the SR<lb/></head>

			<p>In practice the ability to monitor the SR day by day is very interesting and provides a<lb/> good idea of the empirical volatility of such a ratio (see <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).<lb/></p> 

			<p>In particular, in an ORSA framework it could be relevant to consider an artificially<lb/> smoothed SR, for example using a 2-week moving average, in order to depict a more<lb/> consistent solvency indicator. Considering the same data as presented in the previous<lb/> figure we would obtain the following two graphs (see <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>).<lb/></p> 

			<figure>Figure 6: Target used to monitor the evolution of the risk factors<lb/></figure> 

			<figure>Figure 7: Monitoring of the approximate SR and of the four underlying risk factors,<lb/> from 30/06/12 to 30/06/13.<lb/></figure>

			<head>4.2.3 Monitoring tool governance<lb/></head>

			<p>Several assumptions are made to provide the approximate SR but we can observe in<lb/> practice a good replication of the risk impacts and of the SR variations. However the<lb/> use of this monitoring tool only provides a proxy and therefore the results must be used<lb/></p> 

			<figure>Figure 8: Comparison of the standard approximate SR and of a smoothed approximate<lb/> SR -Monitoring from 30/06/12 to 30/06/13.<lb/> </figure>

			<p>with caution and its governance must be managed very carefully.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The governance of the tool can be divided into three parts.<lb/></p> 

			<item>• Firstly it is necessary to a priori define the recalibration frequency. The monitor-<lb/>ing period associated to each total calibration of the tool should not be too long.<lb/> The authors believe it should not exceed half a year.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Secondly it is important to identify clearly the data to update for each recalibra-<lb/>tion. These data especially cover the asset and liability data.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Finally the user must define the conditions leading to a total (unplanned) recal-<lb/>ibration of the tool. In particular, these conditions must include updates follow-<lb/>ing management decisions (financial strategy changes inside the mode, asset mix<lb/> changes,...) and updates triggered by the evolution of the economic situation.<lb/></item>

			<head>4.2.4 Alternative uses of the tool<lb/></head>

			<p>This monitoring tool enables the risk managers to run a certain number of studies, even<lb/> at the beginning of the monitoring period, in order ton anticipate the impact of future<lb/> risk deviations for example.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Sensitivity study and stress testing. The parametric proxy that replicates the central<lb/> NAV can also be used to stress the marginal and joint sensitivities of the NAV to the<lb/> various risks embedded in our proxies. Even more interesting for the risk managers,<lb/> it is possible to assess a complete sensitivity study directly on the SR of the company,<lb/> which is very difficult to compute without using an approximation tool (see <ref type="figure">Figures 9<lb/> and 10</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>This sensitivity analyses needs no additional calculations to the proxies&apos; assess-<lb/>ment and enables the risk managers to compute as many &quot; approximate &quot; stress tests as<lb/> needed. In practice such a use of the tool enables to gain better insight about the impact<lb/> of each risk, taken either individually or jointly, on the SR.<lb/></p>

Using<lb/> our monitoring tool it is possible to trace the evolution of the SR risk after risk (only<lb/> for the monitored risks). <ref type="figure">Figures 11 and 12</ref> correspond to a ficticious evolution of the<lb/> risks implemented between the calibration date and a &quot; virtual &quot; monitoring date).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Such a study can be run at each monitoring date, or on fictitious scenarios (e.g. mar-<lb/>ket anticipations), in order to provide better insight about the SR movements through<lb/> time.<lb/></p>

			<p>In particular, such a study can be relevant to<lb/> propose quantitative preventive measures.<lb/> In practice it also seems possible for the user to add asset-mix weights in the moni-<lb/>tored risk factors set. This would enable the user to a priori test asset-mix rebalancing<lb/> possibilities in order to select specific preventive measures and prevent the worse mar-<lb/>ket anticipation. This implementation has not been done yet but will be part of the<lb/> major future developments of the monitoring tool.<lb/></p>

			<head>5 Empirical comparison between LSMC and CF<lb/></head>

			<p>In Section 5 we will try to challenge the generally agreed idea that the LSMC method-<lb/>ology is more robust than CF in a large dimension context. We will also consider<lb/> the various possibilities to build asymptotic confidence intervals for the obtained NAV<lb/> estimators using our polynomial proxies.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1 Mathematical formalism — Probabilistic vs. statistic frame-<lb/>work<lb/></head>

			<p>Through Subsection 5.1, we intend to describe a general polynomial proxy framework,<lb/> calibrated at a given date t (t ≥ 1 as in Vedani and Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref> for example, but also<lb/> t = 0 + which is the case in the framework developed and implemented in Sections 3<lb/> and 4). We will then discriminate two distinct regressions (LSMC and CF) that can be<lb/> apprehended in a probabilistic or a statistic framework.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a probabilistic framework, we note NAV t the Net Asset Value at date t, NPV t the<lb/> Net present Value of margins variable seen at date t and<lb/> NAV t the estimated variable<lb/> considered in the CF regression. These variables are P ⊗ Q t -measurable, denoting by<lb/> P ⊗ Q t the probability measure as introduced in Section 4 of Vedani and Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>.<lb/> The indexation by P ⊗ Q t will be omitted for the sake of simplicity. Finally, we note<lb/> F RW<lb/> t<lb/> the filtration that characterizes the real-world economic information contained<lb/> between 0 and t, R u the profit realized between dates u − 1 and u ≥ 1, and δ u the<lb/> discount factor at date u.<lb/></p>

			<p>We have,<lb/></p> 

			<formula>NPV t = ∑ t+H<lb/> u=1<lb/> δ u<lb/> δ t<lb/> R u<lb/> </formula>

			<p>and denoting NPV 1<lb/> t , ..., NPV P<lb/> t , P i.i.d. random variables conditionally to F RW<lb/> t ,<lb/> which follow the same probability distribution as NPV t , conditionnaly to F RW<lb/> t ,<lb/></p> 

			<formula>NAV t = 1<lb/> P ∑ P<lb/> p=1 NPV p<lb/> t ,<lb/></formula> 

			<p>for a chosen P number of secondary scenarios. Moreover,<lb/></p> 

			<formula>NAV t = E<lb/> NAV t |F MR<lb/> t<lb/> = E<lb/> NPV t |F MR<lb/> t<lb/> .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Denoting by x t the chosen regressors random vector (intercept included), 1 β (resp.<lb/> 2 β ) the true value of the CF (resp. LSMC) regression parameters, and 1 u t (resp. 2 u t )<lb/> the residual of the CF (resp. LSMC) regression, both considered regressions can be<lb/> written as follow.<lb/></p>

			<formula>(regression 1 −CF)<lb/> NAV t = x t<lb/> 1 β + 1 u t<lb/> under the assumption E<lb/> NAV t |x t<lb/> = x t<lb/> 1 β<lb/> (regression 2 − LSMC) NPV t = x t<lb/> 2 β + 2 u t under the assumption E [NPV t |x t ] = x t<lb/> 2 β<lb/></formula>

			<p>Note that this probabilist framework is the one chosen in Monfort <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Moreover, as seen in Vedani and Devineau <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref> and Kalberer <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>, we have 1 β = 2 β<lb/> (= β , in the rest of this paper).<lb/></p> 

			<p>In a statistical framework one will first consider the samples used for the model<lb/> calibration. As a consequence, let 1 N (resp. 2 N) be the length of the calibration<lb/> sample used in a CF (resp. LSMC) regression,<lb/> 1 x n<lb/> t<lb/> n∈1; 1 N<lb/> (resp.<lb/> 2 x n<lb/> t<lb/> n∈1; 2 N<lb/> )<lb/> the x t outcomes,<lb/> NAV<lb/> n<lb/> t<lb/> n∈1; 1 N<lb/> (resp. (NPV n<lb/> t ) n∈1; 2 N ) the associated<lb/> NAV t (resp.<lb/> NPV t ) outcomes 11 and<lb/> 1 u n<lb/> t<lb/> n∈1; 1 N<lb/> (resp.<lb/> 2 u n<lb/> t<lb/> n∈1; 2 N<lb/> the associated residuals. Note<lb/> that in order to compare the relative efficiency of both approaches we will obviously<lb/> have to consider an equal algorithmic complexity of the two approaches, which means<lb/> 2 N = 1 N × P.<lb/></p>

			<p>In a statistical matrix framework we have,<lb/></p>

				<formula>(regression 1 −CF) 1 Y t = 1 X t<lb/> 1 β + 1 U t<lb/> under the assumption E<lb/> 1 Y t | 1 X t<lb/> = 1 X t<lb/> 1 β<lb/> (regression 2 − LSMC) 2 Y t = 2 X t<lb/> 2 β + 2 U t under the assumption E<lb/> 2 Y t | 2 X t<lb/> = 2 X t<lb/> 2 β<lb/> </formula>

			<p>Denoting,<lb/></p> 

				<formula>1<lb/> Y t =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> NAV<lb/> 1<lb/> t<lb/> . . .<lb/> NAV<lb/> 1 N<lb/> t<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  and 2 Y t =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> NPV 1<lb/> t<lb/> . . .<lb/> NPV<lb/> 2 N<lb/> t<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  ,<lb/> 1<lb/> X t =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 1 x 1<lb/> t<lb/> . . .<lb/> 1 x<lb/> 1 N<lb/> t<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  and 2 X t =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 2 x 1<lb/> t<lb/> . . .<lb/> 2 x<lb/> 2 N<lb/> t<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  ,<lb/> 1<lb/> U t =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 1 u 1<lb/> t<lb/> . . .<lb/> 1 u<lb/> 1 N<lb/> t<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  and 2 U t =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 2 u 1<lb/> t<lb/> . . .<lb/> 2 u<lb/> 2 N<lb/> t<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  .<lb/></formula>

			<p>For example, this statistical framework is the one developed in Crpon and Jacquemet<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<p>As the study goes forward and for the sake of simplicity, the time index will be<lb/> omitted.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Comparison tools in a finite sample framework<lb/></head>

			<p>In Subsection 5.2 we determine comparison elements to challenge the comparative<lb/> efficiency of the CF and LSMC estimators, based on standard finite sample econometric<lb/> results. We will see below that, in the general case, it is necessary to study first the<lb/> properties of the residuals covariance matrices. Note that we will now consider the<lb/> regressions in a statistical vision, more representative of the finite sample framework,<lb/> and two assumptions will be made, which are verified in pratice.<lb/></p>

				<formula>H 0 : The<lb/> NAV<lb/> i<lb/> , 1 x i<lb/> (resp. (NPV i , 2 x i )) outcomes are i.i.d.<lb/> </formula>

				<formula>H 1 : The matrix 1 X 1 X (resp. 2 X 2 X) is invertible.<lb/></formula>

			<p>Under these assumptions, the OLS parameters estimators are respectively,<lb/></p>

				<formula>1 ˆ<lb/> β =<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1 1 X 1 Y<lb/> and 2 ˆ<lb/> β =<lb/> 2 X 2 X<lb/> −1 2 X 2 Y<lb/></formula>

			<p>These two estimators are consistent and unbiased.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the following subsections we will introduce two comparison tools for the LSMC<lb/> and CF methodologies in a finite sample framework: estimators of the parameters<lb/> covariance matrices and asymptotic confidence intervals.<lb/></p> 

			<p>As far as the estimated covariance matrices are concerned, it is complicated to use<lb/> them to compare models exept when the eigenvalues of one matrix are all inferior to<lb/> the eigenvalues of the other one. In this case the partial order on the hilbertian matrices<lb/> tells us that the methodology leading to the first matrix is better (see Horn and Johnson<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> for more insight). However, this seldom happens in practice.<lb/></p>

			<p>As far as the asymptotic confidence intervals are concerned, we are able to compare<lb/> the length of these intervals, obtained on the same set of primary scenarios, for thê<lb/> β<lb/> estimated with the two different methodologies. If one methodology leads to smaller<lb/> lengths than the other, it is the better one. This is the approach we will use in our<lb/> empirical tests.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.1 Estimators covariance matrices under an homoskedasticity assumption<lb/></head>

			<p>In Subsection 5.2.1 we add an homoskedasticity assumption for the residuals of both<lb/> models,<lb/></p>

				<formula>H 2 : V<lb/> 1 U| 1 X<lb/> = 1 σ 2 .I1 N and V<lb/> 2 U| 2 X<lb/> = 2 σ 2 .I2 N ,<lb/></formula>

			<p>denoting by I N the identity matrix with rank N.<lb/></p> 

			<p>H 2 can be operationally tested using an homoskedasticity test such as the Breusch<lb/> and Pagan <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>, the White <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref> or the Goldfeld — Quandt <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref> test. This assumption<lb/> makes the Gauss — Markov theorem applicable (see Plackett <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>) and the OLS esti-<lb/>mators are the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE). This means that considering<lb/> the same calibration samples it is impossible to find less volatile estimators than the<lb/> OLS ones. Under this assumption it is also easy to assess the estimators&apos; covariance<lb/> matrices, conditionally to the explicative variables,<lb/></p>

				<formula>V<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> =<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1 1 X V<lb/> 1 Y | 1 X<lb/> 1 X<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1 ,<lb/> V<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> =<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1 1 X V<lb/> 1 U| 1 X<lb/> 1 X<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1 ,<lb/> V<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> = 1 σ 2 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1 .<lb/> </formula>

			<p>And, similarly,</p> 

				<formula>V<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> = 2 σ 2 2 X 2 X<lb/> −1 .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Moreover, we can express consistent and unbiased estimators of 1 σ 2 and 2 σ 2 . Let<lb/> K + 1 be the dimention of x, these estimators are respectively,<lb/></p>

				<formula>1 ˆ<lb/> σ 2 =<lb/> 1<lb/> 1 N−K−1 ∑<lb/> 1 N<lb/> n=1<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> u n 2 and 2 ˆ<lb/> σ 2 =<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 N−K−1 ∑<lb/> 2 N<lb/> n=1<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> u n 2 ,<lb/></formula>

			<p>with 1 ˆ<lb/> u n =<lb/> NAV<lb/> n − 1 x n1ˆβn1ˆ n1ˆβ and 2 ˆ<lb/> u n = NPV n − 2 x n2ˆβn2ˆ n2ˆβ , the empirical residuals of regres-<lb/>sions 1 and 2.<lb/></p>

			<p>We therefore get two unbiased estimators of the previously given conditional co-<lb/>variance matrices,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ˆ<lb/> V<lb/> 1 β | 1 X<lb/> = 1 ˆ<lb/> σ 2 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1 andˆVandˆ andˆV<lb/> 2 β | 2 X<lb/> = 2 ˆ<lb/> σ 2 2 X 2 X<lb/> −1 .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Eventually we have the two following convergences in distribution,<lb/></p>

				<formula>V<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> and V<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Moreover, using the previously given estimators and adding simple assumptions on<lb/> the first moments of the regressors (generally verified in practice), we have,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ˆ<lb/> V<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> andˆVandˆ andˆV<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> .<lb/></formula>

			<head>5.2.2 Comparison between the estimators covariance matrices without the ho-<lb/>moskedasticity assumption<lb/></head>

			<p>In practice it is unusual to observe homoskedastic residuals. We now suppress H 2 in<lb/> order to consider a more robust framework. Note first that, in the heteroskedastic case,<lb/> the OLS estimators are no longer the BLUE.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Moreover, in this new framework we do not have a simple form for the estimators&apos;<lb/> covariance matrices any more,<lb/></p>

				<formula>V<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> =<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1 1 X V<lb/> 1 U| 1 X<lb/> 1 X<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1<lb/> andV<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> =<lb/> 2 X 2 X<lb/> −1 2 X V<lb/> 2 U| 2 X<lb/> 2 X<lb/> 2 X 1 X<lb/> −1 .<lb/></formula>

			<p>However, we still have the two following convergences in distribution,<lb/></p>

				<formula>V<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> and V<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/></formula>

			<p>White <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref> proposes the use of a biased estimator of the residuals variance, in<lb/> the case of independent calibration samples. In our case, it aims at resorting to the<lb/> following estimators,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ˆ<lb/> V<lb/> 1 U| 1 X<lb/> =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> u 1 2 · · ·<lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> . . .<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> · · · 1 ˆ<lb/> u<lb/> 1 N<lb/> 2<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  andˆVandˆ andˆV<lb/> 1 U| 1 X<lb/> =<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> u 1 2 · · ·<lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> . . .<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> · · · 2 ˆ<lb/> u<lb/> 2 N<lb/> 2<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Note that other less biased estimators are proposed in MacKinnon and White <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref>.<lb/> These adapted estimators are less used in practice and will not be considered in this<lb/> paper. This new data enables one to assess two biased but consistent estimators of the<lb/> covariance matrices of the OLS estimators,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ˆ<lb/> V W hite<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> =<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1<lb/> 1 N<lb/> ∑<lb/> n=1<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> u n 2 1 x n 1 x n<lb/> 1 X 1 X<lb/> −1<lb/> andˆVandˆ andˆV W hite<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> =<lb/> 2 X 2 X<lb/> −1<lb/> 2 N<lb/> ∑<lb/> n=1<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> u n 2 2 x n 2 x n<lb/> 2 X 2 X<lb/> −1<lb/></formula>

			<p>Moreover, under simple assumptions concerning the first moments of the regressors<lb/> (generally verified in practice), these estimators enables one to obtain the following<lb/> convergences in distribution,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ˆ<lb/> V W hite<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> andˆVandˆ andˆV W hite<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/></formula>

			<p>To conclude on the heteroskedastic framework, it is important to note that these<lb/> variance-covariance matrices estimators are biased and sometimes very volatile. The<lb/> heteroskedastic framework is more general and robust than the homoskedastic frame-<lb/>work. It is generally more adapted to our proxy methodologies.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3 Asymptotic confidence intervals<lb/></head>

			<p>In practice, the length of the asymptotic confidence intervals given the estimators of<lb/> the covariance matrices are good comparison tools provided by both homoskedastic<lb/> and heteroskedastic frameworks. This subsection describes the construction steps of<lb/> these intervals.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3.1 Asymptotic confidence intervals under the homoskedasticity assumption<lb/></head>

			<p>If H 2 is assumed, an asymptotic confidence interval for the approximate NAV can be<lb/> obtained, using the following convergences in law,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ˆ<lb/> V<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> andˆVandˆ andˆV<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> .<lb/></formula>

			<p>For the CF regression, the α% (with α% close to 1) asymptotic confidence interval<lb/> obtained from this formula, for ¯<lb/> x, a given regressors&apos; outcome, is,<lb/></p>

				<formula>1 IC<lb/> 1 N<lb/> α% ( ¯<lb/> xβ ) =<lb/> ¯<lb/> x 1 ˆ<lb/> β ±q 1+α%<lb/> 2<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> σ 2<lb/> ¯<lb/> x ( 1 X 1 X) −1 ¯<lb/> x<lb/> ,<lb/></formula>

			<p>and for the LSMC,<lb/></p> 

				<formula>2 IC<lb/> 2 N<lb/> α% ( ¯<lb/> xβ ) =<lb/> ¯<lb/> x 2 ˆ<lb/> β ±q 1+α%<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> σ 2<lb/> ¯<lb/> x ( 2 X 2 X) −1 ¯<lb/> x<lb/> ,<lb/> </formula>

			<p>denoting by q +α%<lb/> 2<lb/> the 1+α%<lb/> 2<lb/> quantile of a standard Gaussian distribution.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3.2 Asymptotic confidence intervals without the homoskedasticity assumption<lb/></head>

			<p>Without the homoskedasticity assumption it is also possible to build asymptotic con-<lb/>fidence intervals, based on Whites estimator <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref> properties. Indeed, this estimator<lb/> enables one to assess the following convergence in law,<lb/></p>

				<formula>ˆ<lb/> V W hite<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β | 1 X<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> andˆVandˆ andˆV W hite<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β | 2 X<lb/> − 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> β − β<lb/> d<lb/> N<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/> 0<lb/> . . .<lb/> 0<lb/> <lb/> <lb/>  , I K+1<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> <lb/></formula>

			<p>For the CF regression, the α% (with α% close to 1) asymptotic confidence interval<lb/> obtained from this formula, for ¯<lb/> x, a given regressors&apos; outcome, is,<lb/></p>

				<formula>1 IC<lb/> 1 N<lb/> α% ( ¯<lb/> xβ ) =<lb/> ¯<lb/> x 1 ˆ<lb/> β ±q 1+α%<lb/> 2<lb/> ¯<lb/> x ( 1 X 1 X) −1<lb/> ∑<lb/> 1 N<lb/> n=1<lb/> 1 ˆ<lb/> u n 2 1 x n 1 x n<lb/> ( 1 X 1 X) −1 ¯<lb/> x<lb/> ,<lb/> </formula>

			<p>and for the LSMC,<lb/></p> 

				<formula>2 IC<lb/> 2 N<lb/> α% ( ¯<lb/> xβ ) =<lb/> ¯<lb/> x 2 ˆ<lb/> β ±q 1+α%<lb/> 2<lb/> ¯<lb/> x ( 2 X 2 X) −1<lb/> ∑<lb/> 2 N<lb/> n=1<lb/> 2 ˆ<lb/> u n 2 2 x n 2 x n<lb/> ( 2 X 2 X) −1 ¯<lb/> x<lb/> .<lb/></formula>

			<p>Consider now a set of N independent outcomes following the same distribution as x,<lb/> ¯<lb/> x i<lb/> i∈1;N<lb/>. It is possible to calculate the lengths of the asymptotic confidence intervals<lb/> built for both CF and LSMC, and to compare these values to assess which estimator is<lb/> more efficient in practice (this will be used to see what happens when the number of<lb/> risk factors increases).<lb/></p> 

			<p>In the following subsection we will test empirically the results previously presented<lb/> when t = 0 + (continuous compliance framework).<lb/></p>

			<head>5.4.1 Implementation framework<lb/></head>

			<p>The implementation framework used in this section is the same as the one presented in<lb/> Section 4.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The LSMC approach has been run on a sample of 50 000 independent NPV 0 + out-<lb/>comes. To equalize the algorithmic complexity between both procedures, the CF ap-<lb/>proach has been launched on a sample of 100 independent<lb/> NAV 0 + outcomes, calculated<lb/> as means of 500 NPV 0 + (100 primary scenarios × 500 secondary scenarios).<lb/></p> 

			<p>To consider a more statistically efficient (due to the larger number of outcomes)<lb/> implementation framework we have chosen the LSMC methodology as a base to assess<lb/> the optimal set of regressors.<lb/></p>

			<p>For each given number of risk factors J(J = 1, ..., 4), these have been designated<lb/> using a stepwise backward approach based on the AIC stopping criteria and on an<lb/> initialization set of potential regressors<lb/> i ε k . j ε l , ∀i, j ∈ 1; J, ∀k, l ∈ N|k + l ≤ 3<lb/> , de-<lb/>noting by i ε k the i-th risk factor power k.<lb/></p>

			<p>The implementation steps are the same for each value of J,<lb/></p> 

			<item>• assessment of the LSMC optimal set of regressors J x and OLS estimator J ˆ<lb/> β LSMC ,<lb/></item> 

			<item>• use of the J x set of regressors to obtain the associated CF OLS estimator J ˆ<lb/> β CF ,<lb/></item> 

			<item>• implementation of a Breusch-Pagan homoskedasticity test on the LSMC method-<lb/>ology (there are too few outcomes to use a Breusch-Pagan test on the CF ap-<lb/>proach),<lb/></item> 

			<item>• comparison of the confidence interval lengths obtained on the 50 000 primary<lb/> scenarios sample used to implement the LSMC approach.<lb/></item>

			<head>5.4.2 Heteroskedasticity test<lb/></head>

			<p>In this study the heteroskedasticity has been tested using a Breusch-Pagan test. The<lb/> following results have been obtained on the various LSMC models on one, two, three<lb/> and four risk factors datas.<lb/></p>

			<p>The tests, and the homoskedastic assumption, are rejected even for a significance<lb/> level of 1%. Note that there are too few CF implementation data (100 outcomes per<lb/> number of risk factor) to assess robust homoskedasticity tests.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In the following subsections we will study the results obtained with both the LSMC<lb/> and CF methodologies (1/2/3/4 risk factors), for both the heteroskedastic and ho-<lb/>moskedastic formulas.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.4.3 Results in the homoskedastic framework<lb/></head>

			<p>Turning from an homoskedastic to an heteroskedastic framework enables to obtain<lb/> more robust results. Moreover, the heteroskedastic scheme seems more adapted for<lb/> our study. However, the homoskedastic formulas provide interesting results that can be<lb/> compared to those obtained using the heteroskedastic formulas in order to conclude on<lb/> this empirical subsection. The comparison of the homoskedastic parameters covariance<lb/> matrix estimators provides the following results.<lb/></p> 

			<p>One risk factor framework. Only two significant regressors have been selected after<lb/> implementing a backward stepwise methodology with an AIC stopping criteria.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.4.5 Conclusion on the empirical tests<lb/></head>

			<p>Two major comments can be made after having studied these results.<lb/></p> 

			<p>First, it is important to go further than just considering the results obtained under<lb/> the homoskedasticity assumption. If these results alone are observed the LSMC ap-<lb/>proach seems to be the best methodology in most cases. This is not the case when one<lb/> studies the results provided without the homoskedasticity assumption. Nota that the<lb/> heteroskedastic framework is more robust in general and is much more realistic here,<lb/> considering the Breusch-Pagan tests.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Second, we can assume that the heteroskedasticity shape has a great impact on the<lb/> efficiency comparison between both CF and LSMC methodology in a finite sample<lb/> framework. In particular, this directly modifies thê<lb/> V W hite estimator. One should note<lb/> that there are several econometrical methods to reduce the heteroskedasticity of our<lb/> model that have not been tested here. For more insight on these approaches see Greene<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In any case, our study does not evidence any superiodity of the LSMC over the<lb/> CF methodology. However, we have clearly seen, throughout the implementation,<lb/> that the small number of outcomes considered in the CF approach leads to statistical<lb/> issues while assessing homoskedasticity tests and confidence intervals. The problem<lb/> here seems to comes from the fact that there are too few outcomes to get through<lb/> the sample bias embedded within the secondary scenarios tables used to calculate the<lb/> NAV 0 + outcomes. In opposition, the sample bias that comes from the LSMC scenarios<lb/> is mitigated between the primary simulations. Eventually, the squared errors of the CF<lb/> implementation are lower than they would be if calculated on more outcomes, which<lb/> leads to artificially small confidence intervals. It is clear that this phenomenon takes<lb/> more and more importance as the number of risk factors / regressors rises.<lb/></p> 

			<p>To conclude we can only advise practitioners to prefer an LSMC methodology to<lb/> assess approximate NAV outcomes. The heteroskedasticity tests may always lead to a<lb/> rejection of the homoskedasticity assumption but the confidence intervals obtained will<lb/> always be more robust than those of a CF approach.<lb/></p>

			<p>Note that this implementation and its conclusions correspond to a specific (but real-<lb/>istic) empirical framework. The authors did not aim at drawing general conclusions on<lb/> the use of parametric proxies for life insurance NAV projections. This section, initially<lb/> only aiming at challenging the generally agreed idea that the LSMC methodology is<lb/> more robust than CF in a large dimension context, is eventually a good opportunity<lb/> to raise proxies implementation issues such as the heteroskedasticity management and<lb/> the asymptotic confidence intervals assessment.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The authors notice that Subsection 5.4 could have been completed with the compar-<lb/>ision the CF and LEMC results to real values of NAV . However, the real NAV outcomes<lb/> are unobservable in practice and good estimators imply a great number of secondary<lb/> scenarios. We wanted here to stay in a practical scheme, with great algorithmic con-<lb/>straints.<lb/></p>

			<head>6 Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>The continuous compliance requirement is a key strategic issue for European insur-<lb/>ers. In this article, we have presented the various characteristics of this problem and<lb/> provided a monitoring tool to answer it. Our monitoring scheme is based on the imple-<lb/>mentation of parametric proxies, already used among the insurance players to project<lb/> the Net Asset Value over time, adapted to fit the ORSA continuous compliance re-<lb/>quirements. The tool has been implemented on a realistic life insurance portfolio to<lb/> present the main features of both the development and the practical use of the monitor-<lb/>ing scheme. In particular several other relevant possible uses for the tool are presented.<lb/> In the last Section we have seen that the comparison of the Curve Fitting and the Least<lb/> Squares Monte Carlo methodologies in a finite sample framework and considering an<lb/> increasing dimensioning scheme, did not lead to firm conclusions but that the Least<lb/> Squares Monte Carlo led to fewer statistical issues especially to assess robust asymp-<lb/>totic confidence intervals. In addition, this section has been an opportunity to raise<lb/> several practical issues, such as the heteroskedasticity management and asymptotic<lb/> confidence intervals calculation, concerning the use of polynomial proxies (both Least<lb/> Squares Monte Carlo and Curve Fitting), in our framework (a life insurance savings<lb/> product).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Note that the monitoring tool only provides approximate values and is based on<lb/> assumptions that can be discussed. The authors notice that the modelling choices can<lb/> lead to errors. In particular we can only advice the future users of our tool to update<lb/> the proxies frequently in order to make sure that the underlying stability assumptions<lb/> are reasonable. One of the future axes to investigate is clearly to aim at a better control<lb/> of the error and to address in depth the issue of the proxies recalibration frequency.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In addition the possibility to add asset-mix weights in the monitored risk factors set<lb/> should be tested. This would greatly help asset managers to select optimal asset-mixes,<lb/> consistently with the risk strategy of the undertaking.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Eventually we intend to investigate the various possibilities provided by the econo-<lb/>metric theory to optimize the proxies calibration process in order to decrease the het-<lb/>eroskedasticity of our models and the volatility of the obtained estimators.</p>
