			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Accelerated expansion, modeled by a positive cosmological constant, is an essential<lb/> element of the current standard cosmological model of the Universe. The accelerated<lb/> expansion was originally motivated by supernova observations <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref> and is supported by<lb/> many other types of cosmological observations. Observational data are, in modern<lb/> cosmology, analyzed almost exclusively within the framework of homogeneous and<lb/> isotropic Friedmann models <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. This analysis leads to the concordance model, which<lb/> provides a remarkably precise fit to cosmological observations. In this situation, if the<lb/> Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> and &apos;almost EGS theorem&apos; <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> are invoked 5 , then it seems<lb/> that an assumption of large scale homogeneity of the Universe can be justified. This on<lb/> the other hand implies that the Universe must be filled with dark energy which currently<lb/> drives the acceleration of the Universe.<lb/></p> 

			<p>However, the concordance model is not the only one which can fit cosmological<lb/> observations. Anti-Copernican inhomogeneous models which assume the existence of a<lb/> local Gpc scale void also fit cosmological observations <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> (see <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref> for a review). Moreover,<lb/> on small and medium scales our Universe is not homogeneous. Therefore, one may<lb/> ask whether Friedmann models can describe our Universe correctly. In particular, it<lb/> is important to ask what is the best way to fit a homogeneous model to a realistic and<lb/> inhomogeneous Universe. This problem, known as the fitting problem, was considered<lb/> by Ellis and Stoeger <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. In considering the fitting problem, it becomes apparent that<lb/> a homogeneous model fitted to inhomogeneous data can evolve quite differently from<lb/> the real Universe. The difference between the evolutions of homogeneous models and<lb/> an inhomogeneous Universe is caused by back-reaction effects, due to the non-linearity<lb/> of the Einstein equation. Unfortunately, in the standard approach, the back-reaction is<lb/> rarely taken into account—in most cases when modeling our Universe on a local scale<lb/> Newtonian mechanics is employed and on large scales the Friedmann equations (or linear<lb/> perturbations of Friedmann background) are used <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>. Such an approach to cosmology<lb/> is often encouraged by the &apos;no-go&apos; theorem which states that the Universe can be very<lb/> accurately described by the conformal Newtonian metric perturbed about a spatially flat<lb/> background, even if δρ/ρ 0. In such a case the back-reaction is negligible <ref type="biblio">[10, 11]</ref>.<lb/> However, the results obtained by van Elst and Ellis <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref> and recently by Kolb, Marra<lb/> and Matarrese <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref> show that the application of &apos;no-go&apos; theorem is limited. Therefore,<lb/> one should be aware that in the absence of an analysis of the back-reaction and other<lb/> effects caused by inhomogeneities in the Universe, there remains the possibility that the<lb/> observed accelerated expansion of the Universe is only apparent <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. The direct study<lb/> of the dynamical effects of inhomogeneities is difficult. Due to the non-linearity of the<lb/> Einstein equations, the solution of the Einstein equations for the homogeneous matter<lb/> distribution leads in principle to a different description of the Universe than an average of<lb/> an inhomogeneous solution to the exact Einstein equations (even though inhomogeneities<lb/> when averaged over a sufficiently large scale might tend to be zero).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Neither the analysis of the evolution of a general matter distribution nor the numerical<lb/> evolution of cosmological models employing the full Einstein equations are available at<lb/> the level of detail which would make them useful for this problem. There are currently<lb/> several different approaches which attempt to take back-reaction effects into account. One<lb/> approach is based on exact solutions—see for example <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. Another and more popular<lb/> approach is based on averaging.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In the averaging approach to back-reaction, one considers a solution to the Einstein<lb/> equations for a general matter distribution and then an average of various observable<lb/> quantities is taken. If a simple volume average is considered then such an attempt<lb/> leads to the Buchert equations <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. The Buchert equations are very similar to the<lb/> Friedmann equations except for the back-reaction term which is in general non-vanishing,<lb/> if inhomogeneities are present. For a review on back-reaction and the Buchert averaging<lb/> scheme the reader is referred to <ref type="biblio">[17, 18]</ref>. Within this framework and using spherically<lb/> symmetric inhomogeneous models Nambu and Tanimoto <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>, Paranjape and Singh <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>,<lb/> Kai et al <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>, Chuang et al <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>, provided explicit examples that one can obtain negative<lb/> values of the volume deceleration parameter even if Λ = 0. Another interesting example<lb/> was presented by Räsänen <ref type="biblio">[17, 23]</ref> where it was shown that the total volume deceleration<lb/> parameter of two isolated and locally decelerating regions can also be negative.<lb/></p> 

			<p>There are however important ambiguities in the application of an averaging procedure.<lb/> The average itself not only depends on a choice of volume but also on a choice of time<lb/> slicing. This is very crucial in cosmology. Once inhomogeneities are present the age of<lb/> the Universe is not everywhere the same. Namely, the big bang in inhomogeneous models<lb/> is not a single event, so the average taken over a hypersurface of constant cosmic time<lb/> t is different from the average taken over a hypersurface of constant age of the Universe<lb/> t−t B <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref>. Moreover, the results of the averaging procedure vary if the discrepancy between<lb/> the average cosmic time and the local time is introduced (the local time is the time which<lb/> is measured by local clocks; the cosmic time is the time which appears in the averaged<lb/> homogeneous model). This phenomenon was studied by Wiltshire <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>, and has been<lb/> used in an ambitious alternative concordance model. The model proposed by Wiltshire<lb/> introduces some additional assumptions which allow to some extent a comparison of<lb/> averaged quantities with observations. Such a comparison shows quite good agreement<lb/> with observations <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>. Thus, while serious fundamental questions remain concerning<lb/> Wiltshire&apos;s approach, it is another example of an approach where one does not need dark<lb/> energy to fit cosmological observations.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The averaging procedure is also gauge dependent. For example using different gauge<lb/> one can obtain that the back-reaction mimics not dark energy but dark matter <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. The<lb/> averaging schemes in the literature, therefore, have been criticized, and their inherent<lb/> ambiguities (and in some cases obscurity) have been discussed; cf e.g. <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. A key point<lb/> is that it is far from obvious whether the average quantities, such as the acceleration<lb/> of the averaged Universe, are really the quantities which are measured in astronomical<lb/> observations. In particular, an operational analysis is to a large extent lacking in the<lb/> discussions of averaging. Thus, it is important to test the averaging procedures with the<lb/> exact and inhomogeneous solutions of the Einstein equations. Within exact models each<lb/> quantity can easily be calculated and then compared with its averaged counterpart. This<lb/> paper aims to perform such an analysis within the LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman model.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The structure of this paper is as follows. Buchert&apos;s averaging procedure is presented<lb/> in section 2, and some background on the LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman model is given in section 3.<lb/> The volume and distance deceleration parameters are introduced in section 4. Finally,<lb/> in section 5, we discuss the relation between the deceleration parameters, supernova<lb/> observations and models of cosmic structures.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. The Buchert scheme<lb/></head>

			<p>If the averaging procedure is applied to the Einstein equations, then for irrotational and<lb/> pressureless matter the following equations are obtained <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>:<lb/></p>

				<formula>3<lb/> ¨<lb/> a<lb/> a<lb/> = −4πGρ + Q,<lb/> <label>(1)</label><lb/></formula> 

				<formula>3<lb/> ˙<lb/> a 2<lb/> a 2 = 8πGρ −<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> R −<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> Q,<lb/> <label>(2)</label><lb/></formula> 

				<formula>Q ≡ 2<lb/> 3<lb/> Θ 2 − Θ 2 − 2σ 2 ,<lb/> <label>(3)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>where R is an average of the spatial Ricci scalar (3) R, Θ is the scalar of expansion, σ<lb/> is the shear scalar, and is the volume average over the hypersurface of constant time:<lb/></p>

				<formula>A = (<lb/> d 3 x<lb/> √ −h) −1<lb/> d 3 x<lb/>√ −hA. </formula>

			<p>The scale factor a is defined as follows:<lb/></p>

				<formula>a = (V /V 0 ) 1/3 ,<lb/> <label>(4)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>where V 0 is an initial volume.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Equations <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> are very similar to the Friedmann equations, where Q = 0, and<lb/> ρ and R depend on time only. In fact, they are kinematically equivalent to a Friedmann<lb/> model that has an additional scalar field source <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>. However the Buchert equation does<lb/> not form a closed system. To close these equations one has to introduce some further<lb/> assumptions <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. As can be seen from <ref type="formula">(3)</ref>, if the dispersion of expansion is large, Q can<lb/> be large as well and one can get acceleration (¨ a &gt; 0) without employing the cosmological<lb/> constant.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. The LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman model<lb/></head>

			<p>The LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman model 6 <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref> is a spherically symmetric, pressure free and<lb/> irrotational solution of the Einstein equations. Its metric is of the following form:<lb/></p>

				<formula>ds 2 = c 2 dt 2 −<lb/> R 2 (r, t)<lb/> 1 + 2E(r)<lb/> dr 2 − R 2 (t, r) dΩ 2 ,<lb/> <label>(5)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>where dΩ 2 = dθ 2 + sin 2 θ dφ 2 . Because of the signature (+, −, −, −), the E(r) function<lb/> must obey E(r) ≥ −1/2. The prime denotes ∂ r .<lb/></p> 

			<p>The Einstein equations reduce, in the Λ = 0 case, to the following two:<lb/></p>

				<formula>κρ(r, t)c 2 =<lb/> 2M (r)<lb/> R 2 (r, t)R (r, t)<lb/> ,<lb/> <label>(6)</label><lb/></formula> 

				<formula>1<lb/> c 2<lb/> ˙<lb/> R 2 (r, t) = 2E(r) +<lb/> 2M(r)<lb/> R(r, t)<lb/> ,<lb/> <label>(7)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>where M(r) is another arbitrary function and κ = 8πG/c 4 . The dot ˙ denotes ∂ t .<lb/></p> 

			<p>When R = 0 and M = 0, the density becomes infinite. This happens at shell<lb/> crossings. This is a singularity additional to the big bang that occurs at R = 0, M = 0.<lb/> By setting the initial conditions appropriately the shell crossing singularity can be avoided<lb/> (see <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref> for detailed discussion).<lb/> Equation <ref type="formula">(7)</ref> can be solved by simple integration:<lb/> R<lb/></p>

				<formula>0<lb/> d ˜<lb/> R<lb/> 2E + (2M/ ˜<lb/> R)<lb/> = c [t − t B (r)] ,<lb/> <label>(8)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>where t B appears as an integration constant and is an arbitrary function of r. This means<lb/> that the big bang is not a single event as in the Friedmann models, but occurs at different<lb/> times at different distances from the origin.<lb/> The scalar of the expansion is equal to<lb/></p>

				<formula>Θ =<lb/> ˙<lb/> R<lb/> R + 2<lb/> ˙<lb/> R<lb/> R<lb/> .<lb/> <label>(9)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>The shear tensor is of the following form:<lb/></p>

				<formula>σ α β =<lb/> 1<lb/> 3<lb/> ˙<lb/> R<lb/> R −<lb/> ˙<lb/> R<lb/> R<lb/> diag(0, 2, −1, −1),<lb/> <label>(10)</label><lb/></formula> 

			<p>and thus</p> 

				<formula>σ 2 ≡ (1/2)σ αβ σ αβ = (1/3)( ˙<lb/> R /R − ˙<lb/> R/R) 2 .<lb/></formula>

			<p>The spatial Ricci scalar in the LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman is equal to<lb/></p>

				<formula>(3)<lb/> R = −<lb/> 4<lb/> R 2<lb/> E +<lb/> E R<lb/> R<lb/> .<lb/> <label>(11)</label><lb/></formula>

			<head>4. The apparent and average accelerations<lb/></head>

			<p>The deceleration parameter within the Friedmann models is defined as<lb/></p>

				<formula>q = −<lb/> ¨<lb/> aa<lb/> ˙<lb/> a 2 ,<lb/> <label>(12)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>where a is the scale factor. By analogy we can define the deceleration parameter which is<lb/> based on the averaging scheme. Substituting (4) into (12) and using <ref type="formula">(1)</ref> and <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> we get<lb/></p>

				<formula>q vol = −<lb/> −4πGρ + Q<lb/> 8πGρ − 1/2R − 1/2Q<lb/> .<lb/> <label>(13)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>We refer to this deceleration parameter as the volume deceleration parameter, q vol , since it<lb/> is positive when the second derivative of volume is negative and negative when the second<lb/> derivative of volume is positive (and of sufficiently large value).<lb/></p> 

			<p>On the other hand one can introduce a deceleration parameter defined relative to<lb/> the distance. Within homogeneous models the distance to a given redshift is larger for<lb/> accelerating models than for decelerating ones. Taylor expanding the luminosity distance<lb/> in the Friedmann model we obtain<lb/></p>

				<formula>D L =<lb/> dD L<lb/> dz<lb/> z=0<lb/> z +<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> d 2 D L<lb/> dz 2<lb/> z=0<lb/> z 2 + O(z 3 )<lb/> =<lb/> c<lb/> H 0<lb/> z +<lb/> c<lb/> 2H 0<lb/> (1 − q)z 2 + O(z 3 ).<lb/> <label>(14)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>Employing a similar procedure in the case of the LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman model we get<lb/></p>

				<formula>D L =<lb/> cR<lb/> ˙<lb/> R<lb/> z +<lb/> c<lb/> 2<lb/> R<lb/> ˙<lb/> R<lb/> 1 +<lb/> R ¨<lb/> R<lb/> ˙<lb/> R 2<lb/> +<lb/> cR<lb/> R ˙<lb/> R<lb/> −<lb/> c ˙<lb/> R<lb/> ˙<lb/> R 2<lb/> z 2 + O(z 3 ).<lb/> <label>(15)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>Thus by comparing <ref type="formula">(15)</ref> with <ref type="formula">(14)</ref>, the Hubble and the deceleration parameters in the<lb/> LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman model can be defined as<lb/></p>

				<formula>H dis<lb/> 0 =<lb/> ˙<lb/> R<lb/> R ,<lb/> q dis<lb/> 0 = −<lb/> R ¨<lb/> R<lb/> ˙<lb/> R 2<lb/> −<lb/> cR<lb/> R ˙<lb/> R<lb/> +<lb/> c ˙<lb/> R<lb/> ˙<lb/> R 2<lb/> .<lb/> <label>(16)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>The above quantities are defined at the origin (r = 0). However, following Partovi and<lb/> Mashhoon <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref> we can extend the above quantities to any r. Then, the coefficients of<lb/> Taylor expansion are<lb/></p>

				<formula>dD L<lb/> dz<lb/> = 2R + ˙<lb/> R<lb/> dt<lb/> dz<lb/> + R dr<lb/> dz<lb/> d 2 D L<lb/> dz 2 = 2R + 4 ˙<lb/> R<lb/> dt<lb/> dz<lb/> + 4R dr<lb/> dz<lb/> + ¨<lb/> R<lb/> dt<lb/> dz<lb/> 2<lb/> + 2 ˙<lb/> R dt<lb/> dz<lb/> dr<lb/> dz<lb/> + R<lb/> dr<lb/> dz<lb/> 2<lb/> + ˙<lb/> R<lb/> d 2 t<lb/> dz 2 + R d 2 r<lb/> dz 2 ,<lb/> <label>(17)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>and we obtain<lb/></p>

				<formula>H dis =<lb/> dD L<lb/> dz<lb/> −1<lb/> ,<lb/> q dis = 1 − H dis d 2 D L<lb/> dz 2 .<lb/> <label>(18)</label><lb/></formula>

			<p>We refer to this deceleration parameter as the distance deceleration parameter. Although<lb/> of physical importance is the luminosity distance and its ability of fitting the supernova<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. The residual Hubble diagram for models 1–4. The black dashed line<lb/> presents Δm for the ΛCDM model.<lb/></figure>

			<p>data, q dis is of great usefulness. It allows us, without solving the geodesic equations, to<lb/> easily check whether a model being considered can be used to fit supernova data. As we<lb/> will see in the next section, models which fit supernova data have at least in some regions<lb/> q dis &lt; 0.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Connection between the deceleration parameter and observations<lb/></head>

			<p>Let us first focus on supernova observations. There is already a considerable literature<lb/> on inhomogeneous models which are able to fit the supernova observations without the<lb/> cosmological constant <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. We shall examine four such models in this section. For each<lb/> of these models we shall calculate the volume and distance deceleration parameters and<lb/> compare them with each other. The four models to be considered present a very good fit<lb/> to supernova data. The supernova data consists of 182 supernovae from the Riess gold<lb/> sample <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. The χ 2 test values for models 1–4 are respectively 183.6, 184.3, 164.7, and<lb/> 178.5 (for comparison the χ 2 of fitting the ΛCDM model is 165.3). The residual Hubble<lb/> diagram for these models is presented in <ref type="figure">figure 1</ref>. The deceleration parameters for models<lb/> 1–4 are presented in <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>. The left panel presents the distance deceleration parameter<lb/> (as defined by <ref type="formula">(18)</ref>—where dt/dz and dr/dz were calculated for the radial geodesic).<lb/> The distance deceleration parameter is positive at the origin, but soon becomes negative.<lb/> Moreover, a very similar shape is obtained if instead of q dis (as defined by <ref type="formula">(18)</ref>), q dis<lb/> 0<lb/> (as defined by <ref type="formula">(16)</ref>) is used. Thus, q dis (or even q dis<lb/> 0 , if treated as a function of r) can<lb/> be regarded as a useful test for checking whether a given model is able to fit supernova<lb/> data. However, the most significant feature is that the volume deceleration parameter,<lb/> which is presented in the right panel of <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>, is strictly positive. Thus, the ability of<lb/> reproducing the supernova data does not require that the volume deceleration parameter<lb/> is negative. This raises the question of whether the average acceleration has any relation to<lb/> the observed acceleration of the Universe; and if yes, are models with average acceleration<lb/> also able to fit supernova data?<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. The distance deceleration parameter (left panel) and the volume<lb/> deceleration parameter (right panel) for models 1–4.<lb/></figure> 

			<figure>Figure 3. The current density distribution (left panel) and deceleration parameter<lb/> (right panel) for model 5.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Let us now focus on models of cosmic structures. It was recently shown that using<lb/> a perturbative approach, back-reaction cannot explain the apparent acceleration <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>.<lb/> However, because of the large density fluctuations within cosmic structures, results<lb/> obtained in terms of the perturbation framework might be questionable. Moreover,<lb/> in view of the fact that there are known examples of exact inhomogeneous models<lb/> with negative volume deceleration parameter and Λ = 0, it is worthwhile to check<lb/> whether realistically evolving models of cosmic structures can have negative values of the<lb/> deceleration parameter. First, let us consider a model of galaxy clusters with the Navarro–<lb/> Frenk–White density distribution <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref> (left panel of <ref type="figure">figure 3</ref>). Although the NFW profile<lb/> describes virialized systems 7 , the use of this profile will prove to be very instructive. The<lb/> average deceleration parameter q vol for model 5 is presented in the right panel of <ref type="figure">figure 3</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<figure>Figure 4. The current density distribution (left panel) and volume deceleration<lb/> parameter (right panel) for models of cosmic structures (models 6, 7).<lb/></figure> 

			<p>As can be seen, in this case the deceleration parameter is positive (curve 5a). However, it<lb/> is possible to modify this model so that q vol becomes negative—curve 5b in the right panel<lb/> of <ref type="figure">figure 3</ref>. This was obtained by choosing the E function which is of large positive value<lb/> (for details see the appendix). However, after such a modification this model becomes<lb/> unrealistic. Specifically, the age of the Universe in this model becomes unrealistically<lb/> small. The bang time function t B in this model is of large amplitude, around 11.44 × 10 9<lb/> y. This means that the actual age of the Universe in this model is approximately a few<lb/> hundred thousand years.<lb/> Now let us examine the volume deceleration parameter within models of cosmic voids<lb/> and superclusters. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> presents density distribution of realistically evolving cosmic<lb/> structures (void—curve 6, supercluster—curve 7). It can be seen from the right panel<lb/> of <ref type="figure">figure 4</ref> that the volume deceleration parameter within these models is positive. As<lb/> above, we can modify our models in such a way that the volume deceleration parameter<lb/> is negative, but again this leads to a very large amplitude of t B . For example, in model<lb/> 8, whose density and the volume deceleration parameter are presented in <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>, the 8<lb/> volume deceleration parameter is negative. However, the bang time function in model 8<lb/> is of amplitude ≈11 × 10 9 y, which leads to an unrealistically small age of the Universe.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>In this paper we have studied the relation between the volume deceleration parameter<lb/> obtained within the Buchert averaging scheme and the deceleration parameter derived<lb/> from the observations of supernovae. This work was motivated by recent results showing<lb/> that there are models for which, despite Λ being zero, the average expansion rate is<lb/> accelerating, i.e. ¨<lb/> a &gt; 0 (where a is defined by relation <ref type="formula">(4)</ref>). This opens the possibility that<lb/> back-reaction and averaging effects may be used as an interesting alternative explanation<lb/> to the dark energy phenomenon.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5. The current density distribution (left panel) and deceleration parameter<lb/> (right panel) for model 8.<lb/></figure>

			<p>We have compared the quantities obtained within the exact and inhomogeneous<lb/> models with their average counterparts. We focused on the supernova observations and<lb/> models of cosmic structures. For this purpose the LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman model was employed.<lb/> It was shown numerically that the averaging of models which fit the supernova observations<lb/> does not lead to volume acceleration (¨ a &lt; 0 for these averaged models and hence q vol &gt; 0).<lb/> It was also shown that realistically evolving models of cosmic structures have also q vol &gt; 0.<lb/> It was possible to modify these models in such a way that after the averaging, q vol &lt; 0.<lb/> This was obtained by choosing the E function of positive amplitude—as was recently<lb/> proved by Sussman <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref> this is a necessary condition for obtaining q vol &lt; 0. However, in<lb/> models with realistic density distributions, in such case, E 1 M/R ≈ 10 −7 –10 −6 ;<lb/> hence, as seen from <ref type="formula">(8)</ref>, t B ≈ t (recall that c × 10 10 y ≈ 3 Gpc). Thus, within such models,<lb/> the age of the Universe is unrealistically small.<lb/> Our analysis has been performed for the limited class of LemaˆıtreLemaˆıtre–Tolman models,<lb/> which due to their spherical symmetry are arguably too simple to give a full understanding<lb/> of averaging and back-reaction problems. However, we conclude that, within this class,<lb/> the volume deceleration parameter q vol is not a quantity which can be directly related to<lb/> observations.<lb/> It is possible that the volume deceleration parameter q vol becomes negative only after<lb/> averaging over scales which are larger than 100 Mpc. On such large scales the structure<lb/> of the Universe becomes too complicated to be fully described by spherically symmetric<lb/> models. However, it is intriguing that models which fit the supernova observations and<lb/> for which the distance deceleration parameter, q dis , is negative still have q vol &gt; 0. This<lb/> suggests that the volume deceleration q vol does not have a clear interpretation in terms of<lb/> observable quantities. It does not, of course, mean that averaging and back-reaction effects<lb/> cannot potentially be employed to explain the phenomenon of dark energy. However, our<lb/> work here indicates that such a potential solution of the dark energy problem should<lb/> be based upon methods different to those related to the volume deceleration parameter.<lb/> Rather than showing that q vol &lt; 0, the averaging approach should explain observations—<lb/> reproduce correct values of distances to supernovae, the correct shape of the CMB power<lb/> spectrum, etc. An interesting, quasi-Friedmannian approach was recently suggested<lb/> in <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>. In this approach, back-reaction is modeled in terms of the morphon field <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>.<lb/> In such a case a Universe is described by a homogeneous model with the spatial curvature<lb/> being just a function of time. As shown in <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>, such an approach leads to agreement with<lb/> supernova and CMB data without the need for dark energy, but requires q vol &lt; 0.<lb/></p>
