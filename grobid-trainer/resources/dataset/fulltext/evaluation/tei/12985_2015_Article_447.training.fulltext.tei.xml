			<head>Background<lb/></head>

			<p>Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, chronic<lb/> hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains an important<lb/> cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, in<lb/> particular in East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. In<lb/> clinical diagnostics, HBV DNA levels in serum are the<lb/> most important marker for the assessment of prognosis<lb/> and treatment outcome during chronic HBV infection.<lb/> In early stage of chronic infection HBV DNA usually<lb/> persists at high levels, above 7–8 log 10 IU/mL, for many<lb/> years, often decades. Later in life the HBV DNA levels<lb/> decline when the immune response evolves to more effi-<lb/>ciently suppress viral replication. The greatest reduction<lb/> of HBV DNA is observed at loss of hepatitis B e antigen<lb/> (HBeAg) from the blood, a critical step that typically<lb/> represents a transition from high to low replicative stage,<lb/> usually also conferring clinical improvement <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. Mecha-<lb/>nisms that explain this pronounced reduction of viremia<lb/> are not fully clarified. Part of the reduction of HBV<lb/> DNA in serum is a result of reduced intrahepatic levels<lb/> of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), and of<lb/> the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), a transcript from cccDNA<lb/> that is reverse transcribed to minus strand HBV DNA<lb/> during formation of new viral particles <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. The cccDNA<lb/> minichromosome is also template for transcripts that are<lb/> translated into hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg) em-<lb/>bedded in the envelope of both virions and so-called sub-<lb/>viral particles (SVP), of which the latter are produced in<lb/> great excess <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In diagnostics, detection of HBsAg has been used as<lb/> the basic test for identification of HBV infection for de-<lb/>cades. Recently, quantification of HBsAg has come into<lb/> focus as a complement to HBV DNA levels for monitor-<lb/>ing both the natural course of infection and the response<lb/> to treatment <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. Levels of HBsAg, which mainly repre-<lb/>sent the levels of SVP <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>, are more stable over time than<lb/> HBV DNA, with a much smaller decline during the<lb/> course of infection. This difference is in particular strik-<lb/>ing during loss of HBeAg when HBV DNA declines by<lb/> 3–4 log 10 or even more, whereas the HBsAg levels often<lb/> are reduced by only 1 log 10 <ref type="biblio">[6–8]</ref>. As a consequence, the<lb/> ratio between these two serum markers (HBV DNA/<lb/> HBsAg) decreases when HBV DNA reaches very low or<lb/> even undetectable levels while HBsAg remains at signifi-<lb/>cant levels <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>. Previous studies indeed indicate that re-<lb/>duced transcription of pgRNA from cccDNA may<lb/> contribute to the decline in HBV DNA <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. It is how-<lb/>ever not well known to what extent such effects are spe-<lb/>cific for pgRNA, i.e. are not also reducing S-RNA. In the<lb/> present study we explored the relations between HBV<lb/> markers in serum and liver biopsies from both HBeAg-<lb/>positive and HBeAg-negative patients, searching for ex-<lb/>planations to the strong reduction of HBV DNA in<lb/> serum and the shift in HBV DNA/HBsAg ratio that<lb/> occur in parallel with loss of HBeAg. The contribution<lb/> of different steps of replication to the reduced serum<lb/> levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg is discussed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head> 

			<head>Patient characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>A summary of patient characteristics is found in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.<lb/> HBeAg-negative patients had significantly lower levels of<lb/> viral markers than HBeAg-positive patients except for a<lb/> higher ratio of S-RNA to cccDNA.<lb/></p>

			<head>Reduction of viral replication prior to loss of HBeAg<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to study this, the levels of HBV markers within<lb/> HBeAg-positive patients, and correlations between them,<lb/> were analysed. As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref>, the levels of<lb/> cccDNA spanned over more than 2 log 10 units within<lb/> this group. Levels of pgRNA correlated well with<lb/> cccDNA (R 2 = 0.88), with a regression line slope of 1.33,<lb/> indicating that a 2 log 10 decline of cccDNA<lb/> corresponded to a 2.7 log 10 decline of pgRNA. The cor-<lb/>relations in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b</ref> (ihDNA and pgRNA) and C (serum<lb/> HBV DNA and ihDNA) were also strong among<lb/> HBeAg-positive patients, with R 2 = 0.88 and R 2 = 0.77.<lb/> The slopes were however different, indicating that<lb/> ihDNA declines less than pgRNA (k = 0.56), whereas<lb/> HBV DNA in serum declines more than ihDNA (k =<lb/> 1.96). As a result, the correlation between pgRNA and<lb/> HBV DNA in serum had k = 1.04 (R 2 = 0.62), indicating<lb/> that until loss of HBeAg, reduction of HBV DNA in<lb/> serum is achieved mainly by mechanisms that lead to re-<lb/>duced pgRNA levels (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1d</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Viral markers after loss of HBeAg<lb/></head>

			<p>To some extent this can be studied by analysing correlations<lb/> between viral markers within HBeAg-negative patients.<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 2a</ref> shows that the correlation between cccDNA<lb/> and pgRNA was poorer (R 2 = 0.36) than in HBeAg-<lb/>positive stage, indicating that the regulation of pgRNA<lb/> levels becomes more variable after loss of HBeAg. By<lb/> contrast, the correlation between pgRNA and ihDNA<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref>) remained strong and with a similar slope in<lb/> HBeAg-negative (R 2 = 0.72, k = 0.50) as in HBeAg-positive<lb/> patients, suggesting that the rate of reverse transcription<lb/> is unaltered after loss of HBeAg. The correlation between<lb/> ihDNA and serum HBV DNA was on the other hand re-<lb/>markably different in HBeAg-negative patients (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2c</ref>)<lb/> with low R 2 (0.14). In particular, the levels of HBV DNA<lb/> in serum were much lower in a large proportion of pa-<lb/>tients than one would expect from the pgRNA and<lb/> ihDNA level (if the correlations had been the same as<lb/> in HBeAg-positive stage), suggesting that viremia is<lb/></p>

			<p>Comparisons of viral markers at group level (HBeAg-<lb/>positive vs. negative) revealed differences due to combined<lb/> effects before and after loss of HBeAg, and are shown by<lb/> box plots in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a</ref>.

These differences influence the ratios<lb/> </p>

			<p>between these parameters as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref>. Thus,<lb/> the HBV DNA/pgRNA and HBV DNA/ihDNA ratios<lb/> were much lower, whereas the HBsAg/S-RNA ratio was<lb/> the same, in HBeAg-negative as compared with HBeAg-<lb/>positive patients.<lb/></p>

			<head>Difference in reduction of viral and subviral particles<lb/></head>

			<p>This was studied by comparing HBV DNA and HBsAg<lb/> levels in serum (i.e. the ratio between them), and by<lb/> comparing the corresponding transcripts (pgRNA and<lb/> S-RNA). As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3a</ref>, the levels of HBsAg and<lb/></p>

The diverging de-<lb/>gree of reduction of viral and subviral particles is fur-<lb/>ther illustrated by <ref type="figure">Fig. 3c</ref>, which shows how ratios<lb/> between levels of viral and subviral markers change after<lb/> loss of HBeAg. Thus, there was a marked reduction of<lb/> the HBV DNA/HBsAg ratio, and this was to some ex-<lb/>tent observed also for the corresponding transcripts,<lb/> pgRNA/S-RNA. However, whereas the ratio pgRNA/<lb/> cccDNA was lower after loss of HBeAg, the ratio S-<lb/>RNA/cccDNA was instead increased. Thus, the pgRNA/<lb/> cccDNA ratio was significantly lower than S-RNA/cccDNA<lb/> in HBeAg-negative patients (P &lt; 0.0001), but similar in<lb/> HBeAg-positive patients.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>This study of intrahepatic HBV RNA and HBV DNA<lb/> and their correlation with each other and with levels<lb/> of HBV DNA and HBsAg in serum may help to<lb/> understand how HBV replication is suppressed during<lb/> the course of infection and how low serum levels of<lb/> HBV DNA and HBsAg are achieved. Part of our re-<lb/>sults agree well with published studies <ref type="biblio">[11–13]</ref>, but<lb/> the observations of an increased S-RNA/pgRNA ratio<lb/> after loss of HBeAg, and of the much greater decline<lb/> of serum HBV DNA than of intrahepatic HBV DNA<lb/> have to our knowledge not been described before.<lb/></p>

			<p>Within HBeAg-positive patients, lower serum levels of<lb/> HBV DNA essentially reflected lower levels of the<lb/> cccDNA template in combination with reduced amounts<lb/> of pgRNA per cccDNA. Our results, with a 2 log 10 lower<lb/> cccDNA level in HBeAg-negative patients are identical<lb/> with the observations by Werle-Lapostelle et al. <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>,<lb/> whereas other studies have reported smaller reduction<lb/> (≈1 log 10 ) after loss of HBeAg <ref type="biblio">[12, 13]</ref>. The reduced<lb/> levels of cccDNA after loss of HBeAg is probably mainly<lb/> a result of eradication of infected hepatocytes by cyto-<lb/>toxic T cells <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref> in combination with lower cccDNA<lb/> content in each infected cell.<lb/></p>

			<p>Concern has been raised regarding the specificity of<lb/> cccDNA PCR assay, i.e. whether this assay amplifies only<lb/> cccDNA. When this method was introduced by Köck<lb/> and Schlicht they showed that the degree of cross-<lb/>reactivity, i.e. amplification by cccDNA primers of other<lb/> forms of HBV DNA, was low, corresponding to a 3 log 10<lb/> lower sensitivity <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. We found the same degree of<lb/> cross-reactivity when we repeated their experiments<lb/> using real-time PCR (results not shown). When analys-<lb/>ing liver biopsies, we found that cccDNA levels were on<lb/> average 1.90 log 10 lower than ihDNA, and not 3 log 10<lb/> lower as one would expect if the cccDNA findings were<lb/> due to cross-reactivity. This indicates that a low<lb/> specificity of the assay should have limited impact on<lb/> our cccDNA results.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to lower cccDNA levels, we found in HBeAg-<lb/>negative patients a lower pgRNA/cccDNA ratio. This<lb/> mechanism of reduced virus production has been pro-<lb/>posed by others, and might be mediated by different<lb/> mechanisms such as accelerated intracellular clearance<lb/> of pgRNA-containing capsids induced by IFN-alfa/-beta<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>, or by IFN-alfa mediated suppression of HBV repli-<lb/>cation by epigenetic control of cccDNA function and<lb/> transcription <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>. Among our patients, the reduction<lb/> of the pgRNA/cccDNA ratio was quite moderate (0.57<lb/> log 10 ), whereas Volz et al. and Laras et al. found larger<lb/> reductions (0.88 and 1.46 log 10 ) <ref type="biblio">[12, 13]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Within HBeAg-positive stage, pgRNA and serum HBV<lb/> DNA correlated strongly with a slope of ≈ 1, meaning<lb/> that 1 log 10 decline of pgRNA results in 1 log 10 decline<lb/> of HBV DNA in serum. In HBeAg-negative patients,<lb/> the relations between cccDNA, replicative intermediates<lb/> (pgRNA and ihDNA) and levels of HBV DNA in serum<lb/> were more complex.<lb/></p>

			<p>Firstly, levels of pgRNA showed poorer correlation with<lb/> cccDNA, suggesting that suppression acting on this step<lb/> varies considerably between patients.<lb/></p>

			<p>Secondly, in patients with lower cccDNA there were<lb/> relatively higher levels of ihDNA, as indicated by both<lb/> the slope of the ihDNA/pgRNA regression line and the<lb/> higher ihDNA/pgRNA ratio in HBeAg-negative patients.<lb/> The explanation to this relative increase of ihDNA among<lb/> HBeAg-negative patients is uncertain. It might be due to<lb/> production of non-productive replicative intermediates, or<lb/> retention of viral particles that are not secreted into the<lb/> blood. The latter possibility would agree with a study de-<lb/>scribing that viral particles can be blocked by anti-HBs<lb/> antibodies internalized in liver cells <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. Another study<lb/> did however not report differences in virion release be-<lb/>tween HBeAg-positive and negative patients <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>, and our<lb/> finding and possible explanations need to be further ex-<lb/>plored. One also has to consider the possibility that inte-<lb/>grated HBV DNA contributes to ihDNA, because such<lb/> integrations would be detected by our real-time PCR as-<lb/>says (if they include the target region). In early stage their<lb/> contribution would probably be minimal, but when the<lb/> production of relaxed circular DNA in virions declines in<lb/> HBeAg-negative patients the amount of integrated HBV<lb/> DNA might be high enough to influence the measured<lb/> ihDNA level.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thirdly, in several HBeAg-negative patients the HBV<lb/> DNA level in serum was reduced much more than what<lb/> would be expected by the reduction of ihDNA, suggesting<lb/> that factors acting downstream of reverse transcription<lb/> may have great impact on HBV DNA in serum. Such fac-<lb/>tors might, as mentioned above, be reduced release of vi-<lb/>rions from infected cells, or shorter half-life of viral<lb/> particles in serum. The possibility that enhanced clearance<lb/> of free virions from the blood contributes to the pro-<lb/>nounced reduction of HBV DNA levels in serum after loss<lb/> of HBeAg has not been much studied or discussed. Math-<lb/>ematical calculations based on HBV kinetics under anti-<lb/>viral therapy <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref> suggested that the half-life of free<lb/> virions is ~25 h in HBeAg-positive and ~13 h in<lb/> HBeAg-negative patients <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. Another study reported<lb/> similar half-lives in HBeAg-positive patients (17 h), but<lb/> extremely short half-life in HBeAg-negative patients<lb/> (0.6 s) <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>, data that subsequently were questioned <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>.<lb/> Despite the discrepancies it seems likely that stronger im-<lb/>munologic responses may lead to faster clearance of vi-<lb/>rions, but how much this influences serum levels of HBV<lb/> DNA remains to be elucidated.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whereas HBV DNA levels were more than 4.0 log 10<lb/> lower in HBeAg-negative patients, levels of HBsAg were<lb/> on average only 1.1 log 10 lower. Accordingly, the HBV<lb/> DNA/HBsAg ratio was 3.3 log 10 lower in HBeAg-negative<lb/> patients, as observed also in previous studies <ref type="biblio">[13, 23, 24]</ref>.<lb/> To some extent this was explained by a reduced ratio (by<lb/> 2.0 log 10 ) between the corresponding transcripts (pgRNA/<lb/> S-RNA) in HBeAg-negative patients. This reduction of<lb/> pgRNA/S-RNA is greater than the 1.2 log 10 difference re-<lb/>ported by Volz et al. <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>, and was explained by both re-<lb/>duced pgRNA/cccDNA (as mentioned above) and an<lb/> increased S-RNA/cccDNA ratio by 1.0 log 10 . This finding<lb/> suggests that the smaller reduction of HBsAg after loss of<lb/> HBeAg than expected from the cccDNA decline might<lb/> be due to an enhanced transcription of S-RNA from<lb/> cccDNA, or possibly transcription of S-RNA from inte-<lb/>grated sequences of HBV DNA that contain the complete<lb/> S region, including the promoter. Such transcription oc-<lb/>curs in the Alexander hepatoma cell line <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>, but whether<lb/> this type of integrations occur during natural infection re-<lb/>mains to be demonstrated.<lb/></p>

			<p>The ratio between HBsAg/S-RNA was unchanged<lb/> after loss of HBeAg, indicating that post-transcriptional<lb/> processing of S-RNA and turnover of subviral particles<lb/> remain unchanged after loss of HBeAg.<lb/></p>

			<p><ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> summarises the main findings in this study,<lb/> pointing out three novel observations for HBeAg-negative<lb/> patients:<lb/> </p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head> 

			<head>Patients<lb/></head>

			<p>From a cross-sectional study of 160 patients with chronic<lb/> HBV infection focusing on histology and HBV DNA levels<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref> a total of 84 patients were included in this study, 16<lb/> positive and 68 negative for HBeAg. The present study is<lb/> an extension of a previous study by our group <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. From<lb/> these patients liver biopsies were available for analysis<lb/> by molecular techniques. None of the patients were co-<lb/>infected with hepatitis C or D viruses, or HIV. The pa-<lb/>tients represented different genotypes and phases of HBV<lb/></p>

Δe indicates<lb/> mean difference between levels in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients. Three novel findings are pointed out: (i) a greater reduction of<lb/> HBV DNA in serum as compared with in the liver; (ii) an unchanged HBsAg/S RNA ratio; (iii) an increased S-RNA/cccDNA ratio, in HBeAg-negative<lb/> as compared with HBeAg-positive patients<lb/> </figure>

			<p>infection. Serum samples that were used for quantification<lb/> of HBV DNA and HBsAg were taken at the time of<lb/> biopsy. All patients gave informed consent and The<lb/> Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg approved<lb/> the study.<lb/></p> 

			<head>Laboratory assessments<lb/></head> 

			<p>Serum HBV DNA was analysed by Cobas Amplicor HBV<lb/> Monitor (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ) and<lb/> HBsAg in serum was quantified using the Architect assay<lb/> (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Portions (approximately 5 mg) of liver biopsies were<lb/> investigated. The liver biopsies were stored in –70 °C<lb/> until analysed. After homogenization of the liver tissue<lb/> in a MagNA Lyser instrument (Roche Diagnostics), ex-<lb/>traction of nucleic acids was performed in the MagNA<lb/> Pure (Roche) robot according to the manufacturer&apos;s<lb/> protocol, using the DNA II Tissue kit.<lb/></p>

			<p>Real-time PCR was performed using primers specific<lb/> for cccDNA as previously described <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. These primers<lb/> amplify a segment spanning the gaps in the plus and<lb/> minus strands of the relaxed circular form of the genome<lb/> that is present in viral particles. Levels of cccDNA were<lb/> normalised to the concentration of human betaglobin<lb/> DNA. Total intrahepatic HBV DNA was analysed by the<lb/> same primers as for pgRNA but without the reverse tran-<lb/>scription step. Part of the extracted NAs was treated with<lb/> DNase (Ambion Inc.), and S-RNA and pgRNA transcripts<lb/> were quantified by real-time PCR after a reverse transcrip-<lb/>tion step (details of the primers are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>).<lb/> Due to the overlap of S and pgRNA transcripts, the S<lb/> primers and probe also detects pgRNA. Normalization of<lb/> RNA levels was made using 18S RNA as reference.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Differences in levels of HBV RNA or DNA between<lb/> groups were analysed by unpaired t-test. Correlations<lb/> were made by linear regression and Pearson&apos;s correlation<lb/> analysis. P values below 0.05 were considered significant.<lb/> The Statview software (SAS Institute) was used for stat-<lb/>istical analyses.<lb/></p>
