			<p>The COVID-19 pandemic began in late 2019 following a zoonotic spillover event of a SARS-<lb/>related coronavirus, subsequently named SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, China <ref type="biblio">[1, 2]</ref>. The extensive<lb/> and rapid global spread of this new human coronavirus and its detrimental impact on human<lb/> health has rendered it among the most significant pandemics in recent history <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Different<lb/> geographical regions of the world have reported varied infection patterns that are attributed to<lb/> differences in population demographics and health care systems, diverse government<lb/> responses <ref type="biblio">[4, 5]</ref>, the emergence of more transmissible variants <ref type="biblio">[6, 7]</ref> and other viral, human<lb/> and population factors. Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has undergone significant genetic<lb/> change such that numerous variants, i.e., distinct genotypes, have been identified <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>, many<lb/> with altered phenotypic properties <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and other public health bodies have broadly classi-<lb/>fied variants that pose an increased risk to global public health (due to increased transmissibil-<lb/>ity, increased virulence or decrease in the effectiveness of public health measures relative to<lb/> 2019/early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 variants) as variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest<lb/> (VOIs) <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. The early SARS-CoV-2 variants to emerge in 2019 and the more transmissible<lb/> +S:D614G variant followed by the VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and currently Omicron)<lb/> have driven significant and sequential &quot;waves&quot; of SARS-CoV-2 infections internationally. The<lb/> emergence of each variant showing a clear geographical link <ref type="biblio">[11-13]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Viral mutations arise from a diverse set of processes (principally viral polymerase replica-<lb/>tion errors and host anti-viral editing processes), which can be identified by the characteristic<lb/> mutational signatures that they leave on the genome <ref type="biblio">[14, 15]</ref>. Such characterisation of domi-<lb/>nant mutational processes is routinely used in cancer genomics <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. The catalogue of SARS-<lb/>CoV-2 nucleotide changes show distinct mutational patterns suggestive of a role for host<lb/> antiviral mutational processes in introducing changes in the viral RNA <ref type="biblio">[17, 18]</ref>. These<lb/> processes potentially dominate in SARS-CoV-2 evolution because point mutations introduced<lb/> in replication are mostly corrected by the action of a proofreading enzyme.<lb/></p>

			<p>The generation of virus diversity, the key to virus persistence by generating novel variation<lb/> and thus evolutionary capacity, is multi-faceted <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>, yet our understanding of the relative<lb/> importance of underlying mutational processes linked to the action of host anti-viral mole-<lb/>cules is still very limited. Given that SARS-CoV-2 continues to develop new variants, many<lb/> associated with sets of previously observed (convergent) and novel mutations <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>, it is critical<lb/> that we improve our understanding of the mechanisms and sources of evolutionary change.<lb/></p>

			<p>Along with routine surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections, there has been an unprece-<lb/>dented global sequencing effort resulting in databases containing many millions of genome<lb/> sequences, in particular GISAID <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Here we examined this data to describe the global<lb/> molecular epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Using regression models we first<lb/> examined how viral properties and public health measures have influenced the magnitude of<lb/> infection waves in different geographic locations. Satisfied that SARS-CoV-2 variants have<lb/> been an important driver of infections we then used non-negative matrix factorisation to char-<lb/>acterise the mutational processes involved in the generation of variants and their changing pat-<lb/>terns of activity over time.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<head>Characterising the SARS-CoV-2 waves regionally<lb/></head>

			<p>This first part of the study reports on global SARS-CoV-2 data from 24/12/2019 to 28/01/<lb/> 2022 only as limited public health measures were in place after this time. We observed 1,544<lb/> distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages from 7,348,178 sequences. 88% of the infections in the global<lb/> pandemic during this time frame were caused by a subset of 13 Pango and WHO variants<lb/> (<ref type="table">S1</ref> Table). While there are geographical differences there is a clear dominance of a subset of<lb/> variants and replacement of these through time (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This &quot;wave&quot; infection pattern was<lb/> evident in all geographic locations. Although biased by testing rates, Europe and the Ameri-<lb/>cas had the highest infection rates, reporting up to 450 cases per million population per day<lb/> (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The emergence or introduction of VOCs coincided with a steep increase in infection<lb/> rates globally. For example, cases in Asia showed a steep rise in February 2021, which peaked<lb/> in May 2021 (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>, panel Asia). During this period, Alpha and Delta comprised greater than<lb/> 75% of the SARS-CoV-2 cases identified in the sequence data. Africa and Oceania on the<lb/> other hand displayed overall sustained low case numbers. Despite this, Beta dominated the<lb/> second wave in parts of Africa while Alpha dominated the third Oceanic wave. After its<lb/> emergence in March 2021, Delta spread to become the predominant variant across all conti-<lb/>nents. The Omicron variant of concern was first identified in South Africa in late November<lb/> 2021 and, by January 2022, it had rapidly become the predominant cause of infections world-<lb/>wide (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Covariates of the waves<lb/></head>

			<p>We investigated the degree to which public health measures and viral properties explain conti-<lb/>nent-specific reported cases of infection. Correlation analysis at the global level showed a sig-<lb/>nificant correlation between infection rates and the predictor variables: government<lb/> stringency, vaccination, previous infection burden, virus diversity and fitness (<ref type="table">S2</ref> Table).<lb/></p>

			<p>Regression analysis revealed that the impact of the predictor variables on the magnitude of<lb/> reported cases were found across all continents. We classified significance levels as follows: no<lb/> significance for p-values greater than 0.05, weak significance for p-values between 0.05 and<lb/> 0.001, and high significance for p-values less than 0.001. Our findings indicated that<lb/> government stringency had a weakly significant impact in Asia, Europe, and South America,<lb/> but a strongly significant impact in Africa, Oceania, and North America. Virus fitness, previ-<lb/>ous infection burden, and vaccination demonstrated a strongly significant impact across all<lb/> continents. Virus diversity was strongly correlated with high infection numbers in Europe and<lb/></p>

Lines show a 14-day rolling average of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases.<lb/> Bars show the biweekly proportions of common lineages and are coloured by lineage. The white space shows the proportion of sequences from<lb/> other (non-majority) lineages.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011795.g001<lb/></figure>

			<p>North America, with a weaker association in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and South America. The R<lb/> squared values, indicating the proportion of variance explained by our model, were greater<lb/> than 0.5 for all continents, ranging from 0.66 in Oceania to 0.79 in Africa (<ref type="table">S3</ref> Table). Gener-<lb/>ally, our predictions closely resembled the rise and fall of SARS-CoV-2 infection case numbers<lb/> (Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>For country-level analysis, we included 29 countries from six continents based on the com-<lb/>pleteness of data (availability of sequence data in every 14 day bin). Pandemic plots were visu-<lb/>alised using biweekly bins and multiple linear regression was fitted using the same approach.<lb/> Different countries had varying lineage dynamics as illustrated in <ref type="figure">S1</ref> Fig. The five predictor<lb/> variables had varying impacts on infection rates across countries (<ref type="figure">S2</ref> Fig). Despite some differ-<lb/>ences related to the population level processes investigated here, there is a clear variant replace-<lb/>ment process taking place. As the generation of novel variants is fundamentally a mutation<lb/> dependent process we next investigated the underlying patterns of mutations being generated<lb/> through time. The goodness of fit varied among countries, with the R squared varying from<lb/> 0.28 (Japan) to 0.96 (Australia), with a median of 0.69 (<ref type="table">S4</ref> Table). Though our model success-<lb/>fully captured the general infection wave patterns in many countries, it struggled to capture<lb/> short-term data spikes in specific instances, such as in Belgium (November 2020), India (May<lb/> 2021), Indonesia (August 2021) and Japan (September 2021) (<ref type="figure">S2</ref> Fig).<lb/></p>

			<head>Identifying putative mutational processes contributing to changes in<lb/> SARS-CoV-2<lb/></head>

			<p>New variants of concern have displaced viral lineages that were previously dominant in the<lb/> population in different geographical regions and in some cases globally (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). This behaviour<lb/> has been observed with the original variants of concern (Alpha, Beta and Gamma) and then<lb/> globally with the Delta and Omicron lineages. We investigated whether these variant wave<lb/> events (periods of time where infections are dominated by a single variant) were linked to the<lb/> activity of specific mutational processes. Each of the variants of interest/concern has evolved<lb/> independently such that detecting the patterns of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence data<lb/> allows us to observe which processes are most active and could be contributing to the emer-<lb/>gence of variants.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mutations were called using inferred references for each of the Pango lineages, which we<lb/> call tree-based referencing (<ref type="figure">S3</ref> Fig). The SARS-CoV-2 alignment of 13,278,844 sequences up to<lb/> 26/10/2022 was used. Of these 13 million sequences 2,195,182 sequences were selected as they<lb/> contained 5,726,144 newly arisen mutations. Cytosine to thymine mutations (C!T) were the<lb/> most common and were the primary substitution category for most weeks where sequences<lb/> were recorded. Note, SARS-CoV-2 has an RNA genome but we refer to uracil as a thymine to<lb/> match pre-existing DNA mutational signature notations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Three signatures were identified with distinct substitution patterns using non-negative<lb/> matrix factorisation (NMF) (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">S5</ref> Fig). Signature 1 is heavily biased towards C!T<lb/> mutations. Signature 1 had a high probability of ACA, ACT and TCT contexts (adjacent nucle-<lb/>otides in the 5&apos; and 3&apos; direction of the mutated site), consistent with what was earlier reported<lb/> by Simmonds et al. <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref> as highly mutated contexts for C!T substitutions in SARS-CoV-2.<lb/> Signature 2 is predominantly adenine to guanine (A!G), guanine to adenine (G!A) and thy-<lb/>mine to cytosine (T!C) mutations. The proportion of A!G and T!C mutations is approxi-<lb/>mately equal in this signature, which is indicative of a double-stranded mutational process.<lb/> SARS-CoV-2 mutations at adenine positions on the negative strand will be counted as thymine<lb/> mutations due to the negative strand being used to replicate positive sense RNA, with the<lb/> mutated A!G now pairing with a cytosine on the +sense RNA and replacing the original thy-<lb/>mine <ref type="biblio">[21, 22]</ref>. Signature 3 is predominantly composed of guanine to thymine (G!T)<lb/> substitutions.<lb/></p>

			<head>The dynamics of mutational processes through the pandemic<lb/></head>

			<p>By using the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences we can measure the mutational signature activ-<lb/>ity across time as long as our samples are aggregated using time series annotations. Signature<lb/> exposures (Fig <ref type="biblio">4</ref>) show that Signature 1 remained the most prominent signature throughout<lb/> the pandemic, although following the emergence of Signature 2 its activity reduced propor-<lb/>tionally. Absolute exposure values (Fig <ref type="figure">4B</ref>) show that Signature 1 does not appear to reduce its<lb/> exposure, rather Signature 2 increases its exposure. Signature 2 establishes itself as a substantial<lb/> signature after December 2020. It continues to expand after October 2021, just prior to the<lb/> emergence of the Delta VOC. Signature 3 is by far the least active of the three signatures but<lb/> remains consistent until after January-February 2022 when it begins to drop towards zero.<lb/> This is around the time Omicron began to emerge as the dominant VOC.<lb/></p>

			<p>Combined signature activity reached a peak between July and October 2021 (Fig <ref type="figure">4B</ref>) coin-<lb/>ciding with the peak number of unique mutations (Fig <ref type="figure">5A and 5B</ref>). This is around the time the<lb/> mutational signature dynamics appear to be shifting, with Signature 2 contributing more<lb/> unique mutations. We can see that this also coincides with the Delta VOC wave, which,<lb/> between May 2021 and January 2022, was the lineage group showing the greatest number of<lb/> newly acquired mutations (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Delta was the first VOC to dominate on a global scale, out-<lb/>competing other VOCs like Alpha, Beta and Gamma in their regions of circulation. Omicron<lb/> similarly repeated this phenomenon, almost entirely replacing Delta globally within weeks of<lb/> its emergence (Fig <ref type="figure">5B</ref>). We also see a marked decrease in the activity of Signature 3 following<lb/> Omicron&apos;s establishment as the dominant variant. A similar decrease in G!T mutations was<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 3. Mutational signatures extracted from the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences by non-negative matrix factorisation. Signatures are patterns of probabilities for<lb/> each category of substitution in a three nucleotide context. Each bar represents a context and is coloured by the substitution category of the mutation that occurs there.<lb/> Each signature may represent a distinct mutational process. Signature 1 is heavily biased towards cytosine to thymine (C!T) mutations, particularly in 3&apos; CpG<lb/> contexts TCG, CCG and ACG. Signature 2 from SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly adenine to guanine (A!G), guanine to adenine (G!A) and thymine to cytosine<lb/> mutations (T!C). Signature 3 is strongly guanine to thymine (G!T), a pattern that is thought to be caused by the action of guanine oxidation by reactive oxygen<lb/> species. Signatures are shown normalised against the tri-nucleotide composition of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Non-normalised forms in the context of the SARS-CoV-<lb/>2 genome composition are shown in S5 Fig.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011795.g003<lb/></figure>

			<p>also observed by Bloom et al. <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref> and Ruis et al. <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref>. This is different to Delta, where there<lb/> was an increase in Signature 3 following its emergence. These Signature 3 changes become par-<lb/>ticularly apparent when we begin to look at signature activities within variant-defined subsets<lb/> of the data.<lb/></p>

			<head>Signature dynamics spatially and by variant<lb/></head>

			<p>After observing changes in signature activity during transitions between dominant variants,<lb/> we next investigated the differences between signature activities in variant-defined subsets of<lb/> the data as well as in continent-defined subsets. We used the globally extracted signatures to<lb/> extract exposures from the subsets using a non-negative least squares regression to retain the<lb/> non-negativity constraint. This allowed for the measurement of signature activity in each of<lb/> the subsets of interest.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 4. Signature exposure plots showing the activities of the extracted mutation signatures over the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. A.<lb/> Shows the percentage activity of the signatures during a given week of the pandemic, with each colour representing a different signature. B. Shows the<lb/> signature activities as their absolute values at each epidemic week.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011795.g004<lb/></figure>

			<p>Signature 1 was the most active in almost all the variant-defined subsets as was expected<lb/> from the global activity. Signature 3 was most active in the Delta subset as well as during the<lb/> Delta wave in the continent-defined subsets (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The non-VOC, Beta and Omicron subsets<lb/> appear to be the least impacted by Signature 3 with almost zero activity in Omicron. Signature<lb/> 2 also shows low activity in the non-VOC subset but is very active in the other VOC subsets, in<lb/> particular Alpha, where it appears to be the most active, overtaking the Signature 1 process.<lb/></p>

			<p>Continent-defined subsets of the data also consistently showed the high activity of Signa-<lb/>ture 1. Signature 2 begins to consistently appear in all continents after 2020, with only small<lb/> bursts of activity being detected before this (Fig <ref type="figure">5D</ref>), again consistent with what we see in the<lb/> global data. Signature 3 activity also follows the pattern of the global activity, appearing most<lb/> prominently during the Delta wave.<lb/></p>

			<head>Bridging the gap between mutation signatures and amino acid<lb/> substitutions<lb/></head>

			<p>Stratifying non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions by their association with mutational sig-<lb/>natures should provide insights into how these mutational processes affect viral proteins.<lb/> Exposures were calculated by stratifying nucleotide mutations by whether they were synony-<lb/>mous or non-synonymous substitutions for each dataset (Fig <ref type="figure">6A</ref>). The unattributed exposure<lb/></p>

B.<lb/> Counts of unique mutations per week that are part of the mutational signature substitution-context features (i.e., no indel mutations included). Colours<lb/> represent which lineage/group of lineages the mutations belong to. C. Ridgeline plot showing the exposure of mutational signatures in SARS-CoV-2<lb/> variant-defined subsets. Exposures are coloured by the signature they have been attributed to. D.

			<figure>Fig 6. A. Exposures for each of the SARS-CoV-2 mutational signatures for both synonymous and non-synonymous stratified datasets. Synonymous exposures are<lb/> below 0 on the y-axis, while non-synonymous exposures are above 0. Each area represents signature exposures across epidemic weeks, with colours representing which<lb/> signature the exposures are attributed to. B. Non-synonymous and synonymous mutations in the tree-based references of identified variants of concern. Signature 1<lb/> produces the majority of both synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in all lineages. Signature 3 mutations are more often non-synonymous substitutions in<lb/> the lineages of concern, with most lineages having few to no changes. Signature 2 non-synonymous mutations appear to have increased in the Omicron lineages (BA.1<lb/> and BA.2). C. Variant of concern associated non-synonymous mutations coloured by the mutational signature with the greatest likelihood of causing the change. D.<lb/> Variant of concern synonymous mutations coloured by the putative mutational process that caused the change.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011795.g006<lb/></figure>

			<p>was calculated using the model error for mutational categories not contained within any of the<lb/> extracted mutational signatures. The majority of non-synonymous substitutions can be<lb/> described by the observed mutational signatures. Signature 1 likely produces most of the non-<lb/>synonymous mutations, however, Signature 3 is an almost exclusively non-synonymous signa-<lb/>ture, with particularly high activity during the Delta wave of infections. Signature 2 appears to<lb/> produce predominantly synonymous mutations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Using the tree-based references, we can also look at individual lineage reference sequences<lb/> to observe which mutational processes have probably produced their specific amino acid sub-<lb/>stitution set. The tree-based references were used since they are equivalent to a high-quality<lb/> representative sequence and because many of the early real sequences contain sequencing<lb/> errors. For each variant of concern, mutations were assigned to a signature by calculating the<lb/> maximum likelihood of the mutation and its context being produced by each of the three<lb/> extracted signatures. Using the trinucleotide context C[C ! T]G as an example, the likelihood<lb/> function is P(C[C ! T]G j Signature), which corresponds to the probability bars for CT-CCT<lb/> in the extracted signatures. Mutations that contained substitution-context pairs not found<lb/> within any of the mutational signatures were labeled as &quot;unattributed&quot;.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Alpha VOC tree-based reference sequence contains eleven Signature 1 changes, six Sig-<lb/>nature 2 changes and a single Signature 3 change. Signature 1 changes account for 39% of all<lb/> substitutions within the Alpha tree-reference sequence, with 75% of these mutations being<lb/> non-synonymous substitutions. Signature 1 was frequently active prior to the Alpha VOC&apos;s<lb/> emergence. The activity plots (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>) show that this was the case for much of the pandemic,<lb/> particularly prior to the Alpha&apos;s emergence around September 2020. It should be noted that<lb/> while Signature 1 mutations are by far the most frequent, only one is found within the Spike<lb/> protein (producing the S:T716I change). Signature 3 only had one change, which was non-syn-<lb/>onymous appearing in ORF:8. Signature 2 mutations were non-synonymous substitutions<lb/> 83% of the time, with three Spike mutations relating to the process including S:D614G, which<lb/> is present within all known variants of concern.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Beta VOC emerged around the same time as Alpha (Autumn 2020) and is defined by a<lb/> smaller set of mutations. A greater proportion of Signature 1 mutations are non-synonymous<lb/> substitutions in Beta (66%). Signature 2 mutations resulted in S:D215G and S:E484K, the latter<lb/> reported to help the virus evade neutralising antibodies <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>. Signature 3 mutations most likely<lb/> produced S:K417N in spike, which is also reported to aid in antibody evasion <ref type="biblio">[25, 26]</ref> similar<lb/> to S:E484K.<lb/></p>

			<p>Gamma also emerged in Autumn 2020 and has 33 different defining substitutions. Signa-<lb/>ture 1 mutations account for 11 of these with 54% being non-synonymous. Four are present in<lb/> Spike including S:L18F, S:P26S, S:H655Y and S:T1027I. Signature 2 mutations resulted in six<lb/> amino acid substitutions, with only 75% of changes being non-synonymous. Three of the five<lb/> mutations in non-synonymous substitutions occurred in Spike. Signature 3 mutations in the<lb/> Gamma lineage were all non-synonymous except for a single synonymous substitution in<lb/> ORF1a/b.<lb/></p>

			<p>Delta was the first VOC to dominate worldwide and replace almost every other lineage in<lb/> all regions. The initial Delta sequence (Pango lineage B.1.617.2) contains six Signature 1 muta-<lb/>tions. 66% of these changes were non-synonymous and none occurred within Spike. Signature<lb/> 2 mutations were all non-synonymous and displaced throughout the virus ORFs including<lb/> ORF1a/b, S and M. Signature 3 mutations in Delta are found in non-coding regions and N,<lb/> with the N mutations both being non-synonymous.<lb/></p>

			<p>Omicron is the most recent VOC to emerge, quickly replacing Delta globally. Omicron dif-<lb/>fers from earlier VOCs with a much greater number of Spike mutations relative to the other<lb/> ORFs. The first identified Omicron variant B.1.1.529 has 40 substitutions of which 32 are non-<lb/>synonymous changes. This is almost double that of Delta, which only had 18. Seven of these<lb/> substitutions were Signature 1 changes, two were Signature 3 and ten were Signature 2<lb/> changes. There are four non-synonymous ORF1a/b mutations despite this ORF being substan-<lb/>tially longer than SARS-CoV-2&apos;s other ORFs. Only one Spike substitution was synonymous<lb/> out of the 21 total changes. This number is even greater when looking at the major Omicron<lb/> variants BA.1 and BA.2. BA.1 had 31 non-synonymous substitutions in Spike alone while BA.2<lb/> had 28. Between these three Omicron variants, only two Spike substitutions are non-synony-<lb/>mous out of a total of 40. Nine of the 40 changes are from Signature 1, 2 are from Signature 3<lb/> and 12 are from Signature 2. This means 23/40 of the changes appear to come from these three<lb/> mutational processes. 20 of the 40 substitutions observed in these variants were present in the<lb/> receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Omicron, with nine of these changes thought to help Omi-<lb/>cron evade the immune response or increase its transmissibility [27]. Of these beneficial RBD<lb/> changes, three are potentially the result of Signature 1 activity, 9 are Signature 2 and one is<lb/> from Signature 3. The high density of Signature 2 RBD amino acid changes in a variant that<lb/> has emerged as Signature 2 exposure increased suggests that the mutational process behind<lb/> Signature 2 may have contributed to the emergence of the Omicron variant.<lb/></p>

			<head>Signature exposures and highly mutated sequences in wastewater data<lb/></head>

			<p>Similar trends over time in exposures are seen when the mutational signatures are applied to<lb/> publicly available wastewater data. Although the trend is seen at a lower resolution than global<lb/> data, Signature 1 and Signature 3 are gradually replaced by Signature 2 (Fig <ref type="figure">7A</ref>). Although, Sig-<lb/>nature 2 is not quite as strong as in the global data (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>). This suggests trends in mutational<lb/> processes can be monitored using wastewater, not only sequencing of the infected population.<lb/> Additionally, at time periods where a high level of virus diversity is expected, there are highly<lb/> mutated sequences present in the wastewater (Fig <ref type="figure">7C</ref>). This suggests cryptic sequences in<lb/> wastewater may be used to observe potential upcoming variants, similar to how known<lb/> sequences have been back-traced to particular buildings using wastewater <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>As chronic SARS-CoV-2 infections are implicated as a major contributor to VOC evolution<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[29, 30]</ref>, it may be possible to parse highly-mutated cryptic sequences of interest from chronic<lb/> infections out of wastewater data in the interest of detecting potential VOCs. Unfortunately,<lb/> this is problematic to deconvolve as sequencing data for immunocompromised and chroni-<lb/>cally infected individuals is sparse. When sequences from known chronic infections are exam-<lb/>ined, the distribution of mutation types is consistent with global data, with Signature 1<lb/> mutations dominating as expected for samples from January 2022 (Fig <ref type="figure">7B</ref>). Although, due to<lb/> the low number of chronic infections for comparison this result is not very conclusive, it does<lb/> demonstrate how mutational patterns can be potentially detected in this type of data. Studying<lb/> these types of infections, and underlying mutational processes, will be important to under-<lb/>stand better the origins of the sets of mutations that contribute to the generation of VOCs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>In this study, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics and identified temporal variables<lb/> that are associated with increased numbers of infection cases. Both public health measures and<lb/> virus properties were associated with the sequential waves of regional SARS-CoV-2 infections<lb/> cases. These predictors have varying impact in different geographical locations. As more of the<lb/> global population&apos;s immune system becomes sensitised to existing SARS-CoV-2 variants,<lb/> either through previous infection or vaccination, the virus has and will continue to undergo<lb/> changes that enable reinfections. The continued emergence of new variants is thus expected.<lb/> In some regions, government stringency had limited significant impact on patterns of<lb/> infection. This could be due to differences in implementation strategies and support, other<lb/> competing predictor variables, as well as behavioural changes in citizens as a response to the<lb/> restrictions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our analysis highlights the significant role of vaccination in influencing reported COVID-<lb/>19 case patterns across all continents, even in regions with lower vaccination coverage like<lb/> Africa. Despite Africa&apos;s lower vaccination rates, the continent has seen a relatively low-level of<lb/> sustained transmission. This phenomenon might be attributed to factors such as the younger<lb/> median age of the population, lower population density, immune priming due to prevalent<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 7. A. Signature exposures per month from wastewater sequences show similar trends in mutational processes as the global data, although at a lower<lb/> resolution and, interestingly, with a lower Signature 2 exposure. B. Substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences from infections of<lb/> immunocompromised individuals contain mutation types corresponding with patterns observed in the distinct signatures. Of note, there are more<lb/> synonymous mutations present in the chronic infection data than in the global sequences, although it is important to note the sample size for<lb/> immunocompromised infections is low. C. Mutation counts in wastewater sequences for bi-yearly time periods. Highly mutated sequences cluster to<lb/> the right especially during the 2021 July-December time period, as would be expected when Omicron was emerging.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011795.g007<lb/></figure>

			<p>infectious diseases, and limited testing capacity <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref>. The weak impact of viral diversity on<lb/> reported cases in Asia and South America may be explained by the emergence and dominance<lb/> of variants such Delta and Gamma in the regions, respectively. For instance, the Delta variant,<lb/> initially identified in Asia, quickly became the predominant strain, overshadowing other line-<lb/>ages before spreading globally. Overall, the predictor variables significantly contributed to<lb/> explaining the rise and fall of infection numbers across different continents, accounting for<lb/> more than half of the variance in reported cases. The differences in the regression effectiveness<lb/> can be attributed to intrinsic differences among continents, such as variations in vaccine cov-<lb/>erage, testing and sequencing capabilities, and the effectiveness of government stringency<lb/> measures.<lb/></p>

			<p>While our model effectively captured the general trends of infection waves, it struggled to<lb/> accurately represent peaks within short time-frames in some countries. This discrepancy<lb/> might be attributed to the omission of certain predictor variables, like mass gatherings, which<lb/> are known to contribute to viral super-spreading events <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In utilizing the OWID and OxCGRT datasets, which are arguably among the most compre-<lb/>hensive for addressing our research objectives, we note some limitations. First, there were dis-<lb/>crepancies in parameter definitions, such as varying case classifications across regions. Second,<lb/> positive tests are commonly labeled based on their reporting date rather than &quot;date-of-event&quot;<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. Lastly, the cases reported in these datasets may not be fully representative of the actual<lb/> disease burden. Although the Human Development Index (HDI) of a country can act as a<lb/> proxy to bridge the gap between reported cases and the true disease burden, it does not fully<lb/> capture the entire complexity.<lb/></p>

			<p>The extracted signatures from the global SARS-CoV-2 dataset show clear and distinct pat-<lb/>terns describing mutational processes acting on the viral genome. The most prominent of<lb/> these signatures, Signature 1 (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">S5</ref> Fig), shows a marked bias towards C!T mutations,<lb/> a signal indicative of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases <ref type="biblio">[17, 18]</ref>. APOBEC enzymes<lb/> have been shown to cause extensive C!T editing of DNA and RNA in human and viral<lb/> genomes. However, it is not yet clear whether they are the cause of this pronounced C!T bias<lb/> in SARS-CoV-2 despite a number of other studies also observing other APOBEC-like muta-<lb/>tional patterns <ref type="biblio">[34-37]</ref>. Cytosines flanked by either an adenine or thymine in both the 3&apos; and<lb/> 5&apos; direction appear to be the most pronounced targets of Signature 1. APOBEC editing was<lb/> shown to have contexts outside of the traditional TpC when structural features of the nucleic<lb/> acid such as hairpin loops are present <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>. Outside of structural features, APOBEC3A is<lb/> thought to be the predominant cause for TpC changes and is found to be expressed in lung tis-<lb/>sue <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>. ApC changes are considered to be caused by APOBEC1, which in cell models was<lb/> shown to efficiently edit SARS-CoV-2 RNA <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>. APOBEC1 is found predominately in the<lb/> liver and small intestine, tissues reported to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 <ref type="biblio">[39, 40]</ref>. 3&apos; CpG nucle-<lb/>otide contexts are the most targeted, in particular TCG, CCG and ACG. CpG suppression is a<lb/> well-known dinucleotide bias. In RNA viruses, this appears to be a result of selective pressures<lb/> exerted from the presence of host CpG sensing molecules such as Zinc-finger Antiviral Protein<lb/> (ZAP). ZAP relies on host CpG suppression to allow it to specifically target non-host genomic<lb/> material (such as viral RNA) with higher CpG content <ref type="biblio">[41]</ref>. This allows viruses with lower<lb/> CpG content to better evade restriction by ZAP since it more closely resembles the host CpG<lb/> composition. While ZAP does not induce C!T changes, it may help explain why C!T sites<lb/> in a CpG 3&apos; context are preferentially edited relative to other 3&apos; contexts. ZAP has been shown<lb/> to restrict SARS-CoV-2 despite pre-existing CpG depletion <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref>. ZAP isoforms have been<lb/> shown to prevent necessary translational frame-shifting for SARS-CoV-2 ORF1b protein pro-<lb/>duction. <ref type="biblio">[43]</ref>. The non-normalised form of Signature 1 (<ref type="figure">S5</ref> Fig) shows that when tri-nucleotide<lb/> bias is not accounted for 3&apos; CpG&apos;s are lower than the normalised signatures, yet 5&apos; TpC and<lb/> ApC contexts remain the most prevalent(<ref type="figure">S5</ref> Fig). The most targeted contexts do shift to ACA,<lb/> ACT and TCT, likely reflecting their comparatively high abundance within the SARS-CoV-2<lb/> genome relative to 3&apos;CpG contexts. These non-normalised contexts are consistent with what<lb/> was earlier reported by Simmonds et al. <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Signature 2 (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">S5</ref> Fig) has a nearly identical proportion of A!G and T!C muta-<lb/>tions. These are a known target of the ADAR family of adenine deaminases. ADAR enzymes<lb/> typically operate on double-stranded RNA and convert adenine into inosine <ref type="biblio">[21, 22]</ref>. Inosine<lb/> forms base pairs with cytosine, which after another round of replication causes guanine to<lb/> replace the inosine and complete the A!G change. As ADAR operates on both strands of<lb/> dsRNA, the mutational signature resulting from the process is expected to contain an equal<lb/> proportion of A!G and T!C mutations, which is the case for Signature 2 <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. Signature 2<lb/> also contains a number of G!A mutations, which could be caused by low-level C!T activity<lb/> on the negative sense RNA strand. Due to the cellular strand biases present between the posi-<lb/>tive and negative sense RNA <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>, C!T mutational processes acting on ssRNA are much less<lb/> likely to produce a mutation on the negative strand (resulting in G!A substitutions) than<lb/> C!T changes on the positive strand. The negative strand will only be present during the repli-<lb/>cation phase of the virus while the positive strand will be present both on cell entry and on exit<lb/> as the new viral particles are packaged to infect further cells. This could explain why the nega-<lb/>tive sense Signature 1 changes are present in Signature 2, since it may be operating at a similar<lb/> level to Signature 2 on the negative strand. The non-normalised form of Signature 2 (<ref type="figure">S5</ref> Fig)<lb/> does have different targeted contexts, just as with Signature 1. However, the main attribute of<lb/> Signature 2 is its equal contributions of A!G and T!C substitutions, which still remain<lb/> equal.<lb/></p>

			<p>Signature 3 (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> and <ref type="figure">S5</ref> Fig) is dominated by G!T substitutions. A putative mechanism<lb/> for this is Reactive Oxygen Species(ROS) in the cell. Increases in oxidative stress as part of a<lb/> ROS &apos;burst&apos; have been associated with viruses during the early stages of infection <ref type="biblio">[34, 44]</ref>. Gua-<lb/>nine nucleotides are known to be vulnerable to oxidation, with the product 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-<lb/>2&apos;-deoxyguanine (oxoguanine) pairing with adenine bases rather than cytosine <ref type="biblio">[44, 45]</ref>. Similar<lb/> to inosine causing A!G changes, this change to oxoguanine will result in a G!T mutation<lb/> after a replication cycle. The lack of C!A changes in the signature also suggests that the mech-<lb/>anism is most active on the positive single-stranded RNA rather than the negative single-<lb/>stranded RNA. The initial positive single-stranded RNA is found in the cytoplasm, meaning it<lb/> can be easily accessed by ROS and other mechanisms of mutation. Viral replication is thought<lb/> to take place within membrane-bound environments that aim to protect the RNA. The pres-<lb/>ence of double-stranded RNA within these environments strongly suggests that this is the case<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[46]</ref> and may explain the relative lack of negative strand mutations in SARS-CoV-2 signatures.<lb/> The non-normalised G!T signature (S5 Fig) seems to display a context preference of TpG and<lb/> ApG nucleotides, although this contextual bias is changed to CpG and ApG following normali-<lb/>sation. These contextual biases mean that the signature could be some other as yet unknown<lb/> editing mechanism on the viral RNA, although normalisation changing this context so heavily<lb/> suggests that this bias perhaps has more to do with genome composition. The increased CpG<lb/> context shift post-normalisation could also be another ZAP-induced effect, where CpG deple-<lb/>tion is selected for to help the virus evade ZAP. Curiously, this G!T bias has been observed in<lb/> other coronaviruses, but not widely among RNA viruses <ref type="biblio">[47]</ref>. ROS has a verified cancer muta-<lb/>tional signature <ref type="biblio">[15, 48]</ref> although the context preferences do not match the signatures (normal-<lb/>ised or non-normalised) observed here. However, there are a multitude of differences between<lb/> viral RNA and human DNA that make these signatures difficult to compare.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is important to note that while SARS-CoV-2 does have an error correction mechanism<lb/> resulting in fewer replicase-induced errors, this mechanism will not catch all changes. A<lb/> number of the mutations picked up from the set of sequences (and included in our mutational<lb/> signatures) will be derived from replication errors. However, the clear and repeatable extrac-<lb/>tion of the signatures indicates that despite this potential contamination, the extracted signa-<lb/>tures do appear to be predominantly other mutational processes. While a replication error-<lb/>associated mutational signature may be identified in future, this signature is too diffuse to<lb/> identify as a distinct process. Similarly, a high proportion of mutations are not accounted for<lb/> by the extracted mutational signatures. These mutations were not present in large enough<lb/> quantities to enable effective extraction from the data. Future methods may be able to tease out<lb/> the more subtle mutational mechanisms that almost certainly exist to induce these less com-<lb/>mon mutation types.<lb/></p>

			<p>Signature activities clearly change in both the global dataset and in the various subsets of<lb/> the data for VOCs and continents. In the global data (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>) Signature 1 is dominant through-<lb/>out the pandemic. Signature 2 only begins to appear around November 2020, after which it<lb/> appears consistently active for the remainder of the pandemic. This is approximately when<lb/> variant of concern lineages began to emerge, as well as the beginning of the first vaccine roll-<lb/>outs. This is particularly apparent in the Alpha subset where Signature 2 is the most highly<lb/> active mutational process (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>), with a large depletion of Signature 1 activity as well.<lb/></p>

			<p>Alpha was shown to increase sub-genomic RNA expression of several immune-antagonist<lb/> viral proteins including nucleocapsid (N), ORF9b and ORF6 <ref type="biblio">[49-52]</ref>. N is thought to shield<lb/> dsRNA from detection by RNA sensors, which trigger downstream antiviral response path-<lb/>ways <ref type="biblio">[49, 52-54]</ref>. ORF9b antagonises TOM70, a protein required for the activation of mito-<lb/>chondrial antiviral-signalling proteins (MAVS) <ref type="biblio">[49]</ref> while ORF6 inhibits the transportation to<lb/> the nucleus of inflammatory transcription factors <ref type="biblio">[55]</ref>. Combined, the cumulative immune<lb/> inhibition may have resulted in an observable change in the mutational processes that we<lb/> observe within the Alpha lineage. Beta and Gamma (both VOCs that emerged around the<lb/> same time as Alpha) gained amino acid substitutions that helped evade the immune system<lb/> primarily via antigenic change. Alpha&apos;s reliance on attenuating immune pathways rather than<lb/> antibody binding may be why we see a different signature exposure pattern in this VOC rela-<lb/>tive to the others. This could be due to the attenuated pathways being involved in signalling for<lb/> the mutational processes behind Signatures 1 and 3, while not inhibiting Signature 2 as much.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>This Alpha pattern is not observed in the other VOC datasets, although Delta and Omicron<lb/> have a high level of Signature 2 exposure as well, despite Signature 1 remaining the dominant<lb/> process in those subsets. Signature 3 appears to be most prominently found in the Delta subset<lb/> and remains consistently at low levels in the global data until January 2022 when it appears to<lb/> disappear almost entirely. The Omicron subset has little to no exposure for Signature 3 and<lb/> this happens to be the VOC almost exclusively circulating after January 2022. Why Omicron<lb/> appears to have so little Signature 3 exposure is unclear, although unlike previous VOCs, Omi-<lb/>cron differs in its preference of cell entry mechanism. Previous variants of the virus typically<lb/> enter the cell using membrane fusion, where the viral membrane fuses with the cell membrane<lb/> via the action of ACE-2 receptor binding and TMPRSS2 cleavage of the spike protein. Omi-<lb/>cron instead favours an endosomal route of entry whereby the viral particle binds to the cell<lb/> using ACE-2 and is enveloped by endocytosis into the cell. Cleavage of the spike protein then<lb/> occurs via the action of Cathepsin L, which allows for the release of the viral RNA into the<lb/> cytoplasm of the now-infected cell <ref type="biblio">[56, 57]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Signature transitions from Signature 1 to Signature 2 changes occur from December 2020<lb/> onwards in the global dataset and appears consistently in the VOC and continent-defined sub-<lb/>sets around this time point as well. Alpha underwent a major shift to Signature 2 mutations<lb/> early in its time as a VOC, although Signature 1 returned as the predominant set of changes<lb/> towards the end of its wave of infections. The non-VOC subset appears to be the least impacted<lb/> by Signature 2 changes. However, this can mostly be explained by the number of non-VOC<lb/> sequences quickly declining after the emergence of the VOC lineages. Delta underwent a dra-<lb/>matic increase in Signature 2 and Signature 3 exposure from July 2021, with Signature 2<lb/> becoming the predominant signature towards the end of Deltas wave. Signature 2 changes<lb/> continue into Omicrons introduction, although it does decrease after the initial BA.1 wave<lb/> from December 2021 to March 2022. It seems clear that while Signature 1 mutations have<lb/> dominated in contributing to the evolutionary capacity of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the pan-<lb/>demic, this mutational environment is beginning to change. Such shifts in mutational pro-<lb/>cesses are potentially evidence of changing interactions between the viruses and the immune<lb/> systems of the hosts they circulate within. For example, changes in population-level immunity<lb/> via vaccination or previous infections may influence the mutations that we observe in the data.<lb/> Changing mutational process activity in consensus sequences from infections is unlikely to<lb/> fully reflect the true activity of each process, but they are likely to show which processes are<lb/> contributing mutations that eventually make it into circulating viruses.<lb/></p>

			<p>All variants of concern we assessed show predominantly non-synonymous mutations and<lb/> all mutational signatures are associated with more non-synonymous than synonymous<lb/> changes. More synonymous substitutions in the lineage references were found in ORF1a/b,<lb/> which is expected due to it being the longest ORF. However, this pattern is not observed with<lb/> non-synonymous mutations as these are mainly located in the spike protein (Fig <ref type="figure">6C and 6D</ref>).<lb/> This is consistent with spike being under intense immune pressure since it is the main glyco-<lb/>protein for SARS-CoV-2. As such, spike must change in order to escape the host immune<lb/> response, while maintaining its main function of binding and entry into host cells. Signature 1<lb/> changes are the predominant source of mutations in all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs that we analysed,<lb/> followed by unattributed mutations, Signature 2 changes and Signature 3 changes. Signature 3<lb/> changes were unlikely to be synonymous mutations with only Beta, Gamma and Delta con-<lb/>taining very few such changes (Fig <ref type="figure">6D</ref>). This is also reflected in the global synonymous/non-<lb/>synonymous exposures where Signature 3 appears completely inactive in the synonymous<lb/> mutation subset (Fig <ref type="figure">6A</ref>). Signature 2 exposure appears the most likely to be synonymous<lb/> mutations (Fig <ref type="figure">6A</ref>) but this does not seem to be observed in the VOC lineages where most Sig-<lb/>nature 2 changes are non-synonymous mutations (Fig <ref type="figure">6B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, mutational signature analysis reveals important processes contributing to<lb/> SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation and serves as a tool to track the dominant changes over time<lb/> and to generate hypotheses about the main mechanistic processes in play. Specifically, host<lb/> antiviral molecules as opposed to replication errors appear to be a the main generator of muta-<lb/>tions (confirming earlier computational studies), a result that requires experimental confirma-<lb/>tion. Despite limitations in potential biases, our findings contribute to a better understanding<lb/> of the complex dynamics driving the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the emergence of VOCs.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head>

			<head>Data<lb/></head>

			<p>The findings of this study are based on metadata associated with 13,281,213 sequences avail-<lb/>able on GISAID up to October 26, 2022 and accessible at doi.org/10.55876/gis8.221201qs.<lb/> Sequences were filtered to remove records from non-human hosts, with lengths less than<lb/> 20,000 nucleotides, non-assigned lineages, with greater than 30% unknown bases, sequences<lb/> reported to be collected before 24/12/2019 and those with excessive mutations/deletions. The<lb/> cutoff for filtering out hypermutated sequences was 175 mutations in coding regions or more<lb/> than 69 different deletions, the cutoffs were manually determined after evaluation of the<lb/> mutation/deletion distribution and selecting the point where sequence counts were consis-<lb/>tently observed in single digits, this resulted in 1,852 sequences being filtered out.<lb/></p>

			<p>Publicly available daily SARS-CoV-2 cases, tests performed and total vaccinations per capita<lb/> were obtained from OWID <ref type="biblio">[58]</ref> in September 2022. Prior to February 2023, the OWID data<lb/> was piped from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dashboard <ref type="biblio">[33, 59]</ref>. Country-level<lb/> government stringency indices were downloaded from OxCGRT <ref type="biblio">[60]</ref>. Government stringency<lb/> indices are composed of nine indicators: school closure, workplace closure, cancellation of<lb/> public events, stay at home order, public information campaigns, restrictions on public gather-<lb/>ings, public transport, internal movement and international travel. The index on a given day<lb/> ranges from 0 to 100 and is calculated as the mean of the nine indicators, with higher indices<lb/> indicating stricter regulations. If responses vary at sub-national levels, the index at the strictest<lb/> level is used <ref type="biblio">[60]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Wastewater findings are based on metadata associated with 1,343 sequences available on<lb/> GISAID and accessible at doi.org/10.55876/gis8.230406qg. Wastewater sequences were down-<lb/>loaded from the &apos;wastewater data&apos; section of GISAID in December 2022.<lb/></p>

			<p>Sequences for immunocompromised individuals were downloaded from GISAID in<lb/> November 2022. Analysis of this was based on the metadata associated with 34 sequences avail-<lb/>able on GISAID and accessible at doi.org/10.55876/gis8.230406fb. Sequences were chosen<lb/> based on the known list of sequences used in <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref>. Sequences were aligned to the COVID refer-<lb/>ence genome before use.<lb/></p>

			<head>Design<lb/></head>

			<p>Predictors of SARS-CoV-2 reported cases were explored using a linear model at both country<lb/> and continent levels. We collected continuous dependent variables reported on a daily basis.<lb/> These were classified into two groups: (i) public health measures (government stringency, test-<lb/>ing capacity and vaccination), (ii) viral properties (diversity and fitness). We examined the<lb/> data for completeness of predictive variables. In instances of missing vaccination data, we<lb/> interpreted this as no vaccinations having been given. This was a reasonable assumption for<lb/> periods prior to the vaccine rollouts in the respective countries. With the exception of vaccina-<lb/>tions, variables with less than 70% of the countries reporting data were not included. The num-<lb/>ber of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests performed was excluded as a predictor due to missing<lb/> data. We determined the previous burden by summing the adjusted new cases per capita over<lb/> the past 90 days. Prior infection significantly reduces the risk of a subsequent infection, with a<lb/> reduction in risk of up to 95% in the initial three months <ref type="biblio">[61]</ref>. This was included as a predictor<lb/> variable in the linear model.<lb/></p>

			<p>Amino acid substitutions were defined against the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence. Building on<lb/> findings from Obermeyer et al., we extracted a list of previously identified fitness-associated<lb/> mutations <ref type="biblio">[62]</ref>. Each fit mutation within a sequence was counted and the counts were normal-<lb/>ized to the number of sequences per geographical location. Virus fitness was therefore defined<lb/> as the sum of the frequencies of previously identified <ref type="biblio">[62]</ref> amino acid substitutions that<lb/> increase SARS-CoV-2 fitness divided by the sum of total genomes and the log of total muta-<lb/>tions per location.<lb/></p>

			<formula>Virus Fitness ¼<lb/> weekly sum of fit mutations<lb/> total seqs per week þ logðtotal mutations per weekÞ<lb/></formula>

			<p>Diversity was calculated by dividing distinct lineages by the total number of genomes in a<lb/> given week. Sequences reported in GISAID were assumed to be representative of the diversity<lb/> of infections for that continent/country.<lb/></p>

			<head>Linear model<lb/></head>

			<p>We employed a linear regression model, described by Heo et al. <ref type="biblio">[63]</ref>, to adjust reported cases<lb/> per country using the Human Development Index (HDI), which encompasses not just eco-<lb/>nomic growth but also reflects a country&apos;s capacity for per capita testing. Countries with higher<lb/> HDI levels, typically high-income nations, conducted more tests per million people, often lead-<lb/>ing to more confirmed cases compared to nations with lower HDI levels. Adjusted daily cases<lb/> were smoothed using a 14-days rolling average to limit possible noise and identify simplified<lb/> changes over time. For continent-level analysis, data from all contributing countries was used<lb/> to fit the linear model. To ensure that countries with a large number of cases didn&apos;t artificially<lb/> inflate the results, each country&apos;s influence on the continent-level OxCGRT index was adjusted<lb/> based on its percent contribution to the continent&apos;s 14-day average daily case tally.<lb/></p>

			<p>Pearson&apos;s correlation was used to test for correlation among the variables. Multiple linear<lb/> regression was fitted to evaluate the relationship between infection rate (adjusted daily cases<lb/> per capita) as the outcome and the public health measures and viral properties as predictors<lb/> within the different continents. The regression models were fitted on data from 01 April 2020<lb/> onwards, as (sequence) data addition remained stable after this. The country-level analysis was<lb/> carried out for countries with less than 50 days of missing genome data using a similar<lb/> approach.<lb/></p>

			<head>Pandemic plots<lb/></head>

			<p>Case numbers and sequence data were aggregated by their respective continents, a 14-day roll-<lb/>ing average was used to smooth out daily infection rates and categorical variables were sum-<lb/>marised by counts. Proportions of lineages were calculated in 14-days bins and the most<lb/> common lineages were visualised per continent.<lb/></p>

			<head>Tree-based referencing<lb/></head>

			<p>The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 means that the majority of viral sequences are distinct<lb/> from the early pandemic reference genome Wuhan-Hu-1 <ref type="biblio">[64]</ref>. Continuing to count mutations<lb/> against the early reference sequence can result in mutations being allocated the wrong substi-<lb/>tution category (i.e., A!T instead of a C!T) where sites have mutated multiple times. Azgari<lb/> et al. <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref> tackled this issue by building a tree of clustered sequences to remove ancestral muta-<lb/>tions. However, we utilise the available SARS-CoV-2 tree generated as part of the Pango <ref type="biblio">[8]<lb/></ref> nomenclature to generate a reference sequence for each defined lineage. This means that<lb/> sequences from the lineage B.1 are compared against a generated reference sequence for the B<lb/> lineage rather than the Wuhan-1 sequence (See <ref type="figure">S3</ref> Fig for diagrammatic description).<lb/></p>

			<p>One reference sequence was generated for each of the Pango lineages in the alignment. A<lb/> nucleotide was included in the generated Pango reference if it exceeded a frequency threshold<lb/> of greater than 75% of the samples from the lineage. If this threshold was not reached, the ref-<lb/>erence nucleotide of the nearest parental lineage was used (i.e., if a mutation in B.1 is ambigu-<lb/>ous, the nucleotide from the B lineage reference at that position is used). Building intermediate<lb/> references also meant that counting inherited mutations could be avoided. Since mutations<lb/> were identified relative to their nearest parental Pango lineage, inherited mutations are not<lb/> counted because, relative to this sequence, there hasn&apos;t been a mutation. Mutations are also<lb/> only counted once per lineage set of sequences so that mutations that are observed many times<lb/> due spread of the virus rather than acquisition by a mutational process are not over-counted.<lb/> This means that convergent amino acid substitutions can be observed between lineage sets,<lb/> although they may be undercounted within a lineage. However, this is necessary since it is very<lb/> difficult to identify convergence within similar sequences (especially at a global scale).<lb/> Overcounting of the mutations results in mutational signatures that reflect the circulating pre-<lb/>dominant lineages rather than the mutational processes producing the mutations in those<lb/> lineages.<lb/></p>

			<head>Pseudo-sampling<lb/></head>

			<p>Mutations were binned into categories composed of their substitution type (e.g., cytosine !<lb/> thymine = CT) and their mutation context. The mutation context is the mutated base and<lb/> the nucleotides at the 5&apos; and 3&apos; positions of the mutated base. There are a total of 192 types<lb/> of substitution-context matchings that can appear (12 possible single nucleotide changes x<lb/> four possible nucleotide 5&apos; x four possible nucleotide 3&apos;). Every sequence produces a single<lb/> count vector of mutation category counts, with the total count matrix becoming the muta-<lb/>tional catalogue of the virus. On average, a single SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence has very<lb/> few new mutations. As extracting mutational signatures when mutation counts are low is<lb/> unlikely to produce meaningful results, we define each sample as a time-point (all of the<lb/> sequences collected in an epidemic week) and decompose signatures from the counts at<lb/> each time-point rather than from each sequence. This shrinks the mutational catalogue of<lb/> the virus from millions of samples down to less than 200 samples, one for each Epidemic<lb/> Week.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-negative matrix factorisation<lb/></head>

			<p>NMF (non-negative matrix factorisation) <ref type="biblio">[65, 66]</ref> was used to split the mutational catalogue<lb/> into two sub-matrices. One matrix represents the mutational signatures, the other matrix rep-<lb/>resents the exposure of the signatures. These matrices were used to reconstruct the original<lb/> mutational catalogue with some degree of error. To verify the validity of the identified signa-<lb/>tures, NMF was performed 100 times for each value of N, with N representing the number of<lb/> signatures to extract from the mutational catalogue. For this analysis, N was set to 2, . . ., 10.<lb/> For each NMF run, a new mutational catalogue was generated using bootstrap re-sampling of<lb/> the original matrix and removal of any mutational categories that did not account for more<lb/> than 0.5% of mutations. Mutational categories are pseudo-sampled down into epidemic week<lb/> matrices that NMF was run on. The signatures were then clustered together using K-means<lb/> clustering, with the cluster means forming the new signatures. Clusters were then assessed<lb/> using the silhouette score to determine the clustering quality. Clusters with high silhouette<lb/> scores are well separated from other clusters and are dense and well-formed. Cosine similarity<lb/> was used to determine if the signature was reliably extracted from the cluster. The cosine simi-<lb/>larity was calculated between signatures extracted from the whole mutational catalogue and<lb/> the cluster means of the signature clusters. A higher cosine similarity indicates that the cluster<lb/> mean shows a similar pattern to the initial mutational signature. Following the best practices<lb/> in Islam et al. <ref type="biblio">[66]</ref>, an N value of three was selected due to the reduction of the reconstruction<lb/> error plateauing around three and the marked decrease in silhouette score for signatures<lb/> greater than 3. The average cosine similarity between signatures and clusters was consistently<lb/> above 0.95 for each cluster and had an average of 0.98 for all three clusters when clustering was<lb/> repeated 100 times. Silhouette scores for each cluster were above 0.95, suggesting excellent sep-<lb/>aration and density of clusters (<ref type="table">S5</ref> Table and <ref type="figure">S9</ref> Fig). Signatures can therefore be reliably<lb/> extracted from the bootstrapped catalogues, are robust and thus are unlikely to be artefacts.<lb/> Counts of mutations were normalised by the tri-mer composition of the SARS-CoV-2 refer-<lb/>ence sequence (dividing the counts by the number of contexts in the reference sequence).<lb/> Composition biased versions of the signatures were then produced by rescaling the signatures<lb/> using tri-mer composition.<lb/></p>

			<head>Non-negative least squares regression<lb/></head>

			<p>A non-negative least squares (NNLS) Regression was used to produce positive exposure<lb/> weights for each of the signatures in each of the datasets. The non-negativity of the regression<lb/> ensures that the weights of the signatures continue to represent an additive process. The NNLS<lb/> weights can then represent the exposures of the signatures on each dataset.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mutational catalogues were constructed for each continent and each of the Variant of Concern<lb/> (VOC) lineages (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron). The global signatures were then<lb/> used to extract exposures for each of the mutational catalogues to determine how processes<lb/> varied between each mutational catalogue subset. VOC sequence sets were filtered so that<lb/> weeks with fewer than 100 sequences were excluded.</p>
