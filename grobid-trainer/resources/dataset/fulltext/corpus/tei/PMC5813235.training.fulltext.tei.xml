			<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are involved in<lb/> diverse physiological functions including thermosensation<lb/> and chemosensation. <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref> The mammalian TRP superfamily is<lb/> composed of 28 members that are grouped into six subfam-<lb/>ilies based on their amino acid sequence homology: TRPC<lb/> (canonical or classic), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melasta-<lb/>tin), TRPA (ankyrin), TRPP (polycystin) and TRPML (mu-<lb/>colipin). <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> TRPM2, a subtype of TRP-melastatin subfamily<lb/> (TRPM), is a multifunctional Ca 2+ permeable and nonselec-<lb/>tive cation channel. <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> It functions as an important Ca 2+ sig-<lb/>nalling regulator in a variety of cells, contributing to cellular<lb/> functions including cytokine production, insulin release, cell<lb/> motility, oxidative stress and cell death. <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref> TRPM2 is activated<lb/> by reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen perox-<lb/>ide and is considered as a chanzyme containing a unique C-<lb/>terminal Nudix hydrolase domain, that is homologous to the<lb/> ADPR pyrophosphatase nudix hydrolase 9 (NUDT9). <ref type="biblio">[6-8]<lb/></ref> The NUDT9-homology (NUDT9-H) domain serves a binding<lb/> site for channel activation by adenosine 5′-diphosphoribose<lb/> (ADPR). <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> Accumulating evidence shows that TRPM2<lb/> channel plays a critical role in sensing internal body tem-<lb/>perature <ref type="biblio">[9-11]</ref> and is also implicated in many pathological<lb/> processes such as neurodegeneration, <ref type="biblio">[12,13]</ref> diabetes <ref type="biblio">[14,15]</ref> and<lb/> ischemic reperfusion injury, <ref type="biblio">[16,17]</ref> suggesting TRPM2 as a po-<lb/>tential therapeutic target. Therefore, inhibiting TRPM2 may<lb/> lead to a therapeutic potential for ischemicinjury.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the past, several small molecules (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) have been<lb/> reported to show TRPM2 inhibitory activity with variable<lb/> IC 50 (1.2~76 μm), including flufenamic acid (FFA), <ref type="biblio">[18,19]<lb/></ref> 2-(3-methylphenyl) aminobenzoic acid (3-MFA), <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> N-(p-<lb/>amylcinnamoyl) anthranilic acid (ACA), <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref> econazole, clotri-<lb/>mazole <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref> and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). <ref type="biblio">[22,23]<lb/></ref> However, none of them show any specificity against TRPM2<lb/> channel. <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref> For instance, 2-APB activates TRPV1, TRPV2<lb/> and TRPV3. <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref> In addition, several nucleotide analogues such<lb/> as adenosine monophosphate (AMP), 8-bromoadenosine<lb/> 5′-diphosphoribose (8-Br-ADPR) have also been reported to be<lb/> TRPM2 inhibitors (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). <ref type="biblio">[26,27]</ref> Recently, a series of ADPR<lb/> analogues mainly modified at C-8 position of purine such as<lb/> 8-phenyl-2′-deoxy-ADPR (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) have been shown to po-<lb/>tently inhibit TRPM2 current (IC 50 = 3 μm) without interfering<lb/> Ca 2+ release induced by cADPR, NAADP or IP 3 . <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref> Despite<lb/> the efforts in searching for TRPM2 inhibitors, no TRP-subtype<lb/> selective TRPM2 inhibitor has yet been identified. Therefore, it<lb/> is critical to discover novel selective inhibitors of TRPM2 that<lb/> can be used to further investigate TRPM2 channel function and<lb/> validate the channel as a therapeutic target.<lb/></p>

			<p>Substitution of pyrophosphate linkage oxygen of ADPR<lb/> has rarely been investigated. Xu et al. <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref> introduced a meth-<lb/>ylenebisphosphonate linkage to cADPR and found that the<lb/> activity of cADPR is very sensitive to the modifications in the<lb/> pyrophosphate moiety, indicating that pyrophosphate moiety<lb/> contributes to cADPR binding on its receptor. Considering the<lb/> homology of cADPR and ADPR, we, in this study, synthe-<lb/>sized a new series of ADPR analogues (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) by integrat-<lb/>ing the modifications of pyrophosphate linkage and adenosine,<lb/> in which the pyrophosphate linkage was replaced by meth-<lb/>ylenebisphosphate or difluoromethylenebisphosphate. The<lb/> activity of all synthesized individual ADPR analogues was<lb/> assessed. Their selectivity against other TRP channels includ-<lb/>ing TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1 and TRPV3 was also evaluated.<lb/> Two novel TRPM2 inhibitors, 7i and 8a, were identified in<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 | Chemistry<lb/></head>

			<p>All commercial chemicals and solvents were purchased from<lb/> commercial suppliers of analytical grade and used without<lb/> further purification. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded<lb/> on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts<lb/> were reported as values from an internal tetramethylsilane<lb/> standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were re-<lb/>corded on a Bruker Apex IV FTMS. LC/MS analyses were<lb/> performed on an Agilent 1200-6110 instruments. Silica<lb/> gel (200~300 mesh) was used for chromatography. HPLC<lb/> (Gilson, France) was used to purify the protected and the<lb/> final deprotected ADPR analogues, whereby a C18 reversed-<lb/>phase column (Venusil XBP C18-2, 21.5 mm×250 mm,<lb/> 10 μm, Agela Technologies, Beijing, China) was employed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Generally, the synthesis of ADPR analogues could be di-<lb/>vided into two routes (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). One was adenosine diphosphate<lb/> (ADP) coupled with 5-tosyl ribose (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), in which ADP ana-<lb/>logues were originally synthesized from C-2 position substituted<lb/> adenosines and 5-tosyl ribose was originally synthesized from<lb/> D-ribose. The other one was 5′-tosyl nucleoside coupled with ri-<lb/>bose diphosphate (RDP) (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), in which 5-tosyl adenosines<lb/> were originally synthesized from C-2 position substituted ade-<lb/>nosine and RDP analogues were originally synthesized from D-<lb/>ribose. Protected ADPR analogues were synthesized employing<lb/> above synthetic route and were further deprotected with aqueous<lb/> HCl and purified by HPLC to give the final ADPR analogues.<lb/> Detailed characterization data by 1 H, 13 C NMR, MS and HRMS<lb/> for all compounds are available in Supporting information.<lb/></p>

			<p>The tetracycline-inducible HEK293 cells stably expressing<lb/> the human TRPM2, <ref type="biblio">[32,33]</ref> after being induced with 1 μg/ml tet-<lb/>racycline for 12~36 hr, were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO 2<lb/> in DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, USA) containing 10% foe-<lb/>tal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml<lb/> streptomycin. Human TRPM7 (NCBI Reference Sequence:<lb/> NM_001301212.1, in pcDNA5/TO vector), TRPM8 (NCBI<lb/> Reference Sequence: NM_024080.4, in pcDNA4/TO vec-<lb/>tor), TRPV1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_080704.3, in<lb/> pcDNA4/TO vector) and TRPV3 (NCBI Reference Sequence:<lb/> NM_001258205.1, in pcMV6/TO vector) were transfected into<lb/> HEK-293 T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 for 24~48 hr be-<lb/>fore recordings. HEK293 T cells were cultured at 37°C under<lb/> 5% CO 2 in DMEM medium (Gibco, USA) containing 10%<lb/> foetal calf serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/<lb/> ml streptomycin.

			<head>2.2.2 | Western blot<lb/></head>

			<p>Western blot was conducted as previously described. <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref> In brief,<lb/> after transfection for 24-36 hr, HEK293 cells were rinsed with<lb/> ice-cold PBS and lysed in ice-cold protein lysis buffer (RIPA<lb/> buffer, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) for 30 min.<lb/> After centrifuging the lysates at 20,817 g at 4°C for 10 min, the<lb/> supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C until use. The<lb/> protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein<lb/> assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). Thirty<lb/> to fifty micrograms of protein/lane was diluted in standard SDS<lb/> sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-<lb/>polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to polyvi-<lb/>nylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, USA), blocked with<lb/> 5% BSA (Sangon Biotech, China) in Tris-buffered saline con-<lb/>taining 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 2 hr at room temperature<lb/> and incubated with the primary antibody (TRPM2: Ab11168,<lb/> Abcam, UK) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then<lb/> washed with TBST and incubated with the secondary antibody<lb/> (goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP: 31420, Thermo Fisher Scientific,<lb/> USA). Protein bands were visualized using an Odyssey Infrared<lb/> Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, USA). Quantity One soft-<lb/>ware (BioRad, USA) was used for densitometric scanning.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.3 | Electrophysiology<lb/></head>

			<p>Patch-clamp recordings were performed in whole-cell con-<lb/>figuration at room temperature using Axonpatch 200B (Axon,<lb/> USA) or HEKA EPC10 (HEKA, Germany) amplifier. Similar<lb/> to our previously reported protocol, <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref> cells were kept in extra-<lb/>cellular solution (ECS) containing (in mm): 147 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1<lb/> MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES and 13 glucose, pH 7.4. Electrodes<lb/> had a final resistance of 3-5 MΩ when filled with intracellu-<lb/>lar solution (ICS) containing (in mm): 147 NaCl, 0.05 EGTA,<lb/> 1 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES and 0.1 ADPR, pH 7.3. Patch pipettes<lb/> (2-4 MΩ) were prepared from the Narishige PC-10 puller<lb/> (Narishige, Japan) with Borosilicate glass (Sutter, USA).<lb/></p>

			<p>Test compound was added to either ECS or ICS with a<lb/> concentration of 0.1 mm, to determine the extracellular or in-<lb/>tracellular effect of test compound on TRPM2. The ADPR<lb/> concentration was fixed at 0.1 mm in the ICS that also con-<lb/>tains test compound when tested for intracellular effect. ECS<lb/> with compound was perfused for at least 60 s before switch-<lb/>ing to acidic ECS (pH 5.0) that blocks TRPM2 current.<lb/></p>

			<p>Change of extracellular solution was achieved using an<lb/> RSC-160 system (Biologic Science Instruments, France) in<lb/> which the solution changing time was about 300 ms. Cell<lb/> was held at 0 mV. Voltage ramps with 500 ms duration from<lb/> -100 to 100 mV were applied every 5 s. Data were acquired<lb/> at 10 kHz and filtered offline at 50 Hz. Capacitive currents<lb/> and series resistance were determined and corrected before<lb/> each voltage ramp. For analysis, the mean of the first three<lb/> ramps before channel activation was used for leak-subtraction<lb/> of all subsequent current recordings.<lb/></p>

			<p>For selectivity evaluation, test compound (0.1 mm) was<lb/> added to the intracellular solution (ICS) to determine intra-<lb/>cellular effect of compound on individual TRPM7, TRPM8,<lb/> TRPV1 and TRPV3, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>For recordings of TRPM7 channels, the extracellular solution<lb/> (ECS) contains (in mm): 145 NaCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 5 KCl, 10<lb/> D-glucose, 10 HEPES. The ICS contains (in mm): 135 CsCl, 10<lb/> EGTA, 10 HEPES and 4 CaCl 2 ; pH was adjusted to 7.2 with<lb/> CsOH, osmolarity was adjusted to ~305 mOsm with mannitol.<lb/> Low concentrations of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ (both in 0.1 mm) were<lb/> used to activate TRPM7, and high concentrations of Ca 2+ and<lb/> Mg 2+ (2 mm Ca 2+ and 1 mm Mg 2+ ) were used to inhibit TRPM7.<lb/></p>

			<p>For recordings of TRPM8 and TRPV1, the ECS contains (in<lb/> mm): 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 D-glucose, 10 HEPES, 1.2 MgCl 2<lb/> and 1.5 CaCl 2 ; pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The ICS con-<lb/>tains (in mm): 115 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 2 MgCl 2 , 10 HEPES and 5.7<lb/> CaCl 2 , pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH, osmolarity was ad-<lb/>justed to ~290 mOsm with mannitol, and the calculated free Ca 2+<lb/> was 200 nm. Menthol (1 mm) was added in the ECS to activate<lb/> TRPM8, and 2-APB (0.1 mm) was added in the ECS to inhibit<lb/> TRPM8. Capsaicin (0.01 mm) and ruthenium red (0.1 mm) were<lb/> added in the ECS to activate and inhibit TRPV1, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>For TRPV3 recordings, both ECS and ICS contained<lb/> 130 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA. 0.1 mm 2-APB in the ECS was<lb/> used to activate TRPV3 and was washed out with standard ECS.<lb/></p>

			<head>3 | RESULTS<lb/> </head>
				
			<head>3.1 | Chemistry<lb/></head>

			<p>All the ADPR analogues (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) were synthe-<lb/>sized in two simple routes (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>; Schemes <ref type="figure">1-3</ref>). ADP<lb/> analogues and RDP analogues were key intermediates for<lb/> the synthesis of protected ADPR analogues. The protected<lb/> ADPR analogues were deprotected with aqueous HCl to give<lb/> final ADPR analogues.<lb/></p>

			<p>In route 1, C-2 and C-6 position substituted adenos-<lb/>ines were treated with acetone in acidic solution, then re-<lb/>acted with tosyl chloride to give 2′,3′-O-isopropylidene-5<lb/> ′-O-tosyl adenosines 2a~2h in moderate yield (45%~80%)<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Compounds 2a~2h were phosphorylated with<lb/> corresponding tris(tetra-n-butylammonium) hydrogen pyro-<lb/>phosphate to give ADP analogues 3a~3l in moderate yield<lb/> (50%~70%). Compounds 3a~3l were esterified with 1-O-m<lb/> ethyl-2,3-O-isopropylidene-5-O-tosyl ribose 5 to give pro-<lb/>tected ADPR analogues 7a~7l. Finally, the protected ADPR<lb/> analogues were deprotected with 0.8 N aqueous HCl and<lb/> purified by HPLC to give ADPR analogues 8a~8c, 10a~10l.<lb/></p>

			<p>Applying route 1 gave compound 7c in low yield (yield<lb/> &lt;10%). Thus, route 2 was designed (Scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref>), in which<lb/> 1-O-methyl-2,3-O-isopropylidene-5-O-tosyl ribose 5 instead<lb/> of 2′,3′-O-isopropylidene-5′-O-tosyl adenosine was phos-<lb/>phorylated with corresponding tris(tetra-n-butylammonium)<lb/> </p>

In Moreau&apos;s re-<lb/>port, <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref> ADPR analogues are synthesized using NADase as an<lb/> important catalyst, and quite a number of individual synthetic<lb/> routes were applied. Taken together, in this study, a more ef-<lb/>ficient way for synthesis of ADPR analogues was developed.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 | Intracellular, but not extracellular,<lb/> inhibition of TRPM2 by two novel ADPR<lb/> analogues 7i and 8a<lb/></head>

			<p>To screen for TRPM2 inhibitors, the effects of all synthe-<lb/>sized ADPR analogues (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) were evaluated on TRPM2<lb/> channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells by whole-cell<lb/> patch-clamp recordings. In HEK293 cells, the expression of<lb/> TRPM2 channel proteins was detected by Western blot anal-<lb/>ysis (Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref>). It is known that TRPM2 is only activated<lb/> by intracellular ADPR that binds directly to TRPM2 chan-<lb/>nel&apos;s enzymatic NUDT9-H domain in the C-terminal tail. <ref type="biblio">[6]<lb/></ref> We tested whether extracellular administration of individual<lb/> ADPR analogues had any effect on TRPM2 currents (Table<lb/> <ref type="table">S1</ref>). When administered extracellularly (100 μm), none of<lb/> the synthesized ADPR analogues showed any inhibition on<lb/> TRPM2 currents induced by intracellular ADPR, in which<lb/> compounds 7i and 8a serving as representatives (Figure <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).<lb/> In contrast, intracellular administration of 7i or 8a at 3 μm<lb/> resulted in a reduction of TRPM2 current by 39% and 36%,<lb/> respectively, as compared with 100 μm ADPR as a control<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">4c-e</ref>, p &lt; .005). Applying different concentrations of<lb/> 7i or 8a gave rise to a dose-dependent inhibition of TRPM2<lb/> current with IC 50 s for 7i at 5.7 μm and 8a at 5.4 μm (Figure <ref type="figure">4f</ref>).<lb/> These results suggest compounds 7i and 8a inhibited TRPM2<lb/> intracellularly, possibly through competing with ADPR by<lb/> binding to the intracellular NUDT9-H domain.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3 | Lack of inhibitory effect on other TRP<lb/> channels by compound 7i or 8a<lb/></head>

			<p>To evaluate the compounds selectivity, the effects of both<lb/> 7i and 8a on other TRP channels, including the closely re-<lb/>lated channels TRPM7 and TRPM8, and the more distantly<lb/> related channels TRPV1 and TRPV3, were tested. TRPM7<lb/> currents overexpressed in HEK293T cells were activated by<lb/> low concentrations of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ (both in 0.1 mm) in<lb/> the extracellular solution (ECS). Compared with the control<lb/> without 7i (Figure <ref type="figure">5k</ref>), the intracellular administration of 7i<lb/> (100 μm) showed no effect on TRPM7 currents (Figure <ref type="figure">5a</ref>).<lb/> Similarly, adding 100 μm 7i compound in the pipette did not<lb/> affect TRPM8 pharmacology in response to either activator,<lb/> menthol (1 mm) or blocker 2-APB (100 μm) (Figure <ref type="figure">5b,l</ref>).<lb/> Adding compound 7i (100 μm) in the pipette had no effect on<lb/> activating TRPV1 induced by capsaicin, although appeared<lb/> to delay the channel activation (Figure <ref type="figure">5c,m</ref>). The intracel-<lb/>lular effect of compound 7i on TRPV3 was also tested. As<lb/> shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5d</ref>,n, application of compound 7i (100 μm) in<lb/> pipette had no effect on TRPV3 currents activated by 100 μm<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, the effects of compound 8a on TRPM7, TRPM8,<lb/> TRPV1 and TRPV3 were also tested. Intracellular administra-<lb/>tions of compound 8a (100 μm) did not show any inhibitory ef-<lb/>fect on these TRP channels (Figure <ref type="figure">5f-j,k-n</ref>). Taken together,<lb/> these results indicate that compounds 7i and 8a are specific in in-<lb/>hibiting TRPM2 channel without affecting other TRP channels.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4 | Structure-activity relationship<lb/> (SAR) of synthesized ADPR analogues for<lb/> TRPM2 inhibition<lb/></head>

			<p>Totally, 39 compounds were synthesized to explore the structure-<lb/>activity relationship (SAR) of the ADPR analogues (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).<lb/> To begin with adenosine modification, ADPR analogues (7h,<lb/> 7g, 10h, 10g) with 6-methylamino or 6-dimethylamino substi-<lb/>tution showed no inhibitory activity, indicating the necessity<lb/> of 6-amino for inhibitory activity. This is in accordance with<lb/> Moreau&apos;s report, in which 6-oxygen substituted ADPR (IDPR)<lb/> shows no inhibitory activity. <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref> Substitutions at C-2 position<lb/> of purine base showed different influences. Compounds 7i<lb/> (2-chloro) and 8a (2-hydrogen) exhibited moderate activity,<lb/> while other substitutions such as 2-bromo, 2-iodo, 2-amino and<lb/> 2-methoxy (7a~7e, 7h, 7j~7o, 10a~10o) did not. Thus, more<lb/> kinds of substitutions should be investigated to further reveal the<lb/> effect of C-2 position modification on inhibitory activity, which<lb/> may lead to novel potent inhibitors. As to adenosine ribose part,<lb/> neither compound 13 nor compound 14 with 2′-methoxy substi-<lb/>tution showed any inhibitory activity indicating the importance<lb/> of C-2′ position for analogues binding.<lb/></p>

			<p>With regard to pyrophosphate, both two active com-<lb/>pounds 7i and 8a possess a substituted pyrophosphate<lb/> (O → CH 2 or CF 2 ). In contrast, inactive compound 7o re-<lb/>serves oxygen-linked pyrophosphate. Previous report consid-<lb/>ered pyrophosphate as an activity-keeping group and none<lb/> of the sulphonamide, squarate or triazole substituted ADPR<lb/> analogues showed any activity. <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref> Therefore, appropriate<lb/> modifications on the pyrophosphate can be tolerable.<lb/></p>

			<p>As to the terminal ribose, it has been shown that a five-<lb/>membered ring but the hydroxyl groups of the terminal ribose<lb/> plays a critical role in filling the binding site. <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref> Here, compounds<lb/> 7i and 8a (both terminal ribose hydroxyl protected) showed in-<lb/>hibitory activity, while their corresponding deprotected products<lb/> 10i and 10a lost inhibitory activity. Taken together, we suppose,<lb/> applying saturated ring mimicking essential terminal ribose is<lb/> feasible, which may improve the inhibitory activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>4 | DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>Searching for selective TRPM2 inhibitors as tool molecules is<lb/> critical for probing pharmacological functions of the channel.<lb/> Up to date, there are non-specific TRPM2 inhibitors such as<lb/> 2-APB, clotrimazole and FFA. These inhibitors exhibit low<lb/> potency on TRPM2 channel and also are lack of selectivity<lb/> on other TRP channels. Moreau et al. previously reported<lb/> several ADPR analogues as specific TRPM2 inhibitors with-<lb/>out interfering Ca 2+ release induced by cADPR, NAADP or<lb/> IP 3 . <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref> However, the selectivity of these analogues against<lb/> other TRP channels remains unclear.<lb/></p>

			<p>To discover novel TRPM2 selective inhibitors, we sys-<lb/>tematically synthesized a new series of ADPR analogues<lb/> (Schemes <ref type="figure">1-3</ref>) in this study. Modifications were mainly fo-<lb/>cused on pyrophosphate linkage and adenosine, to improve<lb/> the potency and membrane permeability. Two major routes<lb/> were employed for ADPR analogue synthesis (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/> Both synthetic routes are relative simple, of which ADP<lb/> analogues and RDP analogues were the key intermediates<lb/> (Schemes <ref type="figure">1-3</ref>). These two key intermediates were obtained<lb/> in moderate yield (50%~70%) and can be employed for ADPR<lb/> analogues derivatization easily. Compared with previous re-<lb/>port of which ADPR analogues are synthesized through quite<lb/> a number of individual synthetic routes, <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref> a more efficient<lb/> way for synthesis of ADPR analogues was developed in this<lb/> </p>

			<p>study, though esterification and deprotection steps give the<lb/> desired products (protected ADPR analogues and ADPR an-<lb/>alogues) in low yield.<lb/></p>

			<p>Totally 39 new ADPR analogues were synthesized.<lb/> Compounds 7i and 8a were confirmed as TRPM2 inhibi-<lb/>tors with moderate activity, exerting intracellular inhibition<lb/> of TRPM2 current, and demonstrating selectivity over other<lb/> TRP members including TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1 and<lb/> TRPV3. The characters of these two inhibitors probably at-<lb/>tribute to the nature of ADPR analogues. It is well known<lb/> that ADPR gates TRPM2 through binding to the cytosolic<lb/> C-terminal NUDT9-H domain which is a unique structure<lb/> domain among TRP channels. <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref> The two inhibitors 7i and<lb/> 8a likely compete with ADPR for binding to the NUDT9-H<lb/> domain, serving as intracellular inhibitors. These two new in-<lb/>hibitors are firstly identified TRP-subtype selective TRPM2<lb/> inhibitors, which are selective over TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1<lb/> and TRPV3, providing new tool molecules for probing phar-<lb/>macological functions of TRPM2 channel. Previous reported<lb/> nonselective inhibitors such as FFA and 2-APB also show<lb/> significant effects on other ion channels. FFA can also inhibit<lb/> TRPM3, TRPM4 and TRPM5, <ref type="biblio">[35,36]</ref> while 2-APB also acti-<lb/>vates TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPV3. <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref> When employing se-<lb/>lective inhibitors 7i or 8a on probing TRPM2 function, these<lb/> unwanted side-effects will be eliminated, so that the results<lb/> will be more relevant to TRPM2 channel. Though the two<lb/> inhibitors still exhibit poor membrane permeability limiting<lb/> their extracellular application in probing TRPM2 function,<lb/> applying liposomes or nucleotide prodrug technique will<lb/> allow the transport of 7i or 8a across the membrane. These<lb/> newly identified TRP-subtype selective inhibitors can serve<lb/> as new pharmacological tools for probing TRPM2 channel.<lb/></p>

			<p>What is more, the identification of ADPR-analogue-<lb/>based TRPM2 inhibitors provides further insights into<lb/> optimizing potency and membrane permeability. With<lb/> regarding to improving membrane permeability, none of<lb/> the ADPR analogues show any inhibitory activity when<lb/> administered extracellularly; thus, it is still insufficient<lb/> though substituting pyrophosphate oxygen with methylene<lb/> or difluoromethylene. Recently, a neutral triazole substi-<lb/>tuted cADPR (P 2 O 6<lb/> -→ triazole) that retains its ability to<lb/> activate Ca 2+ release was reported by Swarbrick et al. <ref type="biblio">[37]<lb/></ref> This encourages employing more kinds of neutral substi-<lb/>tutes, though the pyrophosphate group seems critical for<lb/> keeping the activity. For potency optimizing, more kinds of<lb/> substitutions at C-2 position should be investigated, which<lb/> may lead to novel potent inhibitors. Other successful cases<lb/> that took purine C-2 position substitution support this<lb/> hypothesis. Fischer et al. reported 2-chloro-adenosine-5′-<lb/>O-α-boranodiphosphate (2-Cl-α-BH 3 -ADP) as a potent ag-<lb/>onist (EC 50 = 7 nm) of P2Y1 receptor, whose endogenous<lb/> substrate is adenosine diphosphate (ADP). <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref> Similarly,<lb/> 2-methylthio-AMP was reported as an inhibitor of P2Y12<lb/> receptor, for which ADP serves as the endogenous sub-<lb/>strate as well. <ref type="biblio">[39,40]</ref> As far as to terminal ribose, neither<lb/> ribose nor isopropylidene-protected ribose determines the<lb/> inhibitory activity, thus employing more kinds of rings is<lb/> an alternative way.<lb/></p>

			<head>5 | CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>Searching for selective TRPM2 inhibitors as tool molecules<lb/> is critical for probing pharmacological functions of the chan-<lb/>nel. In this study, we synthesized 39 new ADPR analogues, of<lb/> which the modifications were mainly focused on pyrophos-<lb/>phate linkage and adenosine. Their effects on TRPM2 chan-<lb/>nel were evaluated. Compounds 7i and 8a were confirmed as<lb/> TRPM2 inhibitors with moderate activity, exerting intracellu-<lb/>lar inhibition of TRPM2 current, and demonstrating selectivity<lb/> over other TRP members including TRPM7, TRPM8, TRPV1<lb/> and TRPV3. Besides, a more sufficient SAR of ADPR-<lb/>analogue TRPM2 inhibitors was summarized in this study.<lb/> In summary, we synthesized and obtained two novel<lb/> subtype selective TRPM2 inhibitors. The newly identified<lb/> TRPM2 inhibitors can serve as new pharmacological tools for<lb/> further investigation and validation of TRPM2 channel as a<lb/> drug target. The summarized SAR may also provide insights<lb/> into further improving existing inhibitors as potential lead<lb/> compounds.</p>
