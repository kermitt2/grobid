			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Numerous dietary studies have stressed the importance of vitamin A for proper functioning of the<lb/> immune system as vitamin A insufficiency is correlated to multiple infectious diseases <ref type="biblio">(1-3)</ref>.<lb/> Vitamin A, also known as retinol, needs to be metabolized into its active form retinoic acid (RA) to<lb/> influence the immune system. Retinol is an essential fat-soluble molecule, which needs to be<lb/> obtained via the diet. Dietary retinoids are absorbed by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and<lb/> transported in chylomicrons, in the form of retinyl esters, via the lymphatic system and can be<lb/> stored in the liver from where it can be transported to target cells <ref type="biblio">(4)</ref>. Vitamin A is converted into<lb/> the metabolic active product RA within the IEC <ref type="biblio">(5)</ref>. First, retinol<lb/> is converted into retinal under normal physiological conditions<lb/> by microsomal retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) in a reversible<lb/> mechanism <ref type="biblio">(6)</ref>. Second, retinal is irreversibly converted by<lb/> aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) to form RA <ref type="biblio">(7)</ref>. RA binds<lb/> to nuclear receptors to regulate target gene expression.<lb/></p>

			<p>Metabolized vitamin A has an extensive influence on the<lb/> immune system. For instance, metabolism of vitamin A by<lb/> epithelial cells is responsible for steering mucosal dendritic<lb/> cells (DCs) towards CD103-expressing tolerogenic cells, which<lb/> in turn gain ALDH enzyme activity to produce RA themselves<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(8-11)</ref>. Moreover, metabolized vitamin A induces expression of<lb/> gut homing molecules <ref type="biblio">(11, 12)</ref>, differentiation of T and B cells<lb/> and antibody class switching <ref type="biblio">(13-17)</ref>. More specifically, mouse<lb/> strains with lower ALDH enzyme activity secrete less<lb/> immunoglobulin A (IgA) into the intestinal lumen, leading to<lb/> higher levels of bacterial translocation into the intestinal lamina<lb/> propria and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), compared to mice<lb/> with high ALDH enzyme activity <ref type="biblio">(18)</ref>. While RA was shown to<lb/> directly promote IgA class switching <ref type="biblio">(17, 19)</ref>, the lack of RA<lb/> signalling in B cells abrogated antigen specific IgA responses<lb/> after oral immunization and affected the microbial composition<lb/> of the intestine <ref type="biblio">(17)</ref>. The source of RA for lymphocytes in<lb/> intestinal tissues is not completely known, as dendritic cells<lb/> (DCs), stromal cells, as well as epithelial cells have all been<lb/> indicated as cells that express vitamin A converting enzymes <ref type="biblio">(10,<lb/> 20, 21)</ref>. It is becoming clear that in mice mucosal DCs play a<lb/> critical role in the vitamin A mediated effects for the immune<lb/> system, thereby regulating mucosal adaptive immune responses<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(22)</ref>. Murine experiments have demonstrated that DCs<lb/> metabolize RA and skew B cell differentiation into IgA+ B cells<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(11, 18, 23)</ref>. However, studies assessing the mechanistic<lb/> contribution of dendritic cells to vitamin A metabolism and B<lb/> cell functionality are exclusive to murine studies. Human studies<lb/> have mainly demonstrated that human DCs can induce IL10-<lb/>producing regulatory T cells <ref type="biblio">(23-25)</ref> and induce the expression<lb/> of gut homing receptor a4b7 <ref type="biblio">(23, 26)</ref> in an RA-<lb/>dependent mechanism.<lb/></p>

			<p>To date, the uptake and metabolism of vitamin A within<lb/> human immune cells has remained largely elusive. Partly because<lb/> retinoids are small, lipophilic molecules which are difficult to<lb/> detect via microscopy methods. Previously, we developed an<lb/> activity-based probe with alkyne click handle to visualize and<lb/> quantify ALDH activity <ref type="biblio">(27)</ref>. In line, we now designed,<lb/> synthesized and applied novel bio-orthogonal retinoid-based<lb/> probes (clickable probes), which were structurally and<lb/> functionally, virtually indistinguishable from vitamin A. Yet<lb/> they contain a functional group (an alkyne) to conjugate them<lb/> to a fluorogenic dye to monitor retinoid molecules in real-time in<lb/> immune cells, enabling their visualization by flow cytometry and<lb/> microscopy. These clickable probes showed to be functionally<lb/> comparable to their natural counterpart. The contribution of RA<lb/> derived from dendritic cells to B cell functionality in humans has<lb/> not been yet addressed. Using these probes we show that human<lb/> B lymphocytes lack the machinery to metabolize retinol into RA,<lb/> although they can internalize retinoids. Interestingly, exogenous<lb/> RA directly CD38 expression on B cells. In contrast, human<lb/> monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) have the machinery<lb/> to metabolize retinol into RA. We observed that retinal, when<lb/> metabolized by moDCs, led to increased CD38 expression on B<lb/> cells, suggesting that human dendritic cells can influence B<lb/> lymphocytes directly by the production of RA. Overall, this<lb/> study shows that human dendritic cells can serve as a source of<lb/> RA for B cells and that this influences B cell properties.<lb/></p>

			<head>Synthesis of Clickable Retinoid Analogues<lb/></head>

			<p>The clickable retinoid analogues were synthesized using the<lb/> convergent synthesis route. Wittig salt (1 in scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>) was<lb/> coupled with aldehyde (2 in scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>) to make the protected<lb/> retinal analogue RE-click in 8% yield. Aldehyde (2 in scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>)<lb/> was synthesized following a literature procedure, which can be<lb/> found in scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref> <ref type="biblio">(28)</ref>. The poor yield is a result of several<lb/> purification steps, which were required to separate the product<lb/> from the unreacted aldehyde 2 and the facile deprotection of the<lb/> acetal group under acidic conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Retinal analogue RE-click was stored in ethanol at -80°C with<lb/> the aldehyde still protected as dimethyl acetal. Exposure to<lb/> slightly acidic conditions using a buffer or MilliQ instantly<lb/> liberates the aldehyde, after which the compound can be used.<lb/> The retinoic acid analogue was made using commercially<lb/> available aldehyde (3 in scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>), which resulted in<lb/> compound 4 (4 in scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>) with a yield of 39%. This was<lb/> then converted into the clickable retinoic acid analogue RA-click<lb/> using 2M NaOH with a 24% yield, which was stored under the<lb/> same conditions as the aldehyde analogue RE-click.<lb/></p>

			<p>All reactions were performed using oven or flame-dried<lb/> glassware and dry solvents. Reagents were purchased from Sigma<lb/> Aldrich, Acros, Biosolve, VWR, Fluka, Fischer Scientific and Merck<lb/> and used as received unless stated otherwise. Tetrahydrofuran<lb/> (THF) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were stored over<lb/> molecular sieves before use. All moisture sensitive reactions were<lb/> performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. TLC analysis was<lb/> performed using Merck aluminum sheets (TLC silica gel 60/<lb/> Kieselguhr F 254 . Compounds were visualized using a solution of<lb/> KMnO 4 (7.5 g), K 2 CO 3 (50 g), 10% NaOH (6 mL) in H 2 O (1L).<lb/> Column chromatography was performed using Screening Device<lb/> B.V. silica gel (particle size of 40 -63 µm, pore diameter of 60 Å)<lb/> with the indicated eluents. 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra were recorded<lb/> on Brüker AV-400 (400 MHz and 101 MHz, respectively) or Brüker<lb/> AV-500 MHz (500 MHz and 150 MHz, respectively) using CDCl 3<lb/> as solvent. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm (d) relative to the<lb/> residual solvent peak or tetramethylsilane. Coupling constants are<lb/> given in Hz. High-resolution mass spectometry (HRMS) analysis<lb/> was performed with a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo<lb/> Finnigan), equipped with an electronspray ion source in positive<lb/> mode (source voltage 3.5 kV, sheath gas flow 10 mL/min, capillary<lb/> temperature 250°C) with resolution R = 60000 at m/z 400 (mass<lb/> range m/z = 150 -2000) and dioctyl phthalate (m/z = 391.28428) as<lb/> a &quot;lock mass&quot;, or with a Synapt G2-Si (Waters), equipped with an<lb/> electronspray ion source in positive mode (ESI-TOF), injection via<lb/> NanoEquity system (Waters), with LeuEnk (m/z = 556.2771) as<lb/> &quot;lock mass&quot;. Eluents used: MeCN:H 2 O (1:1 v/v) supplemented with<lb/> 0.1% formic acid. The high-resolution mass spectrometers were<lb/> calibrated prior to measurements with a calibration mixture<lb/> (Thermo Finnigan). The retinoids were handled under dark<lb/> conditions using amber colored flasks or aluminum foil when<lb/> containing more than 3 conjugated double bonds. Retinoid<lb/> intermediates were stored in the dark under nitrogen at -30°C<lb/> and final compounds as powder or as EtOH stock at -80°C under<lb/> nitrogen atmosphere. For further information on retinoid handling<lb/> and storage we refer to the review from Barua and Furr <ref type="biblio">(29)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Incubation of Cells With Clicklable<lb/> Retionoids and Click Chemistry<lb/></head>

			<p>In all experiments, cells were incubated with 1 µM clickable<lb/> retinoids for 1 hour at 37°C in RPMI medium, without serum,<lb/> unless otherwise indicated. Cells were fixed using 1% PFA for 30<lb/> minutes on ice. 5 µl (100 mM) CuSO4 and 5 µl (1 M) NaAsc<lb/> (both Sigma Aldrich) we mixed and vortexed for a few minutes<lb/> until the colour turned from brown to yellow. 2,5 µl THPTA (100<lb/> mM) (Sigma Aldrich) was added to this mixture, together with<lb/> 487.5 µl PBS. After a few minutes, 0,5 µl commercially available<lb/> azide labelled with alexa fluor 647/488 (ClickChemistryTools)<lb/> was added and incubated for 3 additional minutes. This is called<lb/> the &apos;click mixture&apos; and is used for incubation with target cells, in<lb/> order to visualize clickable retinoids. The azide and alkyne form a<lb/> triazole, via a copper(I)-catalyzed [2 + 3] cyclo-addition. The<lb/> interaction between the azide group and alkyne is covalent,<lb/> resulting in a stable product. Once the interaction is formed<lb/> with the retinoid probe, the fluorophore cannot leave anymore.<lb/> Per click condition, around 100 000 cells were treated with 100 ul<lb/> click mixture for 1 hour at 37°C. Subsequently, cells were washed<lb/> with 2 mM EDTA, 3% BSA and finally PBS using the centrifuge<lb/> at 1500 rpm at 4°C.<lb/></p>

			<head>Characterization of Clickable Retinoids<lb/> Within Human Dendritic Cells<lb/></head>

			<p>To study the cellular uptake of endogenous vitamin A metabolites,<lb/> clickable retinal (RE-click) and retinoic acid (RA-click) were<lb/> designed to resemble its natural counterparts, including an<lb/> additional alkyne ligation handle to conjugate them to a<lb/> fluorescent dye, via an azyde, to allow their detection in cells<lb/> using microscopy or flow cytometry (Figures <ref type="figure">1A, B</ref>). First, we<lb/> used all white blood cells to get an insight into the uptake of the RE-<lb/>and RA-clickable probes within peripheral immune subsets. Briefly,<lb/> cells were placed in RPMI without any further addition at 37°C for 1<lb/> hr and the probes were added to the medium to allow cellular<lb/> uptake. For detection of the probes within cells fluorescently tagged<lb/> azide was ligated to the alkyne group present on the probe via a<lb/> copper-catalysed reaction. Using flow cytometry, uptake of the<lb/> clickable probes in granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes was<lb/> assessed by gating on their differences in flow cytometric<lb/> characteristics for forward-and side-scatter (Supplemental<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). To determine background signal click chemistry was<lb/> performed on cells receiving vehicle instead of the clickable probes.<lb/> It was observed that lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes all<lb/> had the capacity to take up the probes, although to varying degrees<lb/> (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure">1B-G</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Vitamin A metabolism plays a prominent role in intestinal DCs.<lb/> Therefore, human DCs were used to assess the applicability of the<lb/> clickable retinoids. We first verified whether human monocyte-<lb/>derived dendritic cells (moDCs) showed ALDH activity as<lb/> measured with the aldefluor assay. This assay utilizes a fluorescent<lb/> substrate, which is converted by ALDH enzymes, leading to the<lb/> accumulation of fluorescent signal within the cells that express the<lb/> enzymes. The amount of fluorescent product is proportional to the<lb/> ALDH activity in the cells. As a negative control,<lb/> diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) reagent is used to inhibit<lb/> ALDH activity, which sets the threshold for background signal.<lb/> Human moDCs showed enhanced aldefluor activity ranging from 2<lb/> to 21% within donors compared to 0.6 ± 0.5% SD in DEAB control<lb/> samples (Figures <ref type="figure">1C, D</ref>). This suggests that moDCs have ALDH<lb/> enzyme activity, which varied per donor. The average fold increase<lb/> in aldefluor positivity compared to the DEAB control was twenty-<lb/>seven (Figure <ref type="figure">1E</ref>). Subsequently, MoDCs were incubated with the<lb/> clickable probes to assess whether they were capable of taking up<lb/> retinoids. We observed that all moDCs demonstrated enhanced<lb/> mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for the RE-click compared to the<lb/> vehicle treated negative control, resulting in two separate peaks<lb/> within the moDCs (Figures <ref type="figure">1F, G</ref>). The RA-click was taken up by<lb/> approximately half of the moDCs, as the other half of the cells were<lb/> negative for the probe (Figures <ref type="figure">1H, I</ref>). Next, we titrated the uptake<lb/> of our probes in concentrations ranging from 1-1000 nM during a 1<lb/> hr incubation at 37°C in RPMI to see at which dose they were still<lb/> detectable within cells using flow cytometry. We observed that RE-<lb/>click and RA-click could still be detected at concentrations ranging<lb/> from 100 to 1000 nM compared to vehicle control, while below 10<lb/> nM uptake was not observed above the vehicle control (Figure <ref type="figure">1J</ref>).<lb/> To subsequently visualize the spatial distribution of the probes<lb/> within the cells, moDCs were incubated with the clickable probes<lb/> for 1 hr at 37°C in RPMI and analysed using microscopy. In line<lb/> with flow cytometric data, enhanced MFI compared to vehicle was<lb/> seen after incubation with clickable retinoid probes (Supplemental<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The RE-click mainly accumulated outside the nucleus of<lb/> moDCs in the cytosol, whereas the RA-click was also detected<lb/> within the nucleus in a small fraction of the cells (Figure <ref type="figure">1J</ref>). Three<lb/> dimensional analysis was performed and demonstrated that both<lb/> retinoid probes crossed the cell membrane and were internalized<lb/> (Supplemental Videos 1 and 2). Taken together our data<lb/> demonstrates that the clickable probes are a helpful tool to study<lb/> retinoid uptake, demonstrating that human moDCs have the<lb/> capacity to internalize retinoids.<lb/></p>

			<head>Uptake of Clickable Retinoids in Human<lb/> Dendritic Cells Is Independent of Protein<lb/> and Temperature<lb/></head>

			<p>Since we demonstrated that the clickable retinoids can be used to<lb/> quantify cellular uptake within human moDCs, we utilized the<lb/> probes to study the mechanism of uptake into more detail. For<lb/> blood-borne transport retinol is bound to retinol binding<lb/> protein-4 (RBP4) <ref type="biblio">(31)</ref>. Target cells expressing receptors to<lb/> recognize this retinoid-protein complex can take up retinol,<lb/> thereby providing the cells with cytoplasmic retinol for<lb/> metabolism <ref type="biblio">(31)</ref>. Therefore, we questioned whether the uptake<lb/> of our probes requires carrier proteins. Hereto we incubated<lb/> moDCs with the RE-and RA-click in phosphate buffered saline<lb/> (PBS) without any further supplementation. Using flow<lb/> cytometry, we observed that moDCs showed enhanced MFI for<lb/> both the RE-and RA-click compared to the vehicle control<lb/> (Figures <ref type="figure">2A, B</ref>), suggesting that uptake can be achieved in the<lb/> absence of proteins. Moreover, multiple studies have proposed<lb/> that the uptake of free retinoids happens via passive diffusion<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(32-34)</ref>. To assess whether uptake of clickable retinoids is<lb/></p>

			<p>dependent on ATP-driven metabolism, we incubated moDCs<lb/> with our probes at 4°C. It was observed that both RE-and RA-<lb/>click were taken up by moDCs when incubated at 4°C<lb/> (Figures <ref type="figure">2C, D</ref>). Although this suggests that the uptake of<lb/> clickable probes is ATP-independent, we did observe that a<lb/> fraction of the moDCs had not taken up any clickable probe,<lb/> indicative of uptake by a subset of DCs(Figure <ref type="figure">2E</ref>). Taken<lb/> together, the clickable probes can be used in a straightforward<lb/> method to study the cellular uptake of retinoids in immune cells.<lb/></p>

			<head>Clickable Retinoic Acid Is Functionally<lb/> Active Within Human Dendritic Cells<lb/></head>

			<p>Subsequently, the functionality of RA-click on human DC<lb/> behaviour was examined. Others have demonstrates that RA<lb/> polarizes peripheral monocytes into CD103 + tolerogenic DCs<lb/> with high ALDH activity <ref type="biblio">(23, 26)</ref>. Similarly, we differentiated<lb/> monocytes for 7 days within the presence of RA-click. Retinal was<lb/> excluded in these assays, as it has no functional effect on moDC<lb/> differentiation. In the presence of natural RA, and likewise the RA-<lb/>click, ALDH activity increased in moDCs (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). Moreover,<lb/> the expression of CD103 increased compared to conventional<lb/> cultured moDCs after incubation with natural RA and also upon<lb/> incubation with RA-click (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). Together, our data<lb/> demonstrates that the RA-click can induce the differentiation of<lb/> moDC in a similar fashion as its natural counterpart, suggesting the<lb/> probe is also suitable for functional assays.<lb/></p>

			<head>Naïve B Cells Take Up Exogenous Retinoids<lb/> but Cannot Produce Retinoid Acid<lb/></head>

			<p>After validating the clickable probes within human DCs, we<lb/> assessed vitamin A uptake and functionality within the less well<lb/> studied B lymphocyte compartment. Although it is recognized that<lb/> RA-mediated processes in B cells are important for proper adaptive<lb/> immune responses, such as IgA class-switching <ref type="biblio">(14, 17, 19, 35, 36)<lb/></ref> and induction of CD38 <ref type="biblio">(37, 38)</ref>, the physiological mechanism<lb/> remains unclear. To address the effects of retinoids on human B<lb/> lymphocytes, we first used the aldefluor assay to test whether B<lb/> lymphocytes have the machinery to produce retinoic acid. Within<lb/> the total CD19 + B lymphocyte population present in peripheral<lb/> blood, a small proportion was positive for the aldefluor assay<lb/> compared to DEAB treated samples (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure">3A,<lb/> B</ref>). However, when only naïve B cells were analysed no differences<lb/> were observed in MFI between cell treated with vehicle or DEAB,<lb/> demonstrating that human naïve B cells from peripheral blood<lb/> cannot metabolize the aldefluor assay substrate. This result suggests<lb/> that naïve B cells lack ALDH activity (Figures <ref type="figure">4A, B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>A<lb/> B<lb/> D<lb/> E<lb/> C<lb/> FIGURE 2 | Uptake of dickable retinoids in human dendritic cells is independent of protein and temperature. Monocytes were isolated from blood and differentiated<lb/> into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) during 7 days of culture in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 from 3 different donors. Uptake of (A) RE-click and<lb/> (B) RA-dick compared to the vehicle control in differentiated moDCs after incubation in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for one hour at 37°c was determined by<lb/> flowcytometric analysis and expressed as mean fluorescent intensity (MFI). Uptake of (C) RE-click and (D) RA-click compared to the vehicle control in differentiated<lb/> moDCs after incubated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for one hour at 4°C was determined by flowcytometric analysis and expressed as MFI. (E) Representative<lb/> histogram of uptake of RE-(pink) and RA-click (blue) compared to the vehicle control (solid line) in moDCs at 4°C, as shown in (C, D) Data are presented as mean±<lb/> SD. Student&apos;s t test; *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Next, we addressed whether clickable retinoids could be made<lb/> visible in B cells present in total PBMC fractions. Hereto, we first<lb/> tested whether flow cytometry and click chemistry were<lb/> compatible. We observed that the cupper-mediated click<lb/> reaction influenced the forward and side scatter profile of<lb/> leukocytes (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>) as well as the intensity<lb/> of multiple fluorescently labelled antibodies (Supplemental<lb/> Figures <ref type="figure">3B-D</ref>). This disqualified the combination of flow<lb/> cytometry and click chemistry in one assay as a viable method<lb/> for proper analysis of immune subsets. Therefore, we decided to<lb/> first use magnetic bead isolation to obtain naïve B cells, followed<lb/> by probe incubation and the click reaction, in order to address<lb/> whether B lymphocytes can take up retinoid probes. The RE-<lb/>probe accumulated with high MFI within the cells compared to<lb/> the vehicle control, suggesting that naïve B cells efficiently took<lb/> up the probe (Figures <ref type="figure">4C, D</ref>). The RA-click was taken up as well,<lb/> however the MFI was lower when compared to RE-click.<lb/> Similarly, total CD19 + B cells, including naïve as well as<lb/> memory B cells, showed a higher MFI with RE-click when<lb/> compared to RA-click (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure">4C, D</ref>). Next,<lb/> we examined the intracellular location of the accumulated<lb/> retinoid probes. Hereto, naïve B cells were placed on<lb/> microscope slides upon probe incubation and analyzed<lb/> microscopically. Human naïve B cells treated with vehicle<lb/> control demonstrated low fluorescence intensity, whereas<lb/> incubation of the RE-and RA-click showed increased<lb/> fluorescent signal (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The RE-click<lb/> probe preferably located outside the nucleus (Figure <ref type="figure">4E</ref>). The<lb/> RA-click was distributed evenly in most naïve B cells, while some<lb/> cells showed also accumulation of RA-click inside the nucleus<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">4E</ref>). The number of cells with intra-nuclear probe<lb/> accumulation varied per donor. To examine whether the<lb/> probes were taken up by the cells, rather than non-specific<lb/> binding to the outer cell membrane, three dimensional analysis<lb/> was performed. Here, we found that both the RE-as the RA-click<lb/> were inside the cells, and had crossed the cell membrane<lb/> (Supplemental Videos 3 and 4).<lb/></p>

			<p>Next, biological functionality of the clickable probes was<lb/> tested within naïve B lymphocytes. Hereto we first addressed<lb/> whether culture of human naïve B cells with T cell dependent<lb/> stimuli including aIgM antibodies, aCD40 antibodies and<lb/> interleukin-4 with the natural form of retinal or RA for 7 days<lb/> could affect CD38 expression. We observed that natural RA<lb/> induced upregulation of CD38 on naïve B lymphocytes, while its<lb/> substrate retinal had no effect (Figure <ref type="figure">4F</ref>). In line, we observed<lb/> that both RA-click as well as natural RA induced CD38<lb/> expression on naïve B cell in a similar fashion (Figures <ref type="figure">4G, H</ref>).<lb/> For the induction of IgA on the cultured B cells in these<lb/> conditions we observed that both RA-click, as well as its natural<lb/> equivalent, increased the percentage and fluorescent intensity of<lb/> IgA on naïve B lymphocytes, however this was not significant<lb/> (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Taken together our data suggest that,<lb/> despite lacking ALDH activity, retinal and retinoic acid are taken<lb/> up by naïve B cells, and that RA induces CD38 expression in vitro.<lb/></p>

			<head>Monocyte-Derived Dendritic Cells Convert<lb/> Retinal Into Retinoic Acid, and Increase B<lb/> Cell CD38 Expression<lb/></head>

			<p>Since we observed that moDCs have the capacity to take up and<lb/> convert retinal into retinoic acid, we further addressed whether<lb/> dendritic cells can serve as a source of retinoic acid for naïve B cells<lb/> in vitro using the upregulation of CD38 as a read-out. To this end,<lb/> we set up a co-culture of naive B lymphocytes with moDCs and T<lb/> cell dependent stimuli including aIgM antibodies, aCD40<lb/> antibodies and interleukin-4 with for 9 days. These co-cultures<lb/> were carried out in Vitamin A deficient medium as regular FCS-<lb/>supplemented medium contains retinal, which allowed us to<lb/> analyse the effect of the addition of retinal in the absence or<lb/> presence of moDCs on B cells. As a positive control, RA was<lb/> supplemented to the moDC and B cell co-culture leading to<lb/> increased expression of CD38 (Figures <ref type="figure">5A, B</ref>). Addition of<lb/> retinal resulted in enhanced CD38 expression only when moDCs<lb/> and naïve B cells were cultured together and not when naïve B cells<lb/> were cultured alone(Figures <ref type="figure">5A, B</ref>). Overall, this data indicates that<lb/> human dendritic cells can convert retinal into retinoic acid, which<lb/> can be transferred to naïve B cells, leading to B cell differentiation.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>In this study, we designed clickable probes which closely<lb/> resemble the natural homologues, allowing analysis of the<lb/> retinoid uptake within human immune cells. A protocol was<lb/> established to study retinoid probes in a wide variety biological<lb/> analysis systems, including flow cytometry and microscopy. As a<lb/> result, we observed that multiple immune cell populations<lb/> including monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells and B<lb/> lymphocytes take up retinoids, to varying degrees of intensity,<lb/> indicating that these probes address cell specific uptake of<lb/> vitamin A metabolites by immune cells. Human dendritic cells<lb/> and B lymphocytes were both able to internalize the retinoid<lb/> analogues. Although dendritic cells have the machinery to<lb/> convert retinal into retinoic acid, our data shows that B<lb/></p>

			<p>lymphocytes do not express ALDH enzymes, which is in line<lb/> with earlier reports <ref type="biblio">(39)</ref>. Despite the incapability of B cells to<lb/> produce RA, IgA class switching by B lymphocytes is facilitated<lb/> by RA <ref type="biblio">(11, 35)</ref>. In addition to existing data, we now demonstrate<lb/> that human dendritic cells convert retinal and provide B<lb/> lymphocytes with retinoic acid resulting in the upregulation of<lb/> CD38 expression. This suggests that similar as has been shown<lb/> with mouse studies, also for human B lymphocytes RA steers<lb/> adaptive immune responses and that DCs can serve as an<lb/> exogenous source of RA to facilitate this process.<lb/> The visualization of lipid mediators at cellular levels has been<lb/> a challenge.

			<p>copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition to a variety of<lb/> lipid structures including fatty acids and cholesterols <ref type="biblio">(42-45)</ref>.<lb/> Previously, we developed an activity-based probe with alkyne<lb/> click handle to visualize and quantify ALDH activity <ref type="biblio">(27)</ref>. In line,<lb/> we now succeeded in chemically adjusting retinal and retinoid<lb/> acid, enabling their visualization in flow cytometry and<lb/> microscopy approaches and showing similar functionality<lb/> compared to their natural counterpart. Nevertheless, the<lb/> retinoid probes have two practical limitations, which we did<lb/> not further elaborate on during this study. We observed that<lb/> concentrations between 100 -1000 nM of retinoid probes in<lb/> moDCs result in significant uptake, while this was not obvious at<lb/> the concentration 1 -10 nM, during an incubation time of 1<lb/> hour. To quantify physiological relevant concentrations of our<lb/> probes, longer incubation times might be required. However,<lb/> upon longer incubation with the probes at 37°C, we observed<lb/> that the probes were metabolized as the fluorescence intensity<lb/> signal decreased when incubation time was extended. Yet, when<lb/> incubated at 4°C the uptake of the probes increased when cells<lb/> were incubated for 4 hours, compared to 1 hour. This is in line<lb/> with a report stating that therapeutically administered retinoic<lb/> acid is metabolized in patients in a period of 30-40 min (<ref type="formula">46</ref>).<lb/> Moreover, we experienced that the chemical clicking process of<lb/> the fluorescent label affected fluorescent intensity of some<lb/> commercially available antibodies, making it difficult to<lb/> combine retinoid visualization with additional markers. To<lb/> circumvent this, immune populations were isolated using<lb/> magnetic beads or flow cytometry sorting prior to the chemical<lb/> clicking method, to allow assessment of uptake within specific<lb/> subsets without using additional fluorescent antibodies.<lb/> However, copper-mediated click chemistry has been<lb/> successfully combined with immunofluorescence by others <ref type="biblio">(47,<lb/> 48)</ref>. One study demonstrated that specific fluorophores are<lb/> copper-resistant, such as td Tomato, allowing to combine<lb/> conventional staining with copper-mediated chemistry <ref type="biblio">(47)</ref>.<lb/> Consequently, additional studies are required to determine<lb/> which fluorescently labelled antibodies can withstand copper-<lb/>mediated chemistry to combine click-chemistry with flow<lb/> cytometry in future studies.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>It is uncertain whether retinoids passively diffuse into cells<lb/> because of their hydrophobic properties, or whether it is a process<lb/> that requires specific receptors or transporters. Transport of the<lb/> vitamin A derivative retinol in the periphery takes place when<lb/> coupled to serum transport proteins, such as retinol binding protein<lb/> 4 (RBP4) <ref type="biblio">(31)</ref>, and uptake is facilitated by a receptor expressed on<lb/> target cells <ref type="biblio">(31)</ref>. We questioned whether the uptake of our clickable<lb/> probes in moDCs, required any carrier proteins. However, we<lb/> observed that the probes were still efficiently internalized when<lb/> the incubations were performed with PBS buffer lacking any further<lb/> supplementation, meaning that the clickable retinoids had no access<lb/> to any transport proteins. This suggests that clickable probes were<lb/> not internalized via transport proteins. Moreover, it is also unlikely<lb/> that clickable retinoids entered immune cells in our experiments via<lb/> the retinoic acid 6 (STRA6) receptor, which has been described to be<lb/> involved in retinol uptake, as unbound retinoids cannot be<lb/> transported via STRA6 <ref type="biblio">(49, 50)</ref>. Others have proposed that<lb/> uptake of free retinoids is reliant on passive diffusion facilitated by<lb/> their size and hydrophobic properties <ref type="biblio">(32-34)</ref>. However, passive<lb/> diffusion would be an inconvenient mechanism as free retinoids are<lb/> highly toxic to cells <ref type="biblio">(51, 52)</ref>. Furthermore, we demonstrated that<lb/> both the RE-and RA-click probes can efficiently be taken up when<lb/> incubated on ice, suggesting that no active metabolism is required<lb/> for the internalization. Although it may not be an ATP-dependent<lb/> mechanism, we did observe that only half of the moDCS<lb/> internalized RA-click, suggesting that the uptake of retinoids is<lb/> not based purely on passive diffusion but rather on other<lb/></p>

			<figure>A<lb/> B<lb/> FIGURE 5 | Monocyte-derived dendritic cells convert retinal into retinoic acid, and increase B cell CD38 expression. Naive B cells and monocyte-derived dendritic<lb/> cells were co-cultured in vitamin A deficient medium in the presence of TD-dependent stimuli for 9 days, including interleukin-4, anti-CD40 and anti-IgM antibodies.<lb/> As a negative control naive B cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells were co-cultured with vehicle alone. (A) Representative histogram of CD38 expression on<lb/> naive B cells supplemented with natural retinal (green) or RA (black) during the 9 day coculture. Vehicle treatment is indicated with the dotted line. As a negative<lb/> control, cocultures were treated with vehicle alone (dotted line). (B) Quantification CD38 mean fluorescent intensity of naive B cells supplemented with unmodified retinal<lb/> (green), RA (black) or vehicle treated cells (white) from 4 separate experiments with individual blood donors (n=4). Data are presented as mean ± SD. ANOVA; **p &lt; 0.01.<lb/></figure>

			<p>We demonstrated that human peripheral B lymphocytes do not<lb/> possess ALDH enzymatic activity, but rely on DCs for RA<lb/> production. In the human gut, CD103 + ALDH + DCs are residing<lb/> within the lamina propria near the epithelium <ref type="biblio">(53, 54)</ref>. It was<lb/> demonstrated that human epithelial cells induce tolerogenic<lb/> properties in monocyte-derived DCs in vitro <ref type="biblio">(24)</ref>. Moreover,<lb/> mouse studies demonstrated that insufficient development of LP<lb/> tolerogenic DCs due to insufficient vitamin A metabolism, leads to<lb/> an impaired capacity to facilitate mucosal IgA class switching <ref type="biblio">(11,<lb/> 12, 55, 56)</ref>. The effect of RA for IgA expression within human B cells<lb/> has been demonstrated by others <ref type="biblio">(57)</ref>. Yet, within this study neither<lb/> our probes, nor natural RA, were able to significantly induce IgA<lb/> class switching within B lymphocytes in vitro. This might be due to<lb/> slightly different variations in the protocols, which we did not<lb/> further explore. Tolerogenic DCs are migratory cells and have<lb/> been observed to travel from the LP into the MLNs using CCR7<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(58)</ref>. It was reported in mice that these LP-derived DCs influence<lb/> the expression of the gut homing receptor a4b7 on T cells within<lb/> the MLNs, using retinoic acid <ref type="biblio">(9, 58-60)</ref>. Similarly, tolerogenic DCs<lb/> reside within human MLNs and have the ability to induce a4b7<lb/> expression on T cells <ref type="biblio">(10, 24)</ref>. Therefore, we postulate that human<lb/> tolerogenic DCs produce RA and are involved in the induction of<lb/> IgA class switching locally within the LP, but also in mucosal<lb/> lymphoid tissues such as the MLNs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thus, in this study, we provide user friendly clickable retinoid<lb/> probes, which can be used to visualize and examine functionality<lb/> of retinoids in a wide variety biological systems. We demonstrate<lb/> that multiple human immune populations have the capacity to<lb/> internalize retinoids to varying degrees. Naïve B lymphocytes<lb/> cannot metabolize retinoids themselves because they lack<lb/> ALDH1 activity, and thus rely on additional cells for RA<lb/> production. We showed that human DCs provide RA to B<lb/> cells, leading to upregulation of CD38. Together with existing<lb/> data based on mouse studies, these observations support that<lb/> human DCs facilitate adaptive B cell immunity in a retinoic acid<lb/> dependent manner. Taken together, our data provide valuable<lb/> insight into the mechanism behind vitamin A metabolism and<lb/> the importance of retinoids for human adaptive immunity.</p>
