			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>in the highlands of ethiopia, livestock production is<lb/> inseparably linked to crop production because of the<lb/> mixed crop livestock farming system <ref type="biblio">(alemu, 2016)</ref>.<lb/> one of the major constraints limiting the increased<lb/> livestock production on smallholder resource-poor<lb/> farms in the tropics is the inadequacy of animal feed<lb/> resources, especially during the dry season. natural<lb/> pasture and crop residues are the main feed resources<lb/> in the region. the quality and productivity of natural<lb/> pasture especially during the dry season is low. the<lb/> nutritive value of crop residues is inherently low<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Yenesew et al., 2015)</ref>. agro-industrial by-products<lb/> have a high nutritive value. however, they are expen-<lb/>sive and are less accessible to smallholder farmers in<lb/> rural areas.<lb/></p>

			<p>therefore, identifying alternative home-grown<lb/> protein supplements is crucial for improving livestock<lb/> production and productivity. Growing and using<lb/> legume crops with a high nutritive value are an<lb/> option to solve this problem. among grain legumes,<lb/> lupin species seem to be a realistic sustainable alter-<lb/>native source of protein in both monogastric and<lb/> ruminant feed that can replace soybean without loss<lb/> in the quantity and quality of livestock products<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Sedláková et al., 2016; White et al., 2007)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>White lupin (Lupinus albus) is one of the four cul-<lb/>tivated lupin species, and is a widely known annual<lb/> legume crop for human consumption and animal<lb/> feed in some countries. although a shortage of pro-<lb/>tein sources limits livestock production in ethiopia,<lb/> the contribution of lupin as a livestock feed has<lb/> remained negligible. in ethiopia, the local lupin vari-<lb/>ety, also known as Gibto is the predominant species<lb/> produced by small-scale farmers. Farmers produce<lb/> crops for multipurpose benefits, such as soil fertility<lb/> maintenance, nutritional value as snacks, local soup<lb/> and local alcohol preparation, and for traditional<lb/> therapy purposes <ref type="biblio">(Getachew, 2009; Shimels &amp; tizazu,<lb/> 2010)</ref>. Consequently, farmers have shown increasing<lb/> interest in cultivating white lupin <ref type="biblio">(Yeheyis et al.,<lb/> 2010)</ref>. the local bitter tasting lupin is widely grown<lb/> in the northwestern part of ethiopia for soil fertility<lb/> maintenance, forage, human consumption and as a<lb/> supplement to low-quality roughages.<lb/></p>

			<p>all of these food values, together with their role<lb/> in soil fertility maintenance, make white lupin a<lb/> dependable potential crop for the future. lupin is<lb/> produced as the sole crop or intercropped with other<lb/> crops. When white lupin is produced as a sole crop,<lb/> it is produced with minimum agronomic practices,<lb/> such as zero tillage, with no cultivation, and weeding<lb/> practices, which are the main causes of low produc-<lb/>tivity and inconsistent production status of the crop.<lb/> lupins have been shown to offer a safe, cost-effective<lb/> and high-protein feed supply for livestock as an<lb/> alternative to soybean (Glycine max l.). recently,<lb/> sweet varieties of lupine have been introduced into<lb/> the country. however, the potential benefits of lupin<lb/> as food and feed crops remain limited <ref type="biblio">(Yeheyis et al.,<lb/> 2010; Yilkal, 2011)</ref>. likewise, its production is limited<lb/> to the northern and northwest highlands of ethiopia<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(habtemariam et al., 2019)</ref>. evaluation of agronomic<lb/> performance and nutritional quality in different<lb/> agro-ecologies and locations of the country is import-<lb/>ant for devising exhaustive utilization protocols for<lb/> lupin species. in Chencha, in particular, and Gamo<lb/> highlands, in general, a shortage of feed is critical. at<lb/> the same time, lupin has never been cultivated in<lb/> this area. therefore, this study was initiated to evalu-<lb/>ate agronomic performances, yield and yield related<lb/> traits; and nutrient contents of three lupin grain<lb/> (local bitter, sanabor and vitabor) varieties at Gircha<lb/> research center, Gamo highlands.<lb/></p>

			<head>Materials and methods<lb/></head>

			<head>Study area<lb/></head>

			<p>the study was carried out in the Chencha district of<lb/> Gamo zone at Gircha highland Fruits and Vegetables<lb/> research Center, which is owned by arba Minch<lb/> University. Chencha District is situated between<lb/> 1300 m and 3250 m above sea level. astronomically<lb/> Chencha district is located between 37° 29′ 57″ east<lb/> to 37° 39′ 36″ West and between 60° 8′ 55″ north<lb/> and 60° 25′30″ South. the District has two<lb/> agro-ecological zones, namely, highland (&gt;2500 masl)<lb/> and midland (2000-2500 masl), which account for<lb/> approximately 82 and 18% of the total area, respec-<lb/>tively. owing to its rugged topography, the highland<lb/> area is highly vulnerable to soil erosion. the rainfall<lb/> regime in the district is bimodal. the first round of<lb/> rainfall occurred between March and april. the sec-<lb/>ond round of rainfall occurred from June to august.<lb/> rainfall distribution in Chencha varies from year to<lb/> year and across seasons. the annual rainfall distribu-<lb/>tion in the district varies between 900 and 1200 mm.<lb/> the average minimum and maximum temperatures<lb/> of the district are 12 and 20.1 degree centigrade,<lb/> respectively <ref type="biblio">(Fao, 1990)</ref>. the altitude of Gircha is<lb/> 3007 m above sea level <ref type="biblio">(WVe, 2012)</ref>. the farming sys-<lb/>tem in the district is a mixed farming system in<lb/> which crop and livestock subsystems are practiced.<lb/></p>

			<head>Experimental design and treatments<lb/></head>

			<p>three varieties (Sanabor, Vitabor and local) of lupin<lb/> grains were collected from the amhara regional<lb/> agricultural research institute (arari) Bahir Dar.<lb/> Sanabor and vitabor varieties are sweet, while the<lb/> local variety is bitter. the seeds were then manually<lb/> cleaned. a randomized complete block design (rCBD)<lb/> with five blocks and three plots per block was<lb/> employed. each of the three varieties were randomly<lb/> distributed in the plots of each block. a plot size of<lb/> 4 m × 5 m was used. the spacing was 7 cm between<lb/> plants and 30 cm between rows <ref type="biblio">(Yenesew et al., 2015)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>planting was conducted in the main rainy season<lb/> (June-July) during the two cropping years (2021 and<lb/> 2022). the land was cleaned and plowed 3 times<lb/> before planting to provide a fine seedbed. planted<lb/> species management activities such as hoeing, weed-<lb/>ing, diseases and pest inspection were conducted.<lb/> hand-weeding was conducted twice: once at the<lb/> seedling stage and once just before the flower-<lb/>ing stage.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data collection<lb/></head>

			<p>plant height (cm) was measured on five plants per<lb/> plot, selected randomly from the soil surface to the<lb/> tip of the plant. Grain yield per area unit (kg ha-1 ),<lb/> plant height (cm) and grain yield components,<lb/> including number of pods (plant-1 ), number of grains<lb/> (plant-1 ) and thousand grains mass (g) were mea-<lb/>sured. number of pods/plant, pod length (cm) and<lb/> number of seeds/pod were measured on 5 randomly<lb/> tagged plants/plot at maturity. the number of pods<lb/> per plant, pod length and number of seeds/pod<lb/> were measured in five randomly tagged plants/plots<lb/> at maturity. the analysis of plant height, number of<lb/> pods, number of grains and thousand-grain mass<lb/> was based on the samples taken immediately before<lb/> harvest. number of branches per plant was<lb/> determined for five randomly tagged plants/plot at<lb/> 50% flowering. to determine the 1000-seed weight,<lb/> 1000 seeds were randomly selected from the har-<lb/>vested seeds for each plot and weighed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Chemical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Chemical analysis of the different varieties was car-<lb/>ried out at hawassa University, animal nutrition lab-<lb/>oratory. after harvest, the dry seeds of each lupin<lb/> variety were ground separately to obtain grain flour.<lb/> the samples were then ground to pass through a<lb/> 1-mm sieve, and the ground samples were used for<lb/> laboratory analysis. the samples were analyzed on<lb/> a% DM basis for crude protein (Cp), DM and ash<lb/> determination following the procedure described by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">aoaC (2005)</ref>. the acid detergent fiber (aDF) and acid<lb/> detergent lignin (aDl) components of each ingredi-<lb/>ent and feces were determined according to the pro-<lb/>cedures of <ref type="biblio">Van Soest and robertson (1985)</ref>, whereas<lb/> the nDF content was analyzed following the proce-<lb/>dures of <ref type="biblio">Vansoest et al. (1991)</ref>. ash content was<lb/> determined by heating the samples in a furnace at<lb/> 550 °C overnight, and organic matter (oM) content<lb/> was calculated as DM minus ash <ref type="biblio">(aoaC, 2005)</ref>.<lb/> nitrogen (n) content was determined following the<lb/> micro-Kjeldahl digestion, distillation and titration<lb/> procedures <ref type="biblio">(aoaC, 2005)</ref>, and the Cp content was<lb/> estimated by multiplying the n content by 6.25.<lb/> Moisture, crude fat, crude protein and ash contents<lb/> were assessed according to the methodologies<lb/> detailed in <ref type="biblio">aoaC (2005)</ref>. the contents of major min-<lb/>erals such as calcium (Ca), phosphorus (p), iron (Fe)<lb/> and zinc (Zn) were analyzed using atomic absorption<lb/> and mass spectrometry <ref type="biblio">(2005)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cost-benefit analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>the purchasing prices of lupin seeds were known,<lb/> and the selling price was estimated in Birr/kg. the<lb/> selling price of lupin grain per hectare was also cal-<lb/>culated. the labor costs (land preparation, sowing,<lb/> weeding and harvesting) were common for all treat-<lb/>ments/varieties. partial budgeting is used to assess<lb/> the profitability of any new technology to be<lb/> imposed on agricultural businesses <ref type="biblio">(Upton, 1979)</ref>.<lb/> the net return was estimated for each variety yield<lb/> (kg ha-1 ) observation produced on average farm gate<lb/> prices of local, sanabor and vitabor varieties.<lb/></p>

			<p>to measure the increase in net return associated<lb/> with each additional unit of cost (marginal cost), the<lb/> marginal rate of return (Mrr) was calculated as:<lb/> ΔNI/ΔiC; Where, Mrr is the marginal rate of returns,<lb/> Δni -change in net income compared with control/<lb/> local variety, and ΔiC -change in input cost com-<lb/>pared with control. the following points were consid-<lb/>ered during cost benefit analysis using a<lb/> partial budget.<lb/></p>

			<list>
				<item>•<lb/>Costs for all agronomic practices were uniform<lb/> for all treatments within sites.<lb/></item>
				<item>•<lb/> Costs, returns and benefit were calculated per<lb/> hectare basis.<lb/></item>
			</list>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>the raw data were subjected to anoVa and ana-<lb/>lyzed using SaS statistical software (SaS, 2009) ver-<lb/>sion 9.2. When the analysis of variance revealed the<lb/> existence of significant differences among the treat-<lb/>ments, means were separated using tukey&apos;s test. the<lb/> following statistical model was used for the data<lb/> analysis:<lb/></p>

				<formula>Yij<lb/> vi bj eij<lb/> = + + +<lb/> µ<lb/> ,<lb/></formula>

			<p>where Yij is the response variable (the observation in<lb/> jth block and ith treatment), µ is the overall mean, vi<lb/> is the variety effect, bj is the block effect and eij is<lb/> the random error.<lb/></p>

			<head>Result and discussion<lb/></head>

			<head>Agronomic performances<lb/></head>

			<p>agronomic performance (plant height, days to flow-<lb/>ering and maturity, number of tillers and straw dry<lb/> matter yield) is presented in table 1. plant height<lb/> (cm) at maturity was recorded to be 79.7, 86 and<lb/> 79.9, respectively, for local, Sanabor and Vitabor vari-<lb/>eties, respectively. no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05)<lb/> were observed in plant height among the lupin grain<lb/></p>

			<p>varieties. lower than the present results, plant<lb/> heights (cm) of 67.7 and 53.8 were reported for<lb/> sanabor and Vitabor varieties grown in Dabat District<lb/> of north Gondar Zone <ref type="biblio">(Friehiwot et al., 2019)</ref>. plant<lb/> heights (cm) of 80-124 also noted for inoculated<lb/> white lupin <ref type="biblio">(Sulas et al., 2012)</ref>. Mean plant height of<lb/> 82 cm for different lupine varieties was reported by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">rudloff (2011)</ref>. this discrepancy may be due to envi-<lb/>ronmental variations in the study area. <ref type="formula">edwards et al.<lb/> (2011)</ref> also reported that the plant height of<lb/> narrow-leafed lupin varieties varied from 20 to 100 cm.<lb/> Days to flowering were significantly different<lb/> (p &lt; 0.001) between the local (67.7 days) and sweet<lb/> varieties (52.8 and 55.8 days for the sanabor and<lb/> Vitabor varieties, respectively). Similar results on days<lb/> to flowering of sanabor (58.33 days) and Vitabor<lb/> (60.66 days) varieties have been reported <ref type="biblio">(Fikadu,<lb/> 2021)</ref>. Days to flowering in Sanabor has been<lb/> reported to be 87 days <ref type="biblio">(Friehiwot et al., 2019)</ref>. the<lb/> variation in days to flowering might be associated<lb/> with the soil types and varietal differences. the days<lb/> to plant maturity in the current study were signifi-<lb/>cantly different (p &lt; 0.020) for the local and sweet<lb/> varieties. the highest number of days to maturity<lb/> was recorded (140 days) for the local lupin grain vari-<lb/>eties. <ref type="biblio">Fikadu (2021)</ref> also reported days to maturity<lb/> for sanabor and Vitabor at 117.33 and 119.66 days,<lb/> respectively. in a similar study, longer days of matu-<lb/>rity (167-233 days) were reported in the Mecha and<lb/> Sekela districts of the West Gojjam zone <ref type="biblio">(Zerihun,<lb/> 2012)</ref>. this may be due to agro-ecological variations<lb/> in the study locations/sites. Mergia (2021) noted<lb/> number of branches, pods/plant and straw dry mat-<lb/>ter yield (t/h) of sanabor variety as 11-20, 23-35 and<lb/> 0.52-1.6, respectively, for different accessions of lupin<lb/> in the highlands of ethiopia. the local variety (4.06t/h)<lb/> and sanabor (3.85 t/h) had the highest forage straw<lb/> yield. <ref type="biblio">Yenesew et al. (2015)</ref> reported mean straw dry<lb/> matter yield of 4.2 ± 2.91 (t/h) for sweet lupine in<lb/> south achefer district. Very low straw dry matter<lb/> yield (t/h) of 1.45 and 1.53 were reported for Sanabor<lb/> and Vitabor in Gondar area <ref type="biblio">(alemu et al., 2019)</ref>.<lb/> Forage yield of 0.6-1.7 tons per hectare were<lb/> recorded for vitabor and sanabor varieties at midland<lb/> and highland altitudes in the gojjam area <ref type="biblio">(Fikadu,<lb/> 2021)</ref>. these variations in number of branches and<lb/> straw yield, might be due to environment and geno-<lb/>type differences.<lb/></p>

			<head>Grain yield and related traits<lb/></head>

			<p>the grain yields and yield-related traits of the three<lb/> lupin grain varieties are presented in table 2. the<lb/> number of pods per plant was not significantly<lb/> (p &gt; 0.05) affected by the variety, with an overall<lb/> range of 19.35 to 21.1 pods/plant. the number of<lb/> pods per plant (55.59) for sanabor and (52.17) for<lb/> Vitabor were noted <ref type="biblio">(Fikadu, 2021)</ref>. this may be asso-<lb/>ciated with differences in soil fertility levels and other<lb/> management practices. the number of pods per<lb/> plant was 8.1 to 16.9 pods/plant was reported in the<lb/> highlands of ethiopia <ref type="biblio">(Friehiwot et al., 2019)</ref>. a very<lb/> small (5.4) mean pod number per plant has been<lb/> reported <ref type="biblio">(pospišil, 2015)</ref>. pod length was significantly<lb/> different (p &lt; 0.01) and was higher for the local vari-<lb/>ety. a mean pod length of 4.3 cm was reported by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Fikadu (2021)</ref> for sanabor and Vitabor varieties in the<lb/> lemo and hadya zones. Similar findings on the num-<lb/>ber of seeds per pod (4.09) for the haag blue variety<lb/> have been reported in Gondar Zuria <ref type="biblio">(alemu<lb/> et al., 2019)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>the same author noted 4.35-4.95 seeds per pod<lb/> for Vitabor and Sanabor sweet lupin varieties. the<lb/> number of pods per plant has been reported to be<lb/> 3.7-6.8 for different varieties <ref type="biblio">(Vojislav et al., 2008)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>the number of seeds per pod in the present study<lb/> was relatively higher than the range value of values<lb/> 4.33 to 4.67 reported by <ref type="biblio">teklay et al. (2015)</ref> for Bora<lb/> and Sanabor genotypes tested in the tigray region.<lb/> Different genotypes performed differently in the<lb/> number of seeds per pod at different locations,<lb/> which might be attributed to variations in<lb/> agro-ecological conditions, such as soil-associated<lb/> factors, moisture, temperature and management<lb/> practices. pod length, number of seeds per pod and<lb/> grain yield were significantly influenced by crop years.<lb/></p>

			<p>the 1000 seed weights of lupin varieties varied<lb/> significantly (p &lt; 0.001), and the highest (3895 gm)<lb/></p>

Comparable to the present find-<lb/>ings, <ref type="biblio">temesgen (2019)</ref> noted a mean seed yield per<lb/> hectare of 3.982.29 ton for different lupin grain acces-<lb/>sions in the amhara region. Grain yield of sweet<lb/> lupin (Sanabor) was reported to be 2.2 t ha-1 to 4.8<lb/> t ha-1 depending on the area <ref type="biblio">(Yeheyis et al., 2010)</ref>.<lb/> Similarly, <ref type="biblio">Fikadu (2021)</ref> recorded grain yield of 2.52<lb/> and 2.61 t/h for Vitabor and sanabor varieties in<lb/> lemmo district hadya zone. lower than that in the<lb/> current study, <ref type="biblio">Vojislav et al. (2008)</ref> revealed a grain<lb/> yield of 1.425-3.005 (t/h) for different lupin grain<lb/> varieties.<lb/></p>

			<head>Chemical composition<lb/></head>

			<p>the chemical composition of the lupin grain varieties<lb/> tested is listed in table <ref type="table">3</ref>. there were no significant<lb/> differences (p &gt; 0.05) in DM, ash, ee and aDl con-<lb/>tents among the different varieties. higher Crude<lb/> protein (Cp) content recorded for local variety<lb/> (29.08%) than Vitabor variety (24.19%). higher nDF<lb/> values were recorded for sanabor and Vitabor than<lb/> for the local variety. Similar dry matter content (92%)<lb/> were reported for the same crop <ref type="biblio">(Yilkal, 2011)</ref>. higher<lb/> dry matter (94%) has also reported in local varieties<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Mazumder et al., 2021)</ref>. <ref type="biblio">Mergia (2022)</ref> reported simi-<lb/>lar Cp content of 22.5% for sanabor variety in the<lb/> highlands of ethiopia. <ref type="biblio">Fikadu (2021)</ref> reported slightly<lb/> different (22.4% and 21.85%) of crude protein for<lb/> Vitabor and Sanabor varieties, respectively. the same<lb/> author noted higher nDF (47%) content for both<lb/> Vitabor and Sanabor varieties. Similarly, higher pro-<lb/>tein (39%) and fat (9.1%) was reported for local vari-<lb/>ety <ref type="biblio">(Biadge et al., 2022)</ref>.<lb/> a total ash content of 3.2% for local lupin grains<lb/> was reported by <ref type="biblio">Shimels and tizazu (2010)</ref>.<lb/> Differences may arise because of the soil/location,<lb/> agro-ecology and season of grain cultivation.<lb/> <ref type="formula">teshome et al. (2012)</ref>, who collected two bitter lupin<lb/> samples from amahara region (Gojjam), obtained<lb/> protein contents 38.92% (Dangela) and 37.56%<lb/> (Chagini), which is comparable to the study by <ref type="biblio">Kefale<lb/> and abrha (2018)</ref>, who noted protein content of<lb/> 31.65% for sweet lupin grain.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cost-benefit analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>partial budgeting is a planning and decision-making<lb/> framework used to compare the costs and benefits<lb/> of alternatives for a farm business. although the<lb/> local variety was able to produce a higher grain yield<lb/> of 42,660 kg-h, its market price is not comparable to<lb/> that of the sweet varieties; hence, the net return is<lb/> far less than that of the sanabor and vitabor varieties<lb/> (table <ref type="table">5</ref>). the highest net and marginal rates of<lb/> return were recorded for the sanabor variety. this<lb/> may be because local people prefer to fetch high<lb/> prices. the highest net benefit of Birr 1,617,650 ha-1<lb/> was recorded for the sanabor variety, whereas the<lb/> lowest net benefit of Birr 608,400 ha-1 was obtained<lb/> from the local variety. the marginal analysis results<lb/> revealed that Sanabor had a marginal rate of return<lb/> (Mrr) of 310.54%, which is well above the minimum<lb/> acceptable rate of return (100%). this shows that<lb/> farmers could receive a net return of Birr 2.96 for<lb/> each Birr invested in the Sonabor variety rather than<lb/> the local variety. Marginal rate of return (Mrr) of<lb/> 491.76% was obtained from Vitabor, which is higher<lb/> than Sanabor. therefore, the Vitabor variety of grain<lb/> was economically feasible and recommended based<lb/> on partial budget analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>all the tested varieties perform well in terms of plant<lb/> height, number of tillers and grain yield parameters.<lb/> Difference in growth and yield performances were<lb/> also recorded among the different varieties. the local<lb/> variety performs better than the introduced sweet<lb/> varieties in grain yield. Demonstration of these (sweet<lb/> varieties) to farmers and awareness creation about<lb/> their utilization is suggested.<lb/></p>
