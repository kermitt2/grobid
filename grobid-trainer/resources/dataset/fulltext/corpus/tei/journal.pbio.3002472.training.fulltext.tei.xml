			<p>The horizontal exchange of genetic material-also known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-<lb/>is a pervasive force in microbial ecology and evolution <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. HGT is particularly important<lb/> within the human gut microbiota, where hundreds of species coexist with each other in close<lb/> physical proximity <ref type="biblio">[2-4]</ref>. HGT is often associated with the acquisition of new genes or path-<lb/>ways, which can confer resistance to antibiotics <ref type="biblio">[3-8]</ref> or enable novel metabolic capabilities<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[3,9-14]</ref>. Genetic material can also be transferred between more closely related strains, where<lb/> it can overwrite existing regions of the genome via homologous recombination <ref type="biblio">[15,16]</ref>. This<lb/> more subtle form of horizontal exchange acts to reshuffle genetic variants within species, simi-<lb/>lar to meiotic recombination in sexual organisms. Homologous recombination plays a crucial<lb/> role in microbial evolution, from the emergence of new bacterial species <ref type="biblio">[17-20]</ref> to the transi-<lb/>tion between clonal and quasi-sexual evolution <ref type="biblio">[21-23]</ref>. Homologous recombination can also<lb/> serve as a scaffold for the incorporation of novel genetic material, which can facilitate the<lb/> spread of accessory genes across different strain backgrounds <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref>. However, while numerous<lb/> studies have established the pervasiveness of bacterial recombination <ref type="biblio">[21,25-28]</ref>, the<lb/> evolutionary dynamics of this process are still poorly understood in natural populations like<lb/> the gut microbiota.<lb/></p>

			<p>Multiple methods have been developed for inferring in situ recombination from the fine-<lb/>scale diversity of natural bacterial isolates <ref type="biblio">[26,27,29-33]</ref>. The key challenge lies in disentangl-<lb/>ing the effects of recombination from the other evolutionary forces (e.g., mutation, selection,<lb/> and genetic drift) that shape genetic diversity over the same timescales. Existing studies often<lb/> address this problem using an inverse approach, by fitting the observed data to simple<lb/> parametric models from microbial population genetics. Examples range from simple summary<lb/> statistics like linkage disequilibrium <ref type="biblio">[26,27,34,35]</ref> and related metrics <ref type="biblio">[21,28,32,33,36-40]</ref> to<lb/> complete probabilistic reconstructions of the genealogies of the sampled genomes <ref type="biblio">[29-31]</ref>.<lb/> Previous applications of these methods have provided extensive evidence for ongoing recom-<lb/>bination within the core genomes of many bacterial species <ref type="biblio">[25,41]</ref>-including many species<lb/> of human gut bacteria <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, many of these existing methods rely on simplified evolutionary scenarios, which<lb/> ignore the effects of natural selection, and make additional restrictive assumptions about the<lb/> demographic structure of the population. Recent work has shown that these simplified models<lb/> often fail to capture key features of microbial genetic diversity <ref type="biblio">[26-28,42]</ref>, which can strongly<lb/> bias estimates of the underlying recombination parameters. Our limited understanding of<lb/> these effects makes it difficult to answer key questions about the role of recombination in natu-<lb/>ral populations like the gut microbiota: Is recombination fast enough to allow local adaptations<lb/> to persist within a host, e.g., during fecal microbiota transplants <ref type="biblio">[43]</ref> or sudden dietary shifts<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[44]</ref>? Does natural selection tend to promote or hinder the spread of genetic variants across<lb/> different strain backgrounds? And can the rates and lengths of transferred fragments shed<lb/> light on the underlying mechanisms of recombination in situ?<lb/></p>

			<p>Here, we show that the genetic structure of the human gut microbiome provides a unique<lb/> opportunity to address these questions. Using strain-resolved metagenomics, we show that the<lb/> large sample sizes and host colonization structure of this ecosystem enable systematic compari-<lb/>sons of strains across a broad range of distance and timescales, from the scale of individual<lb/> hosts to the diversity of the broader global population. We show that some of these strains are<lb/> closely related enough that one can resolve homologous recombination events directly, with-<lb/>out requiring restrictive modeling assumptions or explicit phylogenetic inference. We use<lb/> these observations to develop a nonparametric approach for identifying large numbers of<lb/> recent recombination events within 29 prevalent species of human gut bacteria. This compara-<lb/>tive data set allows us to systematically explore the landscape of homologous recombination in<lb/> this host-associated ecosystem.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our results reveal extensive heterogeneity in rates and lengths of transferred fragments-<lb/>both among different species and between different strains of the same species-which are dif-<lb/>ficult to explain by ecological isolation or reduced efficiencies of recombination. We also find<lb/> that natural selection can play an important role in facilitating the spread of transferred frag-<lb/>ments into different strain backgrounds. Our results suggest that in situ recombination events<lb/> are shaped by a combination of evolutionary processes, which may strongly depend on the<lb/> ecological context of their host community.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<head>Partially recombined genomes underlie the broad range of genetic diversity<lb/> in many species of gut bacteria<lb/></head>

			<p>To quantify the dynamics of homologous recombination across different timescales, we ana-<lb/>lyzed shotgun metagenomic data from a collection of healthy human gut microbiomes that we<lb/> collated in a previous study <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. This data set comprises 932 fecal samples from 693 subjects<lb/> from North America, Europe, and China (<ref type="table">S1</ref> Table). We used a reference-based approach to<lb/> identify single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the core genome of each species in each sample<lb/> (Section 1 in S1 Text). These metagenomic variants reflect a complex mixture of the global<lb/> genetic diversity within a given species, as well as the specific combination of lineages that are<lb/> present within a given host. While it is difficult to resolve the underlying lineages in the most<lb/> general case, we previously showed <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref> that the lineage structure in many human gut meta-<lb/>genomes is simple enough that the core genome of the dominant strain can be inferred with a<lb/> high degree of confidence (Fig <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">A</ref> in S1 Text). Using this approach, we obtained a<lb/> total of 5,416 &quot;quasi-phased&quot; genomes from 43 different species in 541 unique hosts. The<lb/> genetic differences between these strains provide a window into the long-term evolutionary<lb/> forces that operate in these species over multiple host colonization cycles.<lb/></p>

			<p>Previous work has shown that the genetic diversity within many species of gut bacteria<lb/> spans a broad range of timescales <ref type="biblio">[27,45]</ref>. For example, in Alistipes putredinis (a prominent<lb/> gut commensal), the synonymous divergence between a typical pair of strains is d�2%, but<lb/> some pairs of strains are separated by just a handful of SNVs (Fig <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). Similar pairs of closely<lb/> related strains have been observed in other bacterial species, where they are often associated<lb/> with clinical outbreaks or other local transmission processes <ref type="biblio">[21,36,46]</ref>. In our case, the<lb/> breadth of sampling of the human gut microbiome allows us to rule out many of these microe-<lb/>pidemic factors, since closely related strains are frequently observed in unrelated hosts from<lb/> different countries <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Population genetic theory predicts that similar patterns can also arise due to the local nature<lb/> of bacterial recombination <ref type="biblio">[28,39]</ref>. Since the length of a typical recombined segment (ℓ r ) is<lb/> usually much shorter than the total genome length (L), there is a broad range of timescales<lb/> between the first recombination event (T r ) and the time required for the genome to be<lb/> completely overwritten by imported fragments (T mosaic � T r � L=&apos; r ; Fig <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In quasi-sexual bacterial populations, most pairs of strains will share a common ancestor<lb/> T mrca �T mosaic generations ago, so that their present-day genomes comprise a mosaic of over-<lb/>lapping recombination events. However, in a large enough sample, some pairs of strains will<lb/> inevitably share a common ancestor on timescales much shorter than T mosaic (Fig <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Among<lb/> these &quot;closely related&quot; strains, recombination will not have had enough time to completely<lb/> cover the ancestral genome with DNA from other, more typically diverged strains. Rather,<lb/> individual recombination events will be visible as &quot;blocks&quot; of typical genetic divergence against<lb/> a backdrop of nearly identical DNA sequence <ref type="biblio">[28,39]</ref>. These partially recombined genomes<lb/> have previously been observed in other bacterial species-most notably in Escherichia coli<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[28,39]</ref> and other bacterial pathogens <ref type="biblio">[42,47,48]</ref>. Fig <ref type="figure">1D</ref> shows that similar examples can be<lb/> observed within the A. putredinis population as well.<lb/></p>

			<p>To test whether this pattern holds more broadly, we divided the core genome of each pair of<lb/> strains into blocks of 1,000 synonymous sites and calculated the fraction of blocks with zero SNV<lb/> differences within them. In a pair of partially recombined genomes, we would expect to see a neg-<lb/>ative correlation between the fraction of identical blocks (a proxy for the fraction of clonal ances-<lb/>try) and the overall genetic divergence across the genome (Fig <ref type="figure">1E</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">B</ref> in S1 Text). One can<lb/> observe such a trend in A. putredinis (Fig <ref type="figure">1C</ref>)-well beyond that expected from the randomness<lb/> of individual mutations. Instead, we find that a simple model of accumulated transfers (red line;<lb/> Section 2 in S1 Text) can account for a large fraction of the spread in genome-wide divergence in<lb/> A. putredinis, consistent with the partial recombination model in Fig <ref type="figure">1B</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similar patterns can be observed in many other gut commensals (Figs <ref type="figure">C and D</ref> in S1 Text).<lb/> Some species exhibit some variation in the divergence of the most distantly related strains<lb/> (e.g., Bacteroides vulgatus and Eubacterium rectale), consistent with the presence of subspecies<lb/> or other forms of population structure <ref type="biblio">[18,27,49]</ref>. Yet even in these cases, we find that partially<lb/> recombined genomes can still account for much of the variation among more closely related<lb/> strains. Across species, we find that our simple model of accumulated transfers can explain<lb/> more than 50% of the weighted variation in pairwise divergence within 36 of the 43 species we<lb/></p>

(A) Genetic differences between<lb/> the core genomes of the dominant strain of a given species (&gt;80% within-host frequency) are inferred from pairwise comparisons of metagenomes from<lb/> unrelated hosts (Section 1 in S1 Text). (B) Timescales of recombination in a quasi-sexual bacterial population: most strains share a common ancestor �<lb/> T mosaic generations ago, so their present-day genomes are completely overwritten by recombination; in large samples, some pairs of strains will share a<lb/> common ancestor � T mosaic generations ago, and recombination events will be visible as blocks of local divergence against a shared clonal background.

(F)<lb/> Inferred values of T mrca /T mosaic for the partial recombination model in Section 2 in S1 Text; 2 additional species (H. pylori and M. tuberculosis) are shown<lb/> on the right for comparison. The data underlying this figure can be found in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10304481.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002472.g001<lb/></figure>

			<p>examined (Fig <ref type="figure">F</ref> in S1 Text). The implied amounts of recombination are often quite large<lb/> (T mrca /T mosaic ≳10, Fig <ref type="figure">1F</ref>) and are comparable to highly recombinant species like Helicobacter<lb/> pylori. These estimates suggest that typical pairs of strains have been completely overwritten by<lb/> recombination events (Fig <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the generality of this trend, the total number of closely related strains can vary sub-<lb/>stantially between species (S2 Table<ref type="table">)</ref>. For example, many Alistipes and Bacteroides species con-<lb/>tain hundreds of closely related pairs, while other species like Prevotella copri have only a<lb/> handful. While the causes of these differences are currently unclear, the simplified patterns of<lb/> recombination among these strains suggest that we can use them to directly resolve individual<lb/> recombination events within a range of different species.<lb/></p>

			<head>Measuring individual recombination events that accumulate between<lb/> closely related strains in different hosts<lb/></head>

			<p>To identify individual recombination events across a diverse range of human gut species, we<lb/> turned to an automated approach for analyzing the spatial distribution of genetic differences<lb/> along the core genomes of closely related pairs of strains. We chose to focus on the core<lb/> genome to limit the impact of plasmids and other mobile genetic elements, which can be hori-<lb/>zontally transmitted at much higher rates than normal chromosomal DNA <ref type="biblio">[50-52]</ref>. By<lb/> restricting our attention to core genes, we sought to infer the baseline rates of recombination<lb/> that shape the evolution of the larger genome, which involve the permanent replacement of<lb/> existing sequences in addition to successful transfers.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our pairwise model assumes that the genetic differences along the core genome arise<lb/> through a mixture of 2 processes: (i) point mutations (which alter individual sites); and (ii)<lb/> homologous recombination events (which replace longer stretches of DNA with a correspond-<lb/>ing fragment sampled from another strain in the populations). For sufficiently close pairs, the<lb/> mutation and recombination processes have a negligible chance of overlapping, which means<lb/> that they can be captured by a simple hidden Markov model (HMM) that transitions between<lb/> clonal and recombined regions at different locations along the genome (Fig <ref type="figure">2B</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">G</ref> in S1<lb/> Text; Section 3.1 in S1 Text). The corresponding transition rates between these states will vary<lb/> between different pairs of strains, due to the differences in their time-aggregated rates of<lb/> recombination. Since the genealogies of close pairs are particularly simple, these pairwise esti-<lb/>mates can implicitly capture various forms of selection, non-equilibrium demography, and<lb/> other deviations from the simplest neutral null models, even when there is insufficient data for<lb/> a complete phylogenetic reconstruction.<lb/></p>

			<p>In contrast to previous approaches <ref type="biblio">[28-31,53]</ref>, we used the empirical distribution of local<lb/> divergence to model the number of SNVs imported by each recombined fragment (Section 3.1<lb/> in S1 Text). This allows us to capture the broad variation observed in different transfers (Fig <ref type="figure">H</ref><lb/> in S1 Text) in a way that is directly informed by the available data. We validated the perfor-<lb/>mance of our algorithm (CP-HMM) through simulations and found that it can reliably iden-<lb/>tify individual recombination events across a range of genetic divergence scales (Figs <ref type="figure">I-L</ref> in S1<lb/> Text; Section 3.2 in S1 Text).<lb/></p>

			<p>Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows an example of this approach applied to B. vulgatus, one of the most abundant<lb/> and prevalent species in the human gut. Previous work <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref> has shown that this species pos-<lb/>sesses a strong population structure with 2 major clades (corresponding to the vulgatus and<lb/> dorei subspecies <ref type="biblio">[54]</ref>), such that the within-clade divergence is approximately 10-fold smaller<lb/> than the divergence between clades (Fig <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). We exploited this structure to further resolve the<lb/> recombination events into within-and between-clade transfers based on their local sequence<lb/> divergence (Fig <ref type="figure">2B</ref>, Section 3.1 in S1 Text). By applying our HMM algorithm to the 210 pairs<lb/> of closely related B. vulgatus strains in our cohort, we identified a total of �1,700 recombined<lb/> regions with a mean length of �20 kb (<ref type="table">S3</ref> Table). We also applied our algorithm to a separate<lb/> collection of B. vulgatus isolate genomes (Fig <ref type="figure">O</ref> in S1 Text; Section 3.10 in S1 Text) to verify<lb/> that our conclusions were robust to the quasi-phasing approach employed in Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>We observed an overall trend toward larger numbers of recombination events in strains with<lb/> higher clonal divergence (Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>), consistent with the gradual accumulation of successful transfers<lb/> over time. However, the larger sample reveals that this is not a simple linear relationship: Some<lb/> strains have anomalously large numbers of transfers even at low clonal divergence, while others<lb/> have anomalously few transfers even at high clonal divergence (Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). Similar results are also<lb/> observed when considering the cumulative length of the recombined genome for each pair (Fig <ref type="figure">M</ref><lb/> in S1 Text), which confirms that this variation is not an artifact of the event detection algorithm.<lb/> Instead, these data suggest that successful transfers in B. vulgatus do not accumulate at a fixed<lb/> recombination rate, as assumed under the simplest models of neutral evolution.<lb/></p>

			<p>We also found that recombination between the major B. vulgatus clades occurred much less<lb/> frequently than recombination within clades, with a ~5-fold reduction in the total number of<lb/> detected transfers as a function of their genetic divergence (Fig <ref type="figure">2C</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">J</ref> in S1 Text). This<lb/> genetic isolation could arise from several factors, ranging from reduced opportunities for<lb/> recombination (e.g., due to ecological isolation <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref> or fewer homologous flanking regions for<lb/> initiating strand invasion <ref type="biblio">[55,56]</ref>) to greater downstream incompatibilities in the acquired<lb/> fragments (e.g., epistatic interactions <ref type="biblio">[57,58]</ref> or mismatch-repair-mediated proofreading<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[59,60]</ref>). In this case, the larger ensemble of detected transfers allows us to further distinguish<lb/> between these scenarios. Beyond the reduction in the number of detected recombination<lb/> events, we also observed a systematic difference in the lengths of the individual transfers, with<lb/> a ~7-fold reduction in the median transfer length between clades (Fig <ref type="figure">2D</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">J</ref> in S1 Text).<lb/> These differences indicate that the greater genetic isolation of the B. vulgatus clades cannot be<lb/> captured by a simple rescaling of the recombination rate and that additional factors like epista-<lb/>sis or mismatch-repair-mediated proofreading are necessary to explain the data.<lb/></p>

			<head>Variation of recombination rates within and across gut species<lb/></head>

			<p>To understand how these results for B. vulgatus extend to other members of the gut micro-<lb/>biome, we applied the same approach to the other species in our data set with a sufficient<lb/></p>

(A) Schematic illustration for B. vulgatus, which has<lb/> a strong population structure with 2 major clades. (B) Our pairwise hidden Markov model (CP-HMM) classifies the core enome of each pair of closely<lb/> related strains into clonal regions (gray) and recombined regions (blue = within-clade, orange = between-clade) based on their local synonymous<lb/> divergence; points denote individual SNVs, while lines show the local divergence in sliding 1,000 bp windows. Data from 2 example pairs are shown. (C)<lb/> The observed number of recombination events in all pairs of closely related B. vulgatus strains as a function of the synonymous divergence in their inferred<lb/> clonal regions (Section 3.1 in S1 Text). These events are further partitioned into within-clade and between-clade transfers (top and bottom). Lines indicate<lb/> the average trend computed using a local regression technique, while shaded regions indicate the local spread (Section 3.3 in S1 Text). (D) Distribution of<lb/> the estimated transfer lengths for each of the recombination events in panel C. These data show that the rates and lengths of successful transfers strongly<lb/> depend on the divergence of the imported fragments. The data underlying this figure can be found in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10304481.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002472.g002<lb/></figure>

			<p>number of closely related strains. This pairwise analysis yielded a total of 228,078 recombined<lb/> regions in 7,383 closely related pairs from 29 different species. These data revealed systematic<lb/> variations in the rates and lengths of transferred fragments across many prevalent gut species<lb/> (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> and Figs <ref type="figure">P-R</ref> in S1 Text), similar to E. coli and other bacterial pathogens <ref type="biblio">[16,61-63]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>We found that some of these trends were consistent with the phylogenetic relationships<lb/> between species. For example, species in the Rikenellaceae family tended to have relatively fre-<lb/>quent and short transfers, while Bacteroidaceae family tended to have lower rates and longer<lb/> transfers. However, we also observed large differences within individual genera. For example,<lb/> Bacteroides massiliensis has a relatively linear accumulation of transfers over time (Fig <ref type="figure">3B</ref>),<lb/> while most pairs of Bacteroides caccae strains have few detected recombination events (Fig<lb/> <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). The typical transfer length varies among Bacteroides species as well (6 to 35 kb), spanning<lb/> a larger range than Alistipes (3 to 6 kb).<lb/></p>

For species with &lt; 100 close pairs, we plot the distribution of apparent recombination rates for all individual pairs; box plots indicate the<lb/> median and inter-quartile range. (E) Lengths of recombined fragments for each of the species in panel D.

The data underlying this figure can be found in<lb/> https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10304481.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002472.g003<lb/></figure>

			<p>Zooming in further, we also observed considerable variation within individual species.<lb/> Some of these differences could be attributed to the presence of strong population structure<lb/> (similar to B. vulgatus), with a reduction in both the rates and lengths of successful transfers<lb/> between highly diverged clades (e.g., Alistipes Shahii; Fig <ref type="figure">V</ref> in S1 Text). However, we also<lb/> observed substantial variation even in the absence of population structure. For example, A.<lb/> putredinis contains many closely related strains with an anomalously large number of trans-<lb/>fers, as well as an excess of more diverged strains with few recombined segments (Fig <ref type="figure">3C</ref> and<lb/> >Fig <ref type="figure">K</ref> in S1 Text). Other species (e.g., B. caccae; Fig <ref type="figure">3A</ref>) exhibited bimodal distributions of<lb/> transferred fragments. None of these behaviors can be captured by a single underlying recom-<lb/>bination rate.<lb/></p>

			<p>Interestingly, apart from the handful of species with strong population structure, we<lb/> observed no systematic trend between the frequency of recombination and the divergence of<lb/> the transferred fragments (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">W</ref> in S1 Text), as expected under certain models of<lb/> homologous recombination <ref type="biblio">[19,64]</ref>. This observation, in combination with the large number<lb/> of species in our data set, helps shed further light on the mechanisms that could be responsible<lb/> for the lower recombination rates we observe between clades. For example, B. thetaiotaomi-<lb/>cron and B. stercoris both maintain high recombination rates at synonymous divergences com-<lb/>parable to the genetically isolated clades observed in B. vulgatus and B. finegoldii (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref> and Fig<lb/> <ref type="figure">W</ref> in S1 Text). This suggests that the genetic isolation of these clades is not a product of their<lb/> underlying recombination machinery (which should be similar in different Bacteroides spe-<lb/>cies) but rather by genetic incompatibilities that have accumulated between the 2 clades, or<lb/> related scenarios like incompatible restriction-modification systems <ref type="biblio">[65-68]</ref>. Understanding<lb/> the ecological and evolutionary forces that caused these incompatibilities to emerge within<lb/> some Bacteroides species but not others is an interesting avenue for future work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Signatures of within-host recombination in co-colonized hosts<lb/></head>

			<p>Our preceding analysis focused on the successful transfers that have accumulated between<lb/> closely related strains in unrelated hosts. How do these long-term dynamics-which aggregate<lb/> over multiple host colonization cycles-emerge from the local processes of competition and<lb/> colonization within individual hosts?<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>Some of this recombination could occur when multiple strains of the same species are pres-<lb/>ent within the same host <ref type="biblio">[69]</ref>. While examples of co-colonization are less common in the<lb/> human gut <ref type="biblio">[27,45]</ref>, we can still identify many individual hosts in our larger cohort in which 2<lb/> diverged strains were present at intermediate frequencies, based on the frequencies of SNVs<lb/> within their corresponding metagenomes (Fig <ref type="figure">A</ref> in S1 Text). Recombination between these<lb/> strains will generate hybrid genomes that contain a short fragment from their donor (Fig <ref type="figure">5A</ref>).<lb/> Each of these hybrid strains will originate as a single cell and will not be visible in a mixed sam-<lb/>ple unless they later rise to appreciable frequencies. Such a shift could occur through a single-<lb/>cell bottleneck, e.g., if the hybrid strain is lucky enough to found a new population in naive<lb/> host. Alternatively, if the transferred fragment provides a fitness benefit to the recipient strain, it<lb/> can rapidly increase in frequency within its host and eventually displace its parent. These &quot;gene-<lb/>specific sweeps&quot; will lead to a characteristic depletion of SNVs within the donated region in a<lb/> mixed population sample, while preserving the remaining genetic variation elsewhere along the<lb/> genome (Fig <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). The higher frequencies of the resulting hybrids will make them substantially<lb/> more likely to seed future colonization events in other hosts, suggesting that they could play an<lb/> important role in generating the recombination events we observed in Figs <ref type="figure">2 and 3</ref>.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows an example of this scenario in a longitudinally sampled host who was co-colo-<lb/>nized by a pair of typically diverged B. vulgatus strains (d�1%). We observed a sudden<lb/> depletion of within-host SNVs within a ~20 kb region during the ~6-month interval between<lb/> samples (Fig <ref type="figure">5B and 5C</ref>), while the SNV patterns across the rest of the genome were largely<lb/> preserved. This local depletion of diversity cannot be explained by a large deletion event in one<lb/> of the 2 strains, since the estimated copy number of the recombined region remained close to<lb/> one at both timepoints (Fig <ref type="figure">5C</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">Y</ref> in S1 Text). This region spanned a total of 25 core<lb/> and accessory genes on the reference genome, including a resistance-nodulation-division<lb/> (RND) family efflux pump (<ref type="table">S5</ref> Table and Fig <ref type="figure">EE</ref> in S1 Text); at present, it is not clear which of<lb/> these genes was responsible for driving the sweep, or if the recombined fragment was simply<lb/> hitchhiking alongside a different causative mutation.<lb/></p>

			<p>With limited longitudinal data from co-colonized hosts, it is difficult to find many contem-<lb/>poraneous examples like the one illustrated above. However, we reasoned that the remnants of<lb/> these gene-specific sweeps would still be visible even in metagenomic data from a single time-<lb/>point. Previous work suggests that conspecific strains can coexist within their hosts for years at<lb/> a time <ref type="biblio">[27,70,71]</ref>. Any gene-specific sweeps that occur during this interval will produce an<lb/> extended run of zero SNVs against the backdrop of an otherwise diverse metagenome. We<lb/> identified many such runs of shared ancestry among the co-colonized hosts in our cohort<lb/></p>

		<figure>Fig 5. Signatures of within-host recombination among co-colonizing strains. (A) Schematic illustration of a potential recombination scenario:<lb/> (i) a single host is colonized by a pair of diverged strains; (ii) recombination generates hybrid strains that initially reside at low frequencies; (iii) if a<lb/> hybrid replaces its parent (e.g., due to a selective sweep), it will lead to a depletion of genetic diversity within the transferred region. (B) Within<lb/> host SNVs are identified by aligning metagenomic sequencing reads to the reference genome. The frequencies and coverages of these SNVs can be<lb/> used to identify gene-specific sweeps by hybrid strains (Fig OO in S1 Text). (C) An example of a hybrid sweep in a B. vulgatus population in a<lb/> longitudinally sampled host. Top and bottom parts show metagenomic data collected from the same host at timepoints T 0 (top) and T 1 (bottom);<lb/> Δt~6 mo. In the top panel of each timepoint, solid lines denote the local coverage, estimated from a moving average of the local read depth. In the<lb/> bottom panel of each timepoint, symbols denote the frequencies of within-host SNVs in the highlighted region of panel D (orange arrow), which<lb/> are polarized such that the reference alleles have frequency &gt;0.5 at T 0 ; for comparison, the genome-wide distribution of SNV frequencies is shown<lb/> on the right, illustrating the coexistence between 2 dominant strains at both timepoints (black dotted lines, bar plots). Gray regions denote non-<lb/>core genes. These data show a sudden depletion of SNVs within a ~20 kb region. The consistent coverage around the genome-wide average (gray<lb/> dashed lines) at both timepoints indicates that the depletion of SNVs in the highlighted regions is not caused by large deletion in one of the<lb/> coexisting strains. (D) Tracts of shared ancestry between B. vulgatus strains. Top panels show the spatial distribution of within-host SNVs (green<lb/> vertical lines) and tracts of shared ancetry (white regions of 0 SNV) from the host in (C); orange arrow highlights the putative within-host sweep<lb/> event in (C). For comparison, the bottom 2 panels show analogous distributions computed for pairs of strains from different hosts. In these<lb/> examples, long sharing tracts similar to the within-host sweep in (C) are visible along the genome. (E) Distribution of the longest sharing tract in<lb/> each co-colonized host for 2 example species (Section 4.3 in S1 Text). Gray dashed lines indicate the mean transfer length inferred in Fig 3E. The<lb/> total number of co-colonized samples and the P-value under the one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are shown. The B. vulgatus distribution is<lb/></figure>


			<p>(Section 4.2 in S1 Text), including several other examples in the B. vulgatus population above<lb/> (Fig <ref type="figure">5D</ref>ref>). These runs can extend for thousands of base pairs and are significantly longer than<lb/> we would expect if the mutations were randomly scattered across the genome (P&lt;10 -10 , Fig <ref type="figure">Z</ref><lb/> in S1 Text). This suggests that they could be candidates for previous gene-specific sweeps that<lb/> occurred within the host&apos;s lifetime.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, it is important to distinguish this scenario from older recombination events that<lb/> were inherited by the strains before they colonized their current host (Fig <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). Estimates sug-<lb/>gest that a 10 kb fragment will require hundreds of years on average to accumulate its first<lb/> mutation <ref type="biblio">[72]</ref>, which implies that any given run could be consistent with a broad range of pos-<lb/>sible ages. Consistent with this expectation, we also observed many long runs of shared ances-<lb/>try when comparing strains from unrelated hosts-some of which extended for as long as the<lb/> within-host examples above (Fig <ref type="figure">5D</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">Z</ref> in S1 Text).<lb/></p>

			<p>This suggests that the true signal of within-host recombination must be distinguished from<lb/> this baseline level of sharing. We reasoned that if within-host recombination was prevalent, we<lb/> should still expect to see longer runs of shared ancestry in co-colonizing strains compared to<lb/> random pairs of strains obtained from unrelated hosts. To test this idea, we used the length of<lb/> the longest run as a test statistic, and asked how the distribution of this quantity differed<lb/> between co-colonizing strains of the same species and random pairs of strains selected from<lb/> unrelated hosts.<lb/></p>

			<p>We observed a strong enrichment of long runs in co-colonizing strains of E. rectale (Fig<lb/> <ref type="figure">5E</ref>), which suggests that they were likely caused by previous within-host recombination events<lb/> similar to the B. vulgatus example above. Similar results were obtained when we examined the<lb/> total length of runs that exceeded a given length threshold (Fig <ref type="figure">AA</ref> in S1 Text).<lb/></p>

			<p>In contrast, we found that some of the other species with high rates of recombination across<lb/> hosts (e.g., A. putredinis; Fig <ref type="figure">3C</ref>) did not show any enrichment in within-host sharing (Fig <ref type="figure">AA</ref><lb/> in S1 Text). This negative result could imply that co-colonizing strains recombine less fre-<lb/>quently in these species or that fewer hybrid strains manage to sweep to high frequencies. It<lb/> could also occur if the background levels of between-host sharing are sufficiently frequent that<lb/> they overwhelm any signature of within-host sweeps. This scenario could be particularly rele-<lb/>vant for species like B. vulgatus (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>), in which nearly half of all random strain pairs share<lb/> identical sequences longer than the typical transfer length in Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>. These results show how<lb/> understanding the population genetic patterns between hosts can be important for resolving<lb/> the evolutionary forces within individual host communities.<lb/></p>

			<head>Distribution of shared DNA segments across hosts reveals selection on<lb/> recent transfers<lb/></head>

			<p>The high levels of between-host sharing in species like B. vulgatus raise a natural question:<lb/> Why do random pairs of strains share so many stretches of identical DNA within their core<lb/> genomes? Population genetic theory predicts that such tracts of shared ancestry can emerge<lb/> even in simple neutral scenarios due to the joint action of recombination, mutation, and<lb/> genetic drift <ref type="biblio">[73]</ref>. For a random pair of strains, the expected number of shared fragments lon-<lb/>ger than ℓ scales as � L= �<lb/> d&apos; 2 ð1 þ r=mÞ<lb/> 2 , where �<lb/> d is the average divergence between typical<lb/> pairs of strains (Fig <ref type="figure">CC</ref> in S1 Text; Section 5.1 in S1 Text). The slow decay with ℓ and r implies<lb/> that this number will often be larger than one, even for tracts as long as ℓ~10 kb. This suggests<lb/> that the presence of shared segments alone is not surprising.<lb/></p>

			<figure>not significantly different from its between-host counterpart, while E. rectale displays a significantly higher rate of within-host sharing. The data<lb/> underlying this figure can be found in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10304481.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002472.g005<lb/></figure>

			<p>However, this simple neutral scenario makes strong predictions about how often a given<lb/> region is shared across multiple pairs of strains. To test whether this scenario could recapitu-<lb/>late our data, we scanned across the genome of each species and calculated the probability that<lb/> each position was involved in a long shared segment (&apos; � �<lb/> d &gt; 15, Fig <ref type="figure">6A</ref>, Section 5.2 in S1<lb/> Text). This analysis revealed a systematic variation in the probability of shared segments at dif-<lb/>ferent genomic locations (Fig <ref type="figure">6B-6D</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>An example of this behavior is shown for B. vulgatus in Fig <ref type="figure">6B</ref>. A typical site in the B. vulga-<lb/>tus genome has a 3% chance of being shared in a segment longer than approximately 10 kb.<lb/> However, we observed that many local regions were shared much more frequently than the<lb/> genome-wide average, despite having comparable levels of genetic diversity (Fig <ref type="figure">6B</ref> and Fig<lb/> <ref type="figure">DD</ref> in S1 Text). Some of these peaks are driven by the expansion of a single dominant<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 6. Global distribution of shared DNA segments reveals selection on recent transfers. (A) Schematic of pairwise haplotype sharing metric: For each<lb/> position in the core genome, we compute the fraction of strain pairs from different hosts that have identical genotypes across a window of D&apos; � 1= �<lb/> d<lb/> synonymous sites (Section 5.2 in S1 Text). (B) Observed sharing landscape for B. vulgatus (middle panel); separate comparisons are performed for strains from<lb/> the same clade (blue, Δℓ�1,500 synonymous sites � 10 kb) or different clades (orange, Δℓ�220 synonymous sites � 1.5 kb). The top panel shows the average<lb/> synonymous divergence computed in sliding windows of size Δl = 3,000. These landscapes reveal regions of elevated sharing across hosts (e.g., shaded region)<lb/> that cannot be explained by local reductions in diversity. Red shaded region indicates the within-host recombination event in Fig 5B and 5C. The bottom panel<lb/> shows analogous sharing landscapes from neutral simulations (Section 5.3 in S1 Text), which display more even rates of sharing across the genome. Gray lines<lb/> denote 100 simulation runs with the same parameters, while the blue line highlights 1 typical run. (C) Sharing landscape for E. rectale, computed for pairs of<lb/> strains in different hosts (top) and co-colonizing strains from the same host (bottom). (D) Heterogeneous sharing landscapes across 27 species. Blue points<lb/> show the coefficient of variation of the sharing probability across the genome for all species with sufficient between-host comparisons. B. vulgatus (within<lb/> clade) and E. rectale are highlighted as pink triangles. Gray points show analogous values derived from neutral simulations across a range of parameter values<lb/> (Section 5.3 in S1 Text); each point denotes the mean of 100 simulation runs, while lines show the standard deviation. The data underlying this figure can be<lb/> found in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10304481.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002472.g006<lb/></figure>

			<p>haplotype, while others correspond to multiple distinct haplotypes that are shared by different<lb/> sets of strains (Figs FF and GG in S1 Text). Similar &quot;sharing hotspots&quot; can be observed in other<lb/> prevalent gut species as well (Fig <ref type="figure">6C and 6D</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>This high degree of heterogeneity is inconsistent with simple neutral models of bacterial<lb/> evolution. Simulations show that neutral models generate significantly tighter correlations<lb/> between the average and maximum levels of sharing across the genome (P&lt;10 -8 ; Student&apos;s t<lb/> test; Fig <ref type="figure">6B and 6D</ref> and Fig <ref type="figure">HH</ref> in S1 Text). We also asked whether this heterogeneity could be<lb/> explained by varying recombination rates along the genome <ref type="biblio">[51,74,75]</ref>. However, our simula-<lb/>tions showed that the sharing hot spots in Fig <ref type="figure">6</ref> are qualitatively distinct from traditional<lb/> recombination hot spots. Local increases in the recombination rate actually decreased the<lb/> probability of sharing longer segments (Fig <ref type="figure">II</ref> in S1 Text), since recombination tends to pro-<lb/>duce larger numbers of haplotypes with different combinations of mutations. Consistent with<lb/> this finding, we observe few systematic correlations between the haplotype sharing landscapes<lb/> in Fig <ref type="figure">6</ref> and the recombination hot spots inferred from Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> (Fig <ref type="figure">JJ</ref> in S1 Text).<lb/></p>

			<p>These analyses suggest that the heterogeneous sharing probabilities in Fig <ref type="figure">6B</ref> are likely<lb/> driven by positive selection on fragments that are spreading through the population via recom-<lb/>bination. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the regions with the highest levels of<lb/> sharing are statistically enriched for certain functional genes (e.g., glycosyltransferases) that<lb/> have previously been shown to be under selection in the gut <ref type="biblio">[72]</ref> (Section 5.5 in S1 Text). We<lb/> also found that the sharing landscape qualitatively differs for fragments that are shared within<lb/> versus between the major B. vulgatus clades (Fig <ref type="figure">6B</ref>). This provides further evidence that the<lb/> selection pressures are specific to the identities of the donated and recipient DNA sequences.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, we asked how these global selection pressures were related to the within-host<lb/> sweeps we detected in Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>. For example, we found that the within-host sweep event in Fig <ref type="figure">5C</ref><lb/> occurred within one of the most prominent sharing hotspots in B. vulgatus (Fig <ref type="figure">6B</ref>), which is<lb/> peaked around 3 RND efflux pump genes (Fig <ref type="figure">EE</ref> in S1 Text). This suggests that both events<lb/> were likely driven by a common set of selection pressures. However, this parallelism did not<lb/> arise through selection of the same DNA sequences: while the sweeping haplotype in Fig <ref type="figure">5C<lb/></ref> was also present in a few other hosts in our panel, we found that several other distinct haplo-<lb/>types contributed to the global sharing hotspot at this location (Fig <ref type="figure">FF</ref> in S1 Text). This sug-<lb/>gests that natural selection has promoted the transfer of multiple genetic variants at these loci<lb/> -similar to a soft selective sweep <ref type="biblio">[76]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Even larger differences were observed within the E. rectale populations in Fig <ref type="figure">5E</ref>. In this<lb/> case, while we observed some overlap in the sharing hotspots within versus between hosts, we<lb/> also identified several new hotspots that were only present among co-colonizing strains (Fig<lb/> <ref type="figure">6C</ref>, Fig <ref type="figure">KK</ref> in S1 Text). These significant differences in the locations of the within-host sharing<lb/> events (P&lt;0.001, permutation test; Section 5.4 in S1 Text) provide further evidence that they<lb/> were likely driven by selection on recent transfers within their hosts. More broadly, these<lb/> results show that within-host sweeps are not always local versions of ongoing global sweeps,<lb/> but may reflect distinct and repeatable selection pressures that are specific to the within-host<lb/> environment (e.g., competition-versus colonization-related traits <ref type="biblio">[77]</ref>). Understanding the<lb/> tradeoffs that give rise to these different selection pressures is an interesting topic for future<lb/> work.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>Recombination is a ubiquitous force in bacterial evolution, but dynamics of this process are<lb/> still poorly understood in many natural microbial populations. Here, we sought to quantify<lb/> these dynamics by leveraging the broad range of timescales inherent in the human gut<lb/> microbiome ecosystem. By analyzing recent recombination events within a panel of 29 gut<lb/> commensals, we were able to identify general trends across diverse bacterial species that<lb/> inhabit a common host-associated environment.<lb/></p>

			<p>At a birds-eye view, the rates of recombination we observed across hosts (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>) are compa-<lb/>rable to other bacterial species <ref type="biblio">[25,33,47]</ref> and are consistent with the strong decay in linkage<lb/> disequilibrium that has been observed in global samples of gut bacteria <ref type="biblio">[27,78]</ref>. Across species,<lb/> we found that recombination is responsible for introducing &gt;10-fold as much variation as<lb/> mutation (T mrca /T mosaic ≳10; Fig <ref type="figure">R</ref> in S1 Text), which implies that the genomes of typical cir-<lb/>culating strains are almost completely overwritten by recombination. These values are broadly<lb/> consistent with previous observations in bacterial pathogens, though their different sampling<lb/> strategies can make it difficult to perform detailed numerical comparisons (Fig <ref type="figure">LL</ref> in S1 Text;<lb/> Section 3.10.1 in S1 Text). The observation of such high rates of genetic exchange in commen-<lb/>sal gut bacteria poses challenges for efforts to identify signals of parallel evolution in strains<lb/> sampled from different hosts <ref type="biblio">[72]</ref>, or signals of codiversification across host populations<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[79,80]</ref>, since they imply that individual variants can frequently decouple from the genome-<lb/>wide phylogeny. In this case, more elaborate methods like the haplotype sharing metric in Fig<lb/> <ref type="figure">6</ref> could be useful for resolving common selection pressures across hosts.<lb/></p>

			<p>Although the long-term recombination rates in Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> represent an average over multiple<lb/> host colonization cycles, it is useful to consider their implications when extrapolated down to<lb/> the scale of a single host community. If we assume the recombination events in Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> accumu-<lb/>late largely neutrally (or via neutral hitchhiking <ref type="biblio">[81]</ref>), then the rates implied by these data sug-<lb/>gest that every site in the genome will be involved in more than a thousand recombination<lb/> events within a single day (Section 3.8 in S1 Text). These ballpark estimates suggest that there<lb/> will be numerous opportunities for adaptive mutations to spread between co-colonizing<lb/> strains within a host (e.g., during a fecal microbiota transplant), even if the donor or recipient<lb/> strain is present at a low frequency (e.g., approximately 0.1%). However, since each recombi-<lb/>nation event originates in a single cell, it can still take tens of thousands of generations<lb/> (approximately 5 to 50 years) before a typical ancestral lineage will be involved in a single de<lb/> novo recombination event. The large gap between these timescales can help explain why<lb/> recombination can be an important driver of adaptation in the gut (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>) <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>, while also pre-<lb/>serving the largely clonal structure observed in individual host populations <ref type="biblio">[27,45,70,82]</ref>. We<lb/> emphasize that these extrapolations should be treated with a degree of caution, since they<lb/> assume that most of the recombination events in Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> are effectively neutral. If the vast major-<lb/>ity of these events were locally adaptive, then the true rate of recombination could be smaller<lb/> than the apparent rates in Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> (Section 3.8 in S1 Text).<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to the overall rates, the enhanced resolution of our approach also provided new<lb/> insights into the dynamics of recombination within the gut microbiota. Extending previous<lb/> findings in other bacterial species <ref type="biblio">[28,61,83-85]</ref> (see <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref> for a review), we observed wide-<lb/>spread strain-level variation in recombination rates within many commensal gut species-at<lb/> least some of which could be attributed to existing population structure (e.g., &quot;subspecies&quot; <ref type="biblio">[49]<lb/></ref> or &quot;ecotypes&quot; <ref type="biblio">[86]</ref>). In these handful of examples, the comparative nature of our data set helps<lb/> illuminate the potential causes of this genetic isolation. By comparing the rates and lengths of<lb/> successful transfers in species with different levels of genetic diversity, we obtained new evi-<lb/>dence that the barriers to recombination are likely driven by negative selection on the recom-<lb/>bined fragments (e.g., due to genetic incompatibilities), or related scenarios like incompatible<lb/> restriction-modification systems <ref type="biblio">[65-68]</ref>, rather than passive mechanisms like ecological isola-<lb/>tion or homology-dependent recombination rates (Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Our results suggest that understand-<lb/>ing the causes and extent of these incompatibilities will be important for predicting the genetic<lb/> cohesion and structure of bacterial species.<lb/></p>

			<p>While our underlying approach relied on the presence of closely related strains to resolve<lb/> individual recombination events, the widespread occurrence of these partially recombined<lb/> genomes is still an interesting evolutionary puzzle. We previously showed <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref> that the ecologi-<lb/>cal structure of the human gut microbiome allows us to rule out common sampling biases<lb/> (e.g., microepidemics or clonal blooms) that have been conjectured to play a role in other<lb/> microbial species <ref type="biblio">[21,36,46]</ref>. We also observed considerable variation across different com-<lb/>mensal gut bacteria, with more than a quarter of the species in our panel containing just a<lb/> handful of closely related strains from unrelated hosts. How could the same sample of hosts<lb/> generate such a broad range of closely related strains in different species? The simplest neutral<lb/> models predict a characteristic relationship between the mosaic timescale (T mosaic /T mrca ) and<lb/> the fraction of partially recombined genome pairs in the sample (Fig <ref type="figure">MMB</ref> in S1 Text) <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref>.<lb/> However, we found that the observed fractions are often much higher than this baseline expec-<lb/>tation and show little correlation with the estimated recombination rates (Fig <ref type="figure">MMA</ref> in S1<lb/> Text). This suggests that new evolutionary models will be necessary to understand this puz-<lb/>zling feature of many natural bacterial populations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our results suggest that at least some of the long-term recombination dynamics across<lb/> hosts arise from within-host sweeps of transferred fragments in hosts with multiple co-coloniz-<lb/>ing strains. This could provide a potential mechanism for the strain-level variation in recombi-<lb/>nation rates we observed in many species, since both the colonization structure and propensity<lb/> for sweeps can vary dramatically in different hosts <ref type="biblio">[27,70,82,87]</ref>. It remains unclear whether<lb/> non-sweeping transfers could also play an important role in generating the long-term rates of<lb/> recombination across hosts. Our results highlight the challenges involved in detecting these<lb/> events, since we found that even unrelated strains can frequently share long stretches of DNA<lb/> that are likely spreading through the global population via natural selection. These scenarios<lb/> could potentially be distinguished with denser longitudinal sampling or larger samples of<lb/> clonal isolates (e.g., using single-cell techniques <ref type="biblio">[88]</ref>), which would allow us to distinguish<lb/> between preexisting and in situ transfers <ref type="biblio">[69]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>While our present data do not provide direct information about the underlying mecha-<lb/>nisms of horizontal DNA exchange in these species, our findings impose some interesting con-<lb/>straints on the potential mechanisms that might be involved. Many of the species in our panel<lb/> (e.g., Bacteroides) are not known to be naturally competent <ref type="biblio">[89]</ref>, but still have long-term<lb/> recombination rates that are as high as other species that are (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[47,90]</ref>). Many gut commensals are known to engage in conjugative transfer, both in vitro and<lb/> in vivo <ref type="biblio">[91]</ref>. However, the time required for bacterial conjugation carries a substantial oppor-<lb/>tunity cost in the high growth regimes of the large intestine, and would need to be ameliorated<lb/> by a corresponding fitness benefit or residence in a privileged spatial location <ref type="biblio">[92]</ref>. Moreover,<lb/> we observe little correlation between the overall rates of recombination in different species and<lb/> their frequency of apparent multi-colonization (Fig <ref type="figure">NN</ref> in S1 Text). This suggests that these<lb/> and other mechanisms that require physical proximity between strains are not the major driver<lb/> of the long-term recombination rates we observed across hosts. It is possible that other species<lb/> (e.g., phage or another commensal bacterium in the larger gut community) could serve as<lb/> intermediate vectors for horizontal transfer between strains that are physically segregated in<lb/> different hosts. Such inter-species transfer events have recently been observed within individ-<lb/>ual gut microbiomes <ref type="biblio">[3,11,14]</ref>. It remains to be seen whether the rates of this process are suffi-<lb/>cient to generate the long-term recombination rates we observe within species.<lb/></p>

			<p>An important limitation of our metagenomic approach is that it is primarily restricted to<lb/> recombination events within the core genome. While this provides important information<lb/> about the long-term rates of recombination within gut commensal species, it is possible that<lb/> much of this core-genome hybridization could be driven by positive selection on linked<lb/> accessory genes (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes). Future applications of our methods on grow-<lb/>ing collections of clonal isolates <ref type="biblio">[93]</ref> could shed light on these functional targets of horizontal<lb/> transfer <ref type="biblio">[94]</ref>, and thereby provide a fuller picture of the landscape of bacterial recombination<lb/> within the gut microbiota.</p>
