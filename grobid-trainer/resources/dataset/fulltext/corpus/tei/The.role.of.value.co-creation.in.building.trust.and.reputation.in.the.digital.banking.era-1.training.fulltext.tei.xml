			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Online banking allows customers to conduct more financial operations without going to physical<lb/> branches. customers play a more significant role in developing innovations <ref type="biblio">(thomke &amp; hippel, 2002)</ref>.<lb/> they have skills equal to those of the company&apos;s internal teams <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>.<lb/> Moreover, customers can provide resources beyond purchases and financial contributions, such as knowl-<lb/>edge <ref type="biblio">(harmeling et al., 2017)</ref>. this makes the customer a pivotal actor in the online banking sector that<lb/> must be involved in the strategic process of value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(agrawal &amp; rahman, 2015)</ref>. Value co-creation<lb/> centres on active customer interaction with the company <ref type="biblio">(Vargo &amp; lusch, 2008, 2011, 2016)</ref>. this collab-<lb/>orative interaction creates value by integrating resources, such as customer knowledge and company<lb/> experience, leading to better products and services that are adjusted to customers&apos; needs <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp;<lb/> ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>however, the dematerialized world of the internet could still be a scary place for customers, especially<lb/> regarding people&apos;s savings and financial resources. therefore, studying value co-creation and its relation-<lb/>ships with customer trust and the company&apos;s reputation in an online bank environment is essential for<lb/> several reasons. this may empower banks to build stronger customer relationships, differentiate them-<lb/>selves in a competitive market, and ensure long-term success. Focusing on customer trust is the founda-<lb/>tion of any successful banking relationship, particularly in an online setting where customers may be<lb/> concerned about security and privacy. Value co-creation fosters customer participation, collaboration, and<lb/> resource sharing, all contributing to trust-building between customers and banks. Further, a bank&apos;s rep-<lb/>utation is a crucial asset in the financial industry. Banks can enhance their reputation through value<lb/> co-creation by showcasing their commitment to customer satisfaction, innovation, and responsiveness to<lb/> customer needs <ref type="biblio">(Oklevik et al., 2024)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>although previous studies have the merit of increasing our knowledge of how customer value<lb/> co-creation occurs <ref type="biblio">(kucharska, 2017; syah &amp; Olivia, 2022)</ref>, also in online banking <ref type="biblio">(aldás et al., 2009)</ref>,<lb/> showing how customers&apos; trust in online settings and banks&apos; reputation may be pivotal in customer-bank<lb/> relations as a prerequisite for strategic value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Dhaigude et al., 2023; Mccormack &amp; Deacon,<lb/> 2017)</ref>, only a few studies focus on customers&apos; trust and company reputation as consequences of the<lb/> value co-creation process.<lb/></p>

			<p>trust and company reputation have traditionally been viewed as antecedents that positively influence<lb/> customer value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Mostafa, 2020)</ref>. additionally, some studies have explored the mediating role<lb/> of trust in the context of privacy risk and value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Wang et al., 2020)</ref>. however, our research<lb/> shifts this perspective by demonstrating that effective value co-creation can enhance reputation and<lb/> trust. this, in turn, enables banks to adopt a customer-centric approach, offering tailored solutions and<lb/> fostering long-term relationships grounded in shared values and customer satisfaction <ref type="biblio">(Oklevik et al., 2024)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>We propose that customers&apos; trust and company reputation should be recognized as direct outcomes<lb/> of successful value co-creation strategies in the online banking environment. By embracing this innova-<lb/>tive perspective, our study addresses a critical gap in the literature. By conceptualizing Dart elements<lb/> as drivers, we investigate how these components directly influence trust and company reputation, both<lb/> essential for strategic success in the online banking sector. this novel approach aligns with the Dart<lb/> model&apos;s core principles and provides fresh insights into the intricate relationship between value co-creation<lb/> and its outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>the aims of this study were twofold. First, it tests the Dart model (dialogue, access, risk assessment,<lb/> and transparency) as a driver of customer value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>. second,<lb/> this study investigates trust and reputation as the outcomes of value co-creation in online banking.<lb/> consequently, this study addresses the following research questions: (1) is the effect of dialogue, access,<lb/> risk assessment, and transparency on customer value co-creation significant in the banking industry? (2)<lb/> how is value co-creation related to customer trust and bank reputation?<lb/></p>

			<p>this study uses exploratory factor analysis applying a Principal components analysis and sPss version<lb/> 28 and sMart Pls version 4 software to check the model and evaluate the relationship between the<lb/> factors of the Dart model, value co-creation, company reputation, and customer trust. to do so, data<lb/> were collected through a survey, resulting in 217 valid questionnaires from online bank customers. thus,<lb/> this study makes two contributions. First, it tests the Dart model in the online banking industry and<lb/> shows that the original model also works in the banking industry. second, this study extends the mar-<lb/>keting literature by showing that value co-creation can generate reputation and trust as an outcome.<lb/></p>

			<p>the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. First, a theoretical framework is presented in the<lb/> following sections, and the research hypotheses are developed. subsequently, this paper introduces the<lb/> model&apos;s empirical research methodology, measures, and tests. Finally, the results are presented and dis-<lb/>cussed, along with the theoretical and managerial implications, research limitations, and suggestions for<lb/> future research.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Theoretical background<lb/></head>

			<head>2.1. Strategic value co-creation in the bank industry<lb/></head>

			<p>the value creation process considers the joint efforts of actors in the dyad, actors benefiting themselves<lb/> while interacting and collaborating in the strategic process of value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Vargo &amp; lusch, 2008,<lb/> 2011, 2016)</ref>. the numerous interactions and outcomes of these activities can have a widespread impact<lb/> on the evolution of business strategies <ref type="biblio">(gadde &amp; håkansson, 2011)</ref> because of the participatory role of<lb/> customers collaborating as innovators <ref type="biblio">(amegbe et al., 2023; ramaswamy &amp; Ozcan, 2018)</ref>. this practice<lb/> continues to develop, particularly with new interactive and information technologies. the nature of<lb/> digital interactions, dynamic, synchronous, and changing, calls for special attention to co-creational activ-<lb/>ities and their measurement <ref type="biblio">(royo-Vela &amp; Mariell Velasquez serrano, 2021)</ref>. Value creation is based on<lb/> interaction, and value co-creation is defined as joint activities by actors involved in direct dyadic inter-<lb/>actions <ref type="biblio">(grönroos &amp; ravald, 2011)</ref>. this interaction among actors generates strategic experiences for<lb/> value creation <ref type="biblio">(ramaswamy, 2008; suryadi et al., 2023)</ref>. thus, customers can actively participate in both<lb/> service or product shaping and the perception and creation of value and experience based on the inter-<lb/>action <ref type="biblio">(Vargo &amp; lusch, 2011)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>thus, value creation has changed from a linear process across supply chains to value co-creation, in<lb/> which network actors interact and share resources assisted by digital and interactive technologies<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(royo-Vela &amp; Mariell Velasquez serrano, 2021)</ref>. Digital technologies like it platforms and mobile apps<lb/> allow banks to integrate complementary resources and capabilities and collaborate with customers to<lb/> co-create value <ref type="biblio">(Mefoute Badiang &amp; nkwei, 2024)</ref>. however, many banks aim for innovation as a strategic<lb/> outcome of value co-creation, as they lack innovative capabilities or tools <ref type="biblio">(Ferguson &amp; hlavinka, 2007)</ref>.<lb/> thus, banks must tap into customer creativity and objectivity <ref type="biblio">(Yoo et al., 2010)</ref>. accordingly, direct<lb/> bank-customer interaction is needed to strategically co-create value <ref type="biblio">(andreu et al., 2010)</ref>. additionally,<lb/> banks must implement a customer relationship approach to support strategic value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Payne<lb/> et al., 2008)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>the banking industry uses advanced technology to provide consumers access to products and ser-<lb/>vices <ref type="biblio">(Malar et al., 2019)</ref>. the rise of digital technologies, such as virtual environments, has enabled banks<lb/> to have a closer and quicker relationship with their customers, making physical interactions obsolete<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Martovoy &amp; santos, 2012; royo-Vela et al., 2022)</ref>. Besides technologies, market orientation helps banks<lb/> become closer to their customers <ref type="biblio">(ind &amp; coates, 2013)</ref>. hence, customers are invited to contribute toward<lb/> satisfying their needs. consequently, the relationship between banks and their customers is active, with<lb/> consumers perceiving usefulness when using the provider&apos;s services <ref type="biblio">(grönroos, 2011)</ref>. such dynamics<lb/> animate new customer needs and demands <ref type="biblio">(hosseini et al., 2022)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Furthermore, customers&apos; expectations grow as much as effortlessly accessing the product and service<lb/> information offered by the internet. therefore, another market segment might easily detect an innova-<lb/>tion available in a small market segment <ref type="biblio">(Mainardes et al., 2017)</ref>. another aspect of online banking is<lb/> accessibility to consumers, as depicted by the constant sharing of ideas and value co-creation of new<lb/> tailor-made services strategically created from customers&apos; needs <ref type="biblio">(akter et al., 2020; Oliveira &amp; Von<lb/> hippel, 2011)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>When it comes to the advantages that strategic value co-creation brings to both consumers and<lb/> banks, direct interaction with the bank has a stronger relationship with customers, which, in turn, posi-<lb/>tively affects the bank&apos;s economic performance (e.g. operating cost reduction and higher return of invest-<lb/>ment) <ref type="biblio">(Mainardes et al., 2017)</ref>. in addition to financial performance, direct customer interaction has<lb/> fostered responsiveness to market changes in the banking industry. From the customer perspective, their<lb/> strategic involvement in the value co-creation process brings numerous benefits, such as lower bank<lb/> account charges, more accessible access to credit, and quicker customer care service <ref type="biblio">(Jain &amp; Jain, 2015)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2. The DART model and the role of reputation and customer trust<lb/></head>

			<p>When theorizing the Dart model, <ref type="biblio">Prahalad and ramaswamy (2004a)</ref> focused on the features of strategic<lb/> value co-creation and identified four variables: dialogue, which implies interactivity between the parties;<lb/> access, which promotes dialogue; risk assessment based on firm-customer pairing when deciding to<lb/> co-create; and transparency so that the information between the involved actors is symmetrical. <ref type="biblio">Prahalad<lb/> and ramaswamy (2004a)</ref> highlight the necessity and importance of employing the Dart model for cus-<lb/>tomer strategic value co-creation, including elements characterizing firm-customer collaborative work.<lb/> the Dart model has been used in several sectors and settings. For example, using the Dart model,<lb/> <ref type="biblio">russo spena et al. (2012)</ref> detected an intense exchange of information between customers and compa-<lb/>nies in the pop-up retail industry in italy. <ref type="biblio">ramaswamy (2008)</ref> showed how nike sustained its competitive<lb/> advantages through a value co-creation strategy based on customers&apos; ideas to improve products and<lb/> their feelings when using them. several studies have tested the effectiveness of the Dart model. For<lb/> instance, <ref type="formula">albinsson et al. (2016)</ref> formulated 23 items to measure Dart variables of strategic value<lb/> co-creation. these scholars surveyed 327 participants in two Us business schools and found a statistical<lb/> correlation. Finally, <ref type="biblio">Mazur and Zaborek (2014)</ref> tested the Dart model on 30 indicators with 440 mid-level<lb/> managers from various companies (e.g. food and beverage, cosmetics manufacturing, hotels and accom-<lb/>modation, catering, and other tourism services). nevertheless, to our knowledge, studies have not yet<lb/> tested the Dart model in online banking <ref type="biblio">(Banik &amp; rabbanee, 2023)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, this study included reputation and trust to understand how they relate to the Dart model.<lb/> this study also aims to verify whether reputation and trust are the outcomes of customer value<lb/> co-creation in online banking. this study included reputation because it generates online endorsers<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Madden &amp; smith, 2010)</ref>. however, few studies have directly related to co-creation and reputation.<lb/> Moreover, previous studies have neglected that reputation may occur due to value co-creation, leaving<lb/> a gap in the literature. For example, in <ref type="biblio">Oreg and nov (2008)</ref> study, reputation motivates customers to<lb/> participate in strategic value co-creation because it increases people&apos;s desire to create notoriety and,<lb/> thereby, obtain the approval of others. in addition, a good reputation favours stakeholder engagement,<lb/> which is critical for customer value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(abror et al., 2023; Dandis et al., 2021; nguyen et al.,<lb/> 2022)</ref>. in particular, <ref type="biblio">Oklevik et al. (2024)</ref> explored the intricate relationships between co-creation ele-<lb/>ments and customer engagement within various service industries, including banking. their study<lb/> emphasized the significance of the Dart model as a fundamental component driving brand experience<lb/> strength and satisfaction.<lb/></p>

			<p>customer trust is another factor traditionally studied as an antecedent of value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Dhaigude<lb/> et al., 2023; Mccormack &amp; Deacon, 2017)</ref>. For instance, <ref type="biblio">Pavlou (2003)</ref> considered trust a fundamental<lb/> pillar of consumer behaviour in physical and online purchases. trust in the internet channel includes<lb/> specific attributes between firms and customers, such as perceived benevolence, capacity, competence,<lb/> honesty, integrity, credibility, predictability, and reliability, and other characteristics specific to the online<lb/> environment, such as security and privacy <ref type="biblio">(grabner-kräuter &amp; Faullant, 2008)</ref>. consequently, trust is<lb/> essential in online banking because risk perception is higher online than offline <ref type="biblio">(cheung &amp; lee, 2001)</ref>.<lb/> Furthermore, with internet banking, customers&apos; trust does not physically see the product or the person<lb/> carrying out the transactions. thus, generating trust in online users is vital as there is no personal con-<lb/>tact <ref type="biblio">(Flavián &amp; guinalíu, 2005; lee, 2002)</ref>. in addition, trust pushes internet users to recommend online<lb/> services, which turns trust into a viral marketing tool <ref type="biblio">(li &amp; chen, 2009)</ref>. therefore, trust leads to long-term<lb/> relationships because of emotional bonds <ref type="biblio">(Frau et al., 2023a, 2023b)</ref>. in conclusion, there is broad con-<lb/>sensus in the literature regarding the importance of trust in the value co-creation process. What is still<lb/> under discussion is whether trust is a consequence of value co-creation.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Research framework and hypotheses<lb/></head>

			<p>a key variable explaining customer value co-creation is dialogue, which <ref type="biblio">Prahalad and ramaswamy<lb/> (2004b, p.6)</ref> define as &quot;interactivity, engagement, and propensity to act -on both sides […] it implies<lb/> shared learning and communication between two equal problem solvers.&quot; Dialogue facilitates a two-way<lb/> interaction where firms and customers engage in mutual problem-solving and value creation. <ref type="formula">hoyer<lb/> et al. (2010)</ref> emphasize that dialogue is crucial for creating value and driving innovation. When custom-<lb/>ers are given a voice in the value co-creation strategy, they are more likely to contribute ideas and<lb/> feedback that enhance the value proposition <ref type="biblio">(Vargo &amp; lusch, 2008)</ref>. this participatory approach ensures<lb/> that the solutions developed are closely aligned with customer needs and preferences, leading to higher<lb/> perceived value. Moreover, dialogue fosters a sense of customer ownership and involvement, which is<lb/> essential for value co-creation. <ref type="biblio">Beckers et al. (2018)</ref> suggest that when customers feel heard and valued,<lb/> they are more likely to engage in positive actions on social networks, enhancing brand equity and share-<lb/>holder value. this engagement is critical in social media, where customer interactions can significantly<lb/> influence public perception and brand reputation. While <ref type="biblio">Frau et al. (2018)</ref> acknowledge that interacting<lb/> with customers and other stakeholders might sometimes decrease perceived value due to potential con-<lb/>flicts or misunderstandings, the overall impact of effective dialogue is positive. the Dart model identi-<lb/>fies dialogue as a fundamental element linking consumers to firms, emphasizing that meaningful<lb/> interactions can lead to better mutual understanding and collaboration <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>.<lb/> Furthermore, effective dialogue helps build trust and long-term relationships, which are critical<lb/> components of value co-creation. When companies actively listen to and act on customer feedback, they<lb/> demonstrate commitment and responsiveness, enhancing trust and fostering loyalty <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp;<lb/> ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>. this continuous feedback loop not only improves the immediate value co-creation<lb/> outcomes but also strengthens the foundation for ongoing collaboration and value enhancement.<lb/> therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>H1: Dialogue positively influences the value co-created by customers.<lb/></p>

			<p>the second variable considered in this research model is access, which has been conceptualized as<lb/> the ability of the value co-creation parties to obtain and use &quot;information and tools&quot; <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp;<lb/> ramaswamy, 2004b, p. 7)</ref>. <ref type="biblio">Prahalad and ramaswamy (2004a)</ref> illustrate access to information with custom-<lb/>ers tracking production progress online without going to the factory. also, consumers need access to<lb/> relevant information to participate in production <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>. this information is<lb/> valuable for a better relationship between customers and a company <ref type="biblio">(garbarino &amp; strahilevitz, 2004)</ref>.<lb/> according to sawhney et al. <ref type="biblio">(2005)</ref>, optimizing these tools through investments and technologies con-<lb/>tributes to efficient collaboration because it permits interactivity between the customer and the company.<lb/></p>

			<p>the co-creation process sees the company as an experienced provider for the consumer, which moti-<lb/>vates said consumers to provide relevant information <ref type="biblio">(grönroos &amp; ravald, 2011)</ref>. thus, consumer partic-<lb/>ipation in strategic value co-creation occurs through exchanging information and constructing experiences<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Bolton &amp; saxena-iyer, 2009)</ref>. the association between co-creation and active participation by consumers<lb/> implies more information about the company <ref type="biblio">(cova &amp; Dalli, 2009)</ref>. the disclosure of information by cus-<lb/>tomers leads to a better understanding of their relationships with the company <ref type="biblio">(Moon et al., 2019)</ref>. By<lb/> contrast, practices denying access to knowledge and information or disabling their exploitation may hin-<lb/>der strategic value co-creation (cabiddu et al., 2019). Based on these previous studies, the following<lb/> hypothesis was proposed:<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>H2: access to information positively influences the value co-created by customers.<lb/></p>

			<p>the model considered risk assessment as the third variable, which refers to evaluating &quot;the proba-<lb/>bility of harm to the customer&quot; <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004b, p. 7)</ref>. risk plays a significant role in<lb/> consumer behaviour, influencing information search and purchase decision-making <ref type="biblio">(Masoud, 2013)</ref>.<lb/> Despite recognizing the benefits of using the internet, consumers often feel uncertain about online<lb/> transactions, perceiving them as risky <ref type="biblio">(lee &amp; tan, 2003)</ref>. Perceived risk in online buying is defined as<lb/> the potential loss in pursuing a desired result, combining uncertainty and the possibility of severe<lb/> consequences <ref type="biblio">(ko et al., 2004)</ref>. this concept has been extensively studied, with various scales devel-<lb/>oped to measure perceived danger <ref type="biblio">(Featherman &amp; hajli, 2016)</ref>. high levels of perceived risk can sig-<lb/>nificantly reduce consumers&apos; willingness to purchase products online <ref type="biblio">(Barnes et al., 2007)</ref>. in online<lb/> commerce, perceived risk negatively impacts purchasing behaviour, attitudes towards usage, and the<lb/> intention to adopt online platforms <ref type="biblio">(Zhou et al., 2008)</ref>. Without a physical environment, customers<lb/> cannot directly assess product quality, engage in personal interactions, and feel secure about payment<lb/> processes. additionally, they face the costs of learning how to navigate online systems <ref type="biblio">(Jain &amp; Jain,<lb/> 2015)</ref>. these factors contribute to the perception of online commerce as risky for some customers.<lb/> conversely, other consumers appreciate online commerce&apos;s advantages, such as real-time information<lb/> availability for product and price comparisons <ref type="biblio">(san Martín &amp; camarero, 2009)</ref>. <ref type="biblio">Featherman and hajli<lb/> (2016)</ref> highlight that consumers are more concerned about perceived risks than usability when con-<lb/>tracting services online. this heightened concern about risk over usability indicates that risk assess-<lb/>ment is critical in shaping consumer behaviour in online environments. When consumers perceive high<lb/> levels of risk, they are less likely to engage in value co-creation activities, as their focus shifts towards<lb/> mitigating potential adverse outcomes rather than collaborating and innovating with firms. therefore,<lb/> practical risk assessment and mitigation are crucial for fostering value co-creation online. companies<lb/> must implement robust risk management strategies to alleviate customers&apos; concerns, enhancing their<lb/> willingness to participate in value co-creation processes. these strategies include ensuring secure pay-<lb/>ment systems, providing transparent information about products and services, and offering reliable<lb/> customer support. the literature indicates that perceived risk negatively influences consumer behaviour<lb/> and attitudes in online commerce. given the importance of risk assessment in shaping these percep-<lb/>tions, we propose the following hypothesis:<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>H3: risk assessment negatively influences the co-creation of value by customers.<lb/></p>

			<p>transparency has been conceptualized as the result of symmetric information-sharing processes<lb/> between customers and firms involved in strategic value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>.<lb/> this concept emphasizes the importance of open and honest communication, where both parties<lb/> exchange information with equal clarity and accessibility. <ref type="biblio">Ballantyne and Varey (2006)</ref> argue that custom-<lb/>ers require a degree of fair reciprocity in their dialogue with companies, meaning that the information<lb/> shared with consumers must be as clear and understandable as what they share with the organization.<lb/> this reciprocity builds trust and fosters a collaborative environment, which is essential for effective value<lb/> co-creation. consequently, companies can no longer operate with opaque pricing and profit margins<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp; ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>. instead, they must ensure that information is accessible and transpar-<lb/>ent, providing customers with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions. <ref type="formula">garbarino and<lb/> strahilevitz (2004)</ref> highlight that information transparency offers a competitive advantage to companies,<lb/> as it enhances customer trust and engagement. customers who perceive that a company is transparent<lb/> are more likely to feel confident in their interactions and transactions. this confidence encourages greater<lb/> participation in co-creation activities, as customers are assured that their contributions are valued and<lb/> that they clearly understand the processes involved. transparency not only facilitates participation but<lb/> also enables continuous feedback. Open information channels allow customers to provide feedback on<lb/> products and services, which companies can use to make improvements and innovations. this ongoing<lb/> feedback loop enhances value co-creation by ensuring that the products and services align with cus-<lb/>tomer needs and preferences. Furthermore, transparency in information-sharing helps mitigate uncertain-<lb/>ties and reduces perceived risks associated with online transactions. When customers have clear and<lb/> accurate information about products, services, and company practices, they are less likely to perceive<lb/> high levels of risk, promoting a positive co-creation experience <ref type="biblio">(Masoud, 2013)</ref>. this reduced perceived<lb/> risk is crucial for fostering an environment where customers feel comfortable engaging in value<lb/> co-creation activities. transparency is vital in strategic value co-creation by promoting open communica-<lb/>tion, building trust, enabling continuous feedback, and reducing perceived risks. these elements are<lb/> essential for creating a collaborative environment where customers feel empowered to contribute to the<lb/> value co-creation process. therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>H4: transparency positively influences the value co-created by customers.<lb/></p>

			<p>considering the significance of reputation in the banking industry, it is crucial to explore the factors<lb/> influencing a company&apos;s reputation, including value co-creation. Value co-creation, as proposed by <ref type="biblio">Vargo<lb/> and lusch (2008, 2011, 2016)</ref>, is centred on active customer interaction with the company. this collabo-<lb/>rative interaction creates value, such as a reputation and personalized customer experiences <ref type="biblio">(Prahalad &amp;<lb/> ramaswamy, 2004a)</ref>. From this perspective, it is worth investigating whether the value co-creation pro-<lb/>cess between retail banks and their customers contributes to a more robust company reputation.<lb/> traditionally, company reputation has been studied as a determinant of value co-creation. scholars have<lb/> focused on examining the effective management of customer relationships, which results in a long-term<lb/> competitive advantage in the long term <ref type="biblio">(nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>conversely, pursuing a high company reputation may require increased investments in new it solu-<lb/>tions to maintain a competitive edge, potentially affecting short-term profits and hindering the economic<lb/> value generation from assets <ref type="biblio">(eccles et al., 2007; nguyen et al., 2022)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>consequently, a recent line of literature has shifted its perspective to analyzing value co-creation as<lb/> an antecedent of company reputation <ref type="biblio">(Martillo Jeremías &amp; Polo Peña, 2021)</ref>. For instance, recent studies<lb/> have demonstrated that customer value co-creation positively impacts a company&apos;s reputation by foster-<lb/>ing a customer-centric organizational culture and delivering enhanced customer experience <ref type="biblio">(Foroudi<lb/> et al., 2019)</ref>. a company&apos;s reputation is further solidified by fulfilling promises to stakeholders and meet-<lb/>ing their expectations <ref type="biblio">(Ponzi et al., 2011)</ref>. through customer value co-creation, companies can exhibit<lb/> their dedication to delivering value to customers and stakeholders, strengthening their reputation as<lb/> customer-centric and responsible organizations <ref type="biblio">(Martillo Jeremías &amp; Polo Peña, 2021)</ref>. Ultimately,<lb/> co-creation initiatives empower customers to actively participate in the value-creation process, enabling<lb/> companies to tailor their offerings to meet specific customer needs and preferences, thus improving their<lb/> reputation <ref type="biblio">(Pera et al., 2016)</ref>. however, despite the importance of identifying antecedent variables of<lb/> reputation, such as value co-creation, a gap exists in the literature regarding how value co-creation pos-<lb/>itively influences banks&apos; company reputation. Based on these studies, the following hypothesis was<lb/> proposed:<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>H5: customer value co-created is positively related to company reputation.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>customer trust, a fundamental belief in the dependability, honesty, or competence of a person or<lb/> entity, emerges as a crucial emotion resulting from the interaction between banks and their customers<lb/> during the value-formation process <ref type="biblio">(Frau et al., 2023a, 2023b)</ref>. customers trust service providers when<lb/> they are assured that their sensitive information remains secure <ref type="biblio">(Parasuraman et al., 1985)</ref>. to establish<lb/> trust, companies must commit to matters relevant to the customers&apos; value co-creation process and then<lb/> fulfil those commitments <ref type="biblio">(Yap et al., 2010)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>research indicates that higher customer co-creation increases trust between companies and their cus-<lb/>tomers <ref type="biblio">(lundkvist &amp; Yakhlef, 2004)</ref>. scholars support this view by suggesting that value co-creation sig-<lb/>nificantly influences trust because it helps mitigate risks arising from open information exchanges<lb/> between partners <ref type="biblio">(ayuni &amp; engriani, 2019)</ref>. companies create connections between their employees and<lb/> customers through value co-creation and work together in harmony. this involves not only listening to<lb/> customers but also taking action based on their suggestions <ref type="biblio">(lundkvist &amp; Yakhlef, 2004)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>a crucial aspect of value co-creation is communication between the parties involved, serving as a<lb/> platform for developing a shared understanding and exchanging knowledge related to each other&apos;s<lb/> activities, generating mutual trust <ref type="biblio">(lundkvist &amp; Yakhlef, 2004)</ref>. Based on these findings, the last hypoth-<lb/>esis of this study is as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>H6: customer value co-creation is positively related to trust.<lb/></p>

			<p>From the analyzed literature and the six suggested hypotheses, we propose the following model of<lb/> online banking customers&apos; value co-creation towards reputation and trust development (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>the population must be consistent with the proposed study&apos;s objectives to ensure the research&apos;s effec-<lb/>tiveness. in the research context, the population is not finite, it is challenging to quantify, and it has over<lb/> 100,000 units. it consists of customers who regularly use online banking services and have a stable<lb/> relationship with an important spanish bank, caixa Bank. 1 . the primary reasons for selecting this bank<lb/> include the proprietary nature of the information, the specific strategic initiatives of this bank in the<lb/> realm of value co-creation, and the depth of data we could access. this bank&apos;s unique practices provided<lb/> a rich context for addressing our research questions in detail. the respondents&apos; knowledge level limits<lb/> this sampling frame regarding the organization and the tools available for value co-creation. the survey<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. Conceptual model: towards the reputation and trust development.<lb/></figure>

			<p>was sent to all private customers of an important bank outlet in Valencia, spain&apos;s third most populated<lb/> city, who appeared in its database whenever they used online banking services. ethical approval was<lb/> obtained from the University of Valencia ethics committee for the study. 243 clients answered the ques-<lb/>tionnaire, of which 26 were discarded because of incorrect responses. Written informed consent for par-<lb/>ticipation in the study has been obtained. therefore, the final sample of 217 clients is not probabilistic,<lb/> although big enough to be proportional, as well as representative of the outlet&apos;s customers, as it meets<lb/> the criteria and weight of gender, age, educational level, income, and employment situation of the bank&apos;s<lb/> clients (see table <ref type="table">1</ref>). therefore, the sample was understood as non-probability judgmental sampling<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(etikan &amp; Bala, 2017)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>to determine whether this sample size was sufficient for the study&apos;s objectives, both chin&apos;s (1989)<lb/> minimum sample size criteria and the results of the applied power test using gPower 3.1, described later<lb/> in the section, confirmed a sufficient sample size. Data were collected through online questionnaires sent<lb/> to mobile phones during February and May 2022 and June-July 2023.<lb/></p>

			<p>the key respondents were 62.08% males and 37.92% females. respondents were under the age of<lb/> sixty-five, and most of them were between 26 and 55 years old. in addition, most respondents had a<lb/> university degree or higher (77.43%). three-quarters of the sample is actively working. regarding average<lb/> income, 40.20% of those surveyed were within the range of 24,001-48,000 euros (see table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2. Measurement scales<lb/></head>

			<p>the survey included measures of the key constructs of the Dart model: dialogue, access, risk assess-<lb/>ment, and transparency. these form the second-order construct of value co-creation. a repeated indica-<lb/>tor procedure was applied <ref type="biblio">(lohmöller, 1989)</ref>. in addition, the survey comprised measurements of the<lb/> dependent constructs of trust and company reputation. each construct was measured with multiple<lb/> items using a five-point likert scale with anchors for all items (see tables 2-4). the questionnaire was<lb/> tested using a two-step process. First, two academics with more than 20 years of experience in academic<lb/> research conducted a semantic review of the questionnaire. they identified sentences that might confuse<lb/> or tax respondents&apos; patience. second, a convenience sample of 20 bank customers completed the ques-<lb/>tionnaire. they pinpointed all unclear, illogical, or problematic sentences to respond to.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3. Exploratory factor analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>to identify the underlying structure of the dimensions, we performed an exploratory factor analysis by<lb/> applying a principal component analysis using sPss version 28. We subsequently checked the model<lb/> using the sMart Pls version 4 software <ref type="biblio">(hair et al., 2019; ringle et al., 2022)</ref>. We used partial least<lb/> squares (Pls) for two reasons. First, this study mainly aims to analyze the predictive capacity of a model<lb/> composed of two dependent constructs (company reputation and company trust) and maximize their<lb/> explained variance by one predictive variable: value co-creation, a second-order construct formed by the<lb/> variables dialogue, access to information, risk assessment, and transparency). second, a small sample size<lb/> was available, although it was sufficient.<lb/></p>

			<p>Factor analysis showed an adequate and clear underlying factor structure that identified five factors<lb/> with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, which accounted for 77.16% of the variance. Oblimin rotation was<lb/> selected because the factors are not independent, and some correlation exists between them. Bartlett&apos;s<lb/> test of sphericity was statistically significant (χ2 = 5381,26; p &lt; 0.001), and the kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure<lb/></p>

			<p>of sampling adequacy was 0.89, exceeding the minimum threshold of 0.50, as proposed by <ref type="biblio">kaiser (1974)</ref>.<lb/> Before applying Pca, some items from the scales were dropped because the reliability and quantity of<lb/> items matter. in the Dialogue scale, items 3, 5, 6, and 7 were dropped; in the risk scale, item 3 and the<lb/> transparency scale, item 4 were also dropped. the composition of the components is shown in table <ref type="table">4</ref>.<lb/> as seen in table 4, the three items in the trust scale do not compose an individual factor because they<lb/> weigh in three other factors: accessibility, transparency and reputation. therefore, the access to informa-<lb/>tion factor is composed of four items, including trU1, which is composed of five items; the reputation<lb/> factor is composed of six items, including trU3; the risk factor is formed of five items, and four items,<lb/> including trU2, form the transparency.<lb/> this structure changes the previous conceptual model structure shown in Figures <ref type="figure">1 and 2</ref>. now, the<lb/> latent variables&apos; access to information, Dialogue, risk and transparency measure the second-order con-<lb/>struct Value co-creation (VacOcre), and the latter affects reputation (see Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4. Reliability and validity of the measurement instrument<lb/></head>

			<p>Depending on the number of relations that need to be evaluated, an initial concern relates to the sam-<lb/>ple size. according to chin (1998), the overall sample size must be ten times the largest of the two<lb/> possibilities: (1) the factor that has the largest number of indicators or (2) the dependent factor that is<lb/> affected by the largest number of independent factors. in our model, the first possibility was equal to<lb/> six (reputation and trust), while the second was equal to four (the number of factors directly forming<lb/> value co-creation). accordingly, the minimum sample size was 60, and the sample included 217 cases.<lb/> additionally, we calculated the test power for the dependent variable (r2) for one predictor (α= .01, and<lb/> a low effect size (0.10). the minimum level for the social sciences is 0.8. the result showed a test power<lb/> (1-β) of over 0.97 for a sample size of 217 (df = 215; 1-β = 0.979).<lb/> </p>

For ca and<lb/> cr, all scores were over 0.84, higher than the minimum threshold of 0.7 <ref type="biblio">(Bagozzi &amp; Yi, 1988; nunnally &amp;<lb/> Bernstein, 1994)</ref>.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>to evaluate convergent validity, a bootstrap test was conducted over 5,000 resamples, with no sign<lb/> of change in resampling. We then compared the results with sign changes at the construct level and<lb/> individual changes. We used the one-tailed test with a significance level of 0.05. as can be seen in table<lb/> 5, all items loaded above 0.7 in terms of their respective reflective constructs <ref type="biblio">(hair et al., 2014)</ref>. convergent<lb/> validity within the reflective constructs was assessed using average variance extracted (aVe). the results<lb/> showed scores higher than the minimum threshold of 0.5 suggested by <ref type="biblio">Bagozzi and Yi (1988)</ref> and hair<lb/> et al. <ref type="biblio">(2012)</ref> (see table <ref type="table">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>between the latent variables. as shown in table 6, this criterion was met by the data. in addition, we<lb/> ran the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (htMt) to test discriminant validity <ref type="biblio">(henseler et al., 2015)</ref>. all the<lb/> htMt ratios in absolute value were below the threshold of 0.90, even below 0.85, which indicated that<lb/> discriminant validity exists between the reflective factors (see table <ref type="table">6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>these results indicate satisfactory reliability and convergent and discriminant validity of the measure-<lb/>ment model&apos;s variables and constructs.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Results<lb/></head>

			<p>to assess the structural model, we observed the dependent latent variable variance, explained by the<lb/> predictive factor. the criterion to apply is r 2 , which must be higher than 0.1 <ref type="biblio">(Falk &amp; Miller, 1992)</ref>. in<lb/> addition to r 2 , we checked the significance of the path coefficients using their respective t-values <ref type="biblio">(hair<lb/> et al., 2012)</ref>. Finally, we assessed the cross-validated redundancy index (Q 2 ) by blindfolding <ref type="biblio">(geisser,<lb/> 1975)</ref>, which, together with r 2 , informed on the predictive capacity of endogenous factors, with values<lb/> above zero, indicated a clear predictive relevance of the model (chin, 1998; see table <ref type="table">6</ref>). the ViF indica-<lb/>tor for the inner model is less than five and higher than 0.20, which is the recommended range accord-<lb/>ing to <ref type="biblio">hair et al. (2011)</ref>. specifically, the ViF for the independent constructs is 1.496 (accinF), 1.768<lb/> (DialOgUe), 2.645 (risk), and 1.970 (transParencY); all values are less than 3, which is ideal, according<lb/> to <ref type="biblio">hair et al. (2019)</ref>. therefore, collinearity between the independent constructs was not observed.<lb/></p>

			<p>the empirical results support four hypotheses about customer value co-creation and one about the<lb/> effects of value co-creation on company reputation and trust (see Figure <ref type="figure">3 and table 7</ref>). the first four<lb/> hypotheses are as follows: h1 (β = 0.291; p &lt; 0.001) shows that dialogue significantly and positively influ-<lb/>ences customer value co-creation. the same is true for h2, where access to information significantly and<lb/> positively explains customer value co-creation (β = 0.230; p &lt; 0.001). in the case of h3, risk assessment,<lb/> insofar as it implies information to be able to assess the risk of the financial service product adequately,<lb/> positively influences value co-creation (β = -0.394; p &lt; 0.001), with the variable having the highest effect<lb/> on value co-creation. h4 shows transparency positively affects customer value co-creation (β = 0.301;<lb/> p &lt; 0.001). Finally, regarding h5, the results show that value co-creation affects reputation and trust in a<lb/> company (β = 0.769; p &lt; 0.001).<lb/></p>

			<p>regarding the proposed model and its predictive capacity, both r2, with a value of 0.591 and a Q2<lb/> of 0.580, show an explicit model predictive capacity. these results support that customer value co-creation<lb/> in the banking sector has a relevant impact on a company&apos;s reputation and trust development.<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>studying dialogue, access to information, risk assessment, transparency, customer trust, and bank repu-<lb/>tation is critical to understanding customer value co-creation in the bank setting. such factors are espe-<lb/>cially paramount nowadays because customers can see bank operations in real time and have access to<lb/> a personal manager through their mobile devices.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1. Theoretical implications<lb/></head>

			<p>regarding the research questions, this study makes two key contributions to the test and extant theory<lb/> on customer strategic value co-creation in the banking context.<lb/></p>

			<p>First, when conceptualizing the Dart model, Prahalad and ramaswamy (2004a) considered dialogue,<lb/> access, risk assessment, and transparency as the fundamental pillars that allow the customer to co-create<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Table 6.

			<p>strategic value with the company, keeping open the opportunity to further studies enriching their model<lb/> with additional and industry-specific variables. this study attempts to extend the Dart model by involv-<lb/>ing two significant strategic variables for customer value co-creation in the online banking industry: trust<lb/> and reputation. the findings reveal that value co-creation significantly affects a company&apos;s reputation<lb/> and trust. therefore, this study supports the notion that the customer value co-creation process can<lb/> develop a company&apos;s reputation and trust. Previous research has contributed in various ways to our<lb/> understanding of customer value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(kucharska, 2017; syah &amp; Olivia, 2022)</ref> and online banking<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(aldás et al., 2009)</ref>. For instance, it highlights the significance of customers&apos; trust in online settings and<lb/> banks&apos; reputations as essential prerequisites for strategic value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Dhaigude et al., 2023;<lb/> Mccormack &amp; Deacon, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="biblio">Oklevik et al. (2024)</ref> also underscored the importance of the Dart model<lb/> elements in enhancing customer-brand interactions, providing a foundational understanding that further<lb/> supports the role of trust and reputation as outcomes of value co-creation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Furthermore, studies have shown that trust and company reputation are antecedents that positively<lb/> influence customer value co-creation (e.g. Mostafa, 2020). additionally, researchers have explored how<lb/> trust mediates relationships with factors such as privacy risk, concern, and value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Wang et al.,<lb/> 2020)</ref>. in contrast, our study extends the existing literature by demonstrating that constructive and col-<lb/>laborative relationships, along with resource integration, arise from the positive management of dia-<lb/>logue, access to information, risk assessment, and transparency between the bank and customers during<lb/> the value co-creation process. these factors foster long-term relationships and build customer trust and<lb/> reputation. consequently, customers&apos; trust and company reputation can be seen as direct outcomes of a<lb/> successful value co-creation strategy in online banking.<lb/></p>

			<p>in conclusion, building upon the original Dart model and existing research on the relationships<lb/> between customer trust, company reputation, and customer value co-creation, this article contributes to<lb/> the strategic marketing literature by highlighting that the value co-creation process can yield reputation<lb/> and trust as outcomes. traditionally, trust and company reputation have been seen as antecedents that<lb/> positively impact customer value co-creation <ref type="biblio">(Mostafa, 2020)</ref>. Our research, however, shifts this perspec-<lb/>tive by showing that effective value co-creation can enhance reputation and trust. consequently, we<lb/> propose that customers&apos; trust and company reputation should be recognized as direct outcomes of suc-<lb/>cessful value co-creation strategies in online banking. By adopting this innovative approach, our findings<lb/> offer fresh insights into the complex relationship between value co-creation and its outcomes.<lb/></p>

			<p>second, the Dart model has been studied in several settings. For example, the Dart model has been<lb/> employed in the pop-up retail sector in italy <ref type="biblio">(russo spena et al., 2012)</ref> and the fashion industry, showing<lb/> how nike co-created strategic value with customers <ref type="biblio">(ramaswamy, 2008)</ref>. however, there is a lack of<lb/> studies that employ the Dart model in banks <ref type="biblio">(Banik &amp; rabbanee, 2023)</ref>, especially in the online banking<lb/> setting. therefore, this study suggests four hypotheses for testing the Dart model in an online bank<lb/> setting. hypotheses involving dialogue, access to information, risk assessment, and transparency are<lb/> accepted. thus, the present study&apos;s findings show that the Dart model works successfully in the online<lb/> banking industry. this result extends the current literature that tested the Dart model in an offline<lb/> context (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Banik &amp; rabbanee, 2023)</ref>. therefore, this study provides a broader vision of the Dart model,<lb/> including banks&apos; online customers.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.2. Management implications<lb/></head>

			<p>Vale co-creation is pivotal to online banking. therefore, this study provides managerial and strategic<lb/> suggestions for each variable involved in the Drat model: customer trust and bank reputation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Dialogues require active attitudes from both customers and banks. From the banks&apos; point of view, as<lb/> a minimum requirement, they must inform customers about products and services at the time of their<lb/> launch. however, a more advanced practice requires banks to encourage customers to participate in the<lb/> product innovation process, clearly informing them of their role in innovation and their benefits. this will<lb/> efficiently impact customers&apos; co-creation engagement and increase value.<lb/></p>

			<p>access refers to tools and information that facilitate collaboration in strategic value co-creation. For<lb/> this reason, banks must provide sufficient means for customers to facilitate collaboration. For example,<lb/> banks may invest in digital platforms to allow customers to collaborate remotely in the innovation pro-<lb/>cess without going to the bank&apos;s office. in addition, banks may develop procedures to allow customers<lb/> to collaborate whenever they want.<lb/></p>

			<p>risk assessment is based on identifying, analyzing, and controlling unforeseen events that may arise<lb/> when co-creating. therefore, banks must identify what customers recognize as risky in collaboration.<lb/> Banks need to take action to resolve each customer-perceived unsafe aspect of the collaboration and<lb/> quantify the possibility that unforeseen events occur and their impact on co-creation. Banks may also be<lb/> proactive in quantifying the possibility of unforeseen risky events to guarantee a smooth value co-creation<lb/> strategic process with customers.<lb/></p>

			<p>transparency, which refers to information equality between the customer and company, occurs when<lb/> banks strategically communicate the value they aim to gain in the collaborative process. this also means<lb/> being open to consumer criticism, which requires negotiation. thus, banks must be ready to be asked<lb/> and share collaboration and project development data.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, dialogue, access, risk assessment, and transparency are crucial in promoting online value<lb/> co-creation. additionally, marketing planners must consider that successfully managing the value<lb/> co-creation process results in greater customer trust and bank reputation. thus, developing reliability<lb/> policies based on best collaboration practices and banks&apos; ability to place customers in the centre of value<lb/> co-creation processes increases bank reputation and customer trust.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.3. Limitations and future lines of research<lb/></head>

			<p>this study shows findings from an underexplored perspective of online-back customers. While it demon-<lb/>strates the key role that Dart variables play in customer value co-creation and how it results in cus-<lb/>tomer trust and bank reputation, it also has a few limitations.<lb/></p>

			<p>this study was based on homogeneous survey respondents. For example, data collection is based<lb/> on customers from only one bank, caixa Bank, and only one country, spain. We acknowledge that<lb/> collecting data from a single bank limits the generalizability of our findings. We discuss the potential<lb/> biases introduced by this approach. this enhanced discussion aims to give readers a clearer under-<lb/>standing of the study&apos;s boundaries and encourage future research to build upon our findings with a<lb/> broader dataset.</p>
