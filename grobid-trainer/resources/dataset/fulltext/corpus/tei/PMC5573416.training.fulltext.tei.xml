			<p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the pulmonary disease, tuberculosis (TB), is considered<lb/> to be the world&apos;s most successful pathogen <ref type="biblio">1</ref> . According to a WHO survey in 2015 <ref type="biblio">2</ref> , Mtb was shown to be respon-<lb/>sible for 10.4 million new cases of TB, which included 480,000 new cases of multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB, with<lb/> an estimated 1.8 million deaths and 400,000 deaths resulting from co-infection with HIV. In 2015, the United<lb/> Nations adopted the objective to end the global TB epidemic by 2030 <ref type="biblio">2</ref> . To achieve this goal, there is an urgent<lb/> requirement to develop new diagnostics, vaccines and treatment regimens.<lb/></p>

			<p>To limit the potential for resistance, TB therapy has, for decades, used a 4-drug cocktail consisting of isoni-<lb/>azid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide and ethambutol, which inhibit a diverse set of essential metabolic<lb/> nodes <ref type="biblio">3-6</ref> . Nonetheless, strains with dual resistance to INH and RIF (classed as multi-drug resistant), and more<lb/> extensively against fluoroquinolones and injectable second-line drugs, are on the rise. Clearly, an effective strategy<lb/> to counter resistance has to include not just novel compounds, but perhaps more importantly targets that have not<lb/> yet been subjected to selective pressure by antibiotics.<lb/></p>

			<p>In recent years, TB drug discovery has been dominated by whole cell phenotypic high throughput screening<lb/> (HTS) campaigns of extensive compound libraries against Mtb <ref type="biblio">7, 8</ref> . In 2013, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) published a<lb/> collection of 177 non-cytotoxic compounds, known as the &apos;TB box set&apos; , with activity against Mtb H37Rv <ref type="biblio">7</ref> . This<lb/> set has been extended to include a total of 227 compounds <ref type="biblio">8</ref> and has led to a broad effort of target assignment.<lb/> However, to progress these hit compounds to leads and clinical candidates, target validation is crucial, enabling<lb/> optimization of chemical scaffolds by medicinal chemistry efforts. Target assignment also offers the potential<lb/> to discover novel drug targets, which can be exploited in inhibitor design. In this work, we have recognized the<lb/> potential of an exciting novel anti-tubercular drug target, tryptophan synthase, which catalyzes the final step in<lb/> tryptophan biosynthesis. Tryptophan is classified as an essential amino acid in humans and must be acquired<lb/> through the diet. This requirement alleviates the concern of common targets within humans. Here, we describe<lb/> the target identification and hit optimization for compounds 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), and have characterized their<lb/> interaction with the target tryptophan synthase. Finally, the target assignment of the tryptophan synthase high-<lb/>lights the plausibility of amino acid biosynthesis pathways as suitable and underexploited Mtb drug targets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Identification of sulfolanes and indoline-5-sulfonamides as anti-TB hits. GSK continuously<lb/> screens the new chemical diversity in its compound collection in search for new hits with anti-tubercular poten-<lb/>tial. As part of these efforts, we have recently identified two new chemical scaffolds with in vitro activity against<lb/> Mtb: sulfolanes, represented by compound 1 and indoline-5-sulfonamides, represented by compounds 2 and<lb/> 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The in vitro profile of these compounds is shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. All three compounds have good poten-<lb/>cies against Mtb. Importantly, the compounds do not show cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells up to 50-100 µM.<lb/> Lipophilicity is in the desired range (cLogP varies between 1.63 and 2.05) while Property Forecast Index (PFI),<lb/> that has shown a great potential to predict drug developability <ref type="biblio">9</ref> , is slightly high for compound 3. This fact, together<lb/> with the considerable planarity of the molecule, may explain its poor solubility. The other representative of the<lb/> indoline-5-sulfonamide series (2) exhibits enhanced solubility but low stability in the presence of not only mouse<lb/> but also human microsomal fraction. Disappointingly, medicinal chemistry optimization and structure-activity<lb/> relationship (SAR) explored around the initial hits (compounds 2 and 3) was found to be very limited and after a<lb/> significant number of analogues had been synthesized and evaluated, the series was abandoned.<lb/></p>

			<p>The overall profile of the sulfolane 1 is very encouraging. Additional chemical space around the active com-<lb/>pounds in the sulfolane series, allowed further optimization, which is exemplified by compounds 4 and 5. For<lb/> instance, compound 4 presents a reasonable compound with in vitro activity and high metabolic stability, and it<lb/> is therefore suitable for oral in vivo efficacy studies. We also decided to progress compound 5, due to its enhanced<lb/> potency. However, in this case we used a subcutaneous administration to avoid first pass metabolism and mitigate<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref> shows the results obtained when the efficacy of both compounds was measured in an acute infection<lb/> assay in C57BL/6 mice. Compound 4 (oral, 100-500 mg/Kg) proved to be efficacious and a dose/response curve<lb/> was obtained. At the maximum dose evaluated, 350 mg/Kg (the mouse dosed at 500 mg/Kg had to be withdrawn<lb/> due to adverse effects), a reduction of 1.4 log colony forming units (CFU) was observed when compared with<lb/> untreated mice. In the same study and despite its higher in vitro potency, compound 5 did not show a statistically<lb/> significant response. Blood samples were taken from the mice used in the efficacy experiment to quantify the<lb/> concentration of compounds 4 and 5. The data is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>. Although the number of time points was<lb/> limited and accurate pharmacokinetic parameters cannot be calculated, a significant maximum concentration<lb/> and exposure of both compounds was evident. The reason for the lack of efficacy of compound 5 is still unknown.<lb/> A major difference in distribution to the lungs between compounds 4 and 5 is not expected considering their<lb/> structural similarity. The lower half-life of compound 5 could help explain its inactivity in vivo if the minimum<lb/> inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a relevant driver for the efficacy. Further in vivo experiments will be needed to<lb/> test this hypothesis. The anti-tubercular in vivo efficacy observed with compound 4 constitutes a successful hit<lb/> optimization for the sulfolane series and for the value of tryptophan synthase as a therapeutic target.<lb/></p>

			<p>Target identification of the sulfolanes and indoline-5-sulfonamides series. Establishing the mode<lb/> of action of inhibitory compounds is an essential step in drug discovery. The identification of biological targets<lb/> is often pursued using a variety of omics-based techniques, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) of resistant<lb/> mutants a proven successful starting point <ref type="biblio">10-12</ref> . Accordingly, this was the preliminary method employed to eluci-<lb/>date the targets of compounds 1, 2 and 3.<lb/></p>

			<p>The MICs of compounds 1, 2 and 3 were established in the Mtb model organism, Mycobacterium bovis BCG<lb/> and determined to be 1 μM, 5 μM and 0.7 μM, respectively. Spontaneous resistant mutants were generated at 5×<lb/> and 10× MIC for each compound. The frequency of resistance (FoR) for each compound at 5× and 10× MIC,<lb/> respectively, were as follows: compound 1, 2 × 10 -8 and 1 × 10 -8 ; compound 2, 3 × 10 -8 and 7 × 10 -8 ; compound<lb/> 3, 9 × 10 -8 and 2 × 10 -8 . The gDNA from a number of spontaneous resistant mutants generated was extracted<lb/> and subjected to WGS as detailed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. High frequency, high-quality (statistically relevant) single nucleotide<lb/> polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the mutant gDNA compared to the sequenced wild-type reference<lb/> strain (Genbank accession number NC_008769.1). SNPs located to: ansP2, encoding asparagine permease; trpA,<lb/> α-subunit of tryptophan synthase; trpB, β-subunit of tryptophan synthase. TrpA and TrpB form tryptophan<lb/> synthase, a heterotetramer of α-and β-subunits (with the configuration of αββ&apos;α&apos;). Asparagine permease is an<lb/> asparagine transporter <ref type="biblio">13</ref> and tryptophan synthase catalyzes the final step in tryptophan biosynthesis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Target validation. The results from the WGS indicate that the inhibitors target a process involving amino<lb/> acid transport or metabolism. Therefore, to pursue this line of investigation, the MIC of wild-type (WT) M.<lb/> bovis BCG with compound 1 was evaluated in minimal media (solid) in the presence and absence of 0.01%<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 2. The in vivo anti-tubercular activity of the sulfolane series. (a) Therapeutic efficacy of 4 and 5 against<lb/> Mtb H37Rv in vivo. C57BL/6 J mice (one mouse per dose) were infected by intratracheal instillation with 10 5<lb/> CFU Mtb H37Rv per mouse. The mice were treated orally once a day from day 1 to day 8 and sacrificed on day<lb/> 9. (b) 4 and 5 were measured in the blood of the infected mice (oral and sc, subcutaneous). Samples from the<lb/> mice used in the efficacy experiment were taken and analyzed. Graph shows Mtb H37Rv MIC of the inhibitors<lb/> as a reference.<lb/></figure>

			<p>l-tryptophan, with glycerol as a carbon source. The results are displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>. In the absence of l-tryptophan,<lb/> the MIC was &lt;1 μM. However, in the presence of l-tryptophan, the MIC was increased to &gt;8 μM. This indicates<lb/> that l-tryptophan rescues the inhibition by compound 1, where the availability of the amino acid in the media<lb/> alleviates the necessity of l-tryptophan de novo synthesis. The same response was observed with compounds 2<lb/> and 3; in liquid minimal medium, l-tryptophan rescued the inhibition by the compounds at 1×, 5× and 10×<lb/> MIC as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>. In combination with the WGS results, it was highly plausible that compounds 1, 2 and<lb/> 3 target tryptophan synthase.<lb/></p>

			<p>The enzymes involved in de novo tryptophan biosynthesis are encoded on the trp operon (5′-3′): trpE, Rv1610,<lb/> trpC, trpB, trpA. To confirm that compounds 1, 2 and 3, target biological components of the tryptophan biosyn-<lb/>thesis, and more specifically tryptophan synthase, the MIC of M. bovis BCG strains over-expressing constituents<lb/> of the trp operon in the presence of the inhibitors was evaluated (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The mycobacterial over-expression<lb/> plasmid, pVV16, was used to generate constructs containing the trp operon (trpE-A), trpB, trpB-N185S, trpA<lb/> and trpA-D64E. The mutation trpB-N185S was selected because it was present in a number of sequenced spon-<lb/>taneous resistant mutants (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). For the generation of a mutant TrpA, the mutation D64E was chosen. D64<lb/> is a conserved residue involved in the communication between the α-and β-subunits, as well as playing a role in<lb/> the opening and closing of the substrate tunnel between the subunits <ref type="biblio">14</ref> . Over-expression of the individual WT<lb/> subunits did not alter the MIC of the compounds. The over-expression of one subunit would not increase the<lb/> copy number of tryptophan synthase complexes within the cell. With no impact on the MICs, this indicates that<lb/> the inhibitors do not bind into the active site of either subunit and are targeting the whole complex. This coin-<lb/>cides with SNPs observed in both trpA and trpB. It is noteworthy that the individual subunits may not exist in a<lb/> conformation conducive to inhibitor binding, which could change upon complex formation. Nevertheless, the<lb/> MICs were increased with the over-expression of the individual mutant subunits; the tryptophan synthase com-<lb/>plex would exist as mixed mutant and WT copies, and although the total copy number of tryptophan synthase<lb/> complexes would remain the same, the mutation enabled the mutant complexes to function in the presence of<lb/> the compounds. Over-expression of the trp operon also resulted in an increase in the MIC. All components of<lb/> the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway would have been over-expressed, including both subunits of the tryptophan<lb/> synthase. Therefore, the total copy number of tryptophan synthase would have been increased, allowing the cell to<lb/> survive at higher concentrations of inhibitors. These results confirm that tryptophan synthase is the target of the<lb/> anti-tubercular compounds 1, 2 and 3. The involvement of AnsP2 in the resistance phenotype is currently under<lb/> investigation and is yet to be determined.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mechanism of inhibition evaluation. Once a target has been confirmed, establishing the mode of inhi-<lb/>bition by a compound is important in its progression through the drug discovery pipeline. Given that the three<lb/> compounds target the tryptophan synthase complex, and not the individual subunits, there are a number of ways<lb/> the compound can exert its effect: preventing complex formation, disrupting the complex after it has formed,<lb/> blocking the conformational changes required for activity, or obstructing the substrate channel between the<lb/></p>

			<p>α-and β-subunits. In order to probe these possibilities, the specific activity of TrpB was evaluated, which cataly-<lb/>ses the synthesis of l-tryptophan from indole (generated by the activity of the α-subunit) and l-serine, using the<lb/> cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Recombinant histidine-tagged Mtb TrpA, Mtb TrpB and Mtb TrpB-F188L<lb/> were over-expressed in E. coli and purified by immobilised metal affinity chromatography and anion exchange.<lb/></p>

The MICs of<lb/> compounds 1, 2 and 3 were analyzed with M. bovis BCG over-expressing the following pVV16 constructs:<lb/> empty, trpA, trpA-D64E, trpB, trpB-N185S, trpA-E. The position of each strain on the agar plate is detailed.<lb/> The control of 0 μM compound is shown, and the growth of the strains were tested at 2× and 8× MIC of each<lb/> compound.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The purified enzymes in different conditions (specifically using the substrates to monitor TrpB activity) were eval-<lb/>uated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and by gel filtration<lb/> high-pressure liquid chromatography (GF-HPLC).<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>TLC was used to analyze the activity of TrpB and TrpB-F188L in combination with compound 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). This<lb/> method enables the production of l-tryptophan to be visualised, confirming TrpB activity. It has been reported<lb/> that TrpB can function in the absence of TrpA, but the presence of the α-subunit enhances activity <ref type="biblio">15</ref> . We were<lb/> unable to establish TrpB activity in the absence of TrpA (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). Therefore, both enzymes were<lb/> incubated in equimolar quantities. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows that TrpB actively synthesised l-tryptophan from l-serine and<lb/> indole (lane 8), and that the synthesis was markedly decreased in the presence of inhibitor (lane 9). TrpB-F188L<lb/> was also shown to produce l-tryptophan (lane 11), although comparatively less to the WT enzyme (lane 8).<lb/> However, in the presence of compound 2, TrpB-F188L generated relatively the same amount of tryptophan (lane<lb/> 12) compared to when in the absence of inhibitor (lane 11). Although this method of tryptophan production is<lb/> not quantifiable, it is apparent that the mutation imparts a fitness cost, but concurrently alleviates the impact of<lb/> the inhibitor.<lb/></p>

			<p>The native PAGE analysis of the tryptophan synthase is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. The individual subunits of TrpA, TrpB<lb/> and TrpB-F188L were analyzed individually (lanes 1-3) and in equimolar combinations (TrpA with either TrpB<lb/> or TrpB-F188L) (lane 4 and 8). Discrete bands for each subunit were observed in each case. In the presence of<lb/> the inhibitor (compound 3) (lanes 6 and 10), this result does not change, indicating that the compound cannot<lb/> induce complex formation. In the presence of the TrpB substrates, however, an additional band was observed,<lb/> suggesting the formation of WT and mutant complexes (lanes 5 and 9). Furthermore, additional bands were<lb/> observed in the presence of substrates and inhibitor for the WT complex (lane 7), but not for the mutant (lane 11).<lb/> Tryptophan synthase is a dynamic enzyme, traversing through a number of conformational states in the synthesis<lb/> of l-tryptophan <ref type="biblio">16</ref> . In the presence of the inhibitor, complex formation appeared to be enhanced. It is possible that<lb/> the inhibitor locks the enzyme in one conformation, preventing structural fluctuations required for activity. These<lb/> results warranted further investigation by GF-HPLC.<lb/></p>

			<p>The GF-HPLC results corroborate the observations made from the native PAGE. TrpA and TrpB each eluted as<lb/> a single peak from the gel filtration column, where TrpB exists as a dimer in solution. The subunits were analyzed<lb/> in equimolar concentrations, individually, together and in combination with compound 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>). Under these<lb/> conditions, there was no observable peak shift illustrating complex formation. To probe the precise requirements<lb/> of complex formation as observed using native PAGE, the cofactor and substrates were incubated with TrpA and<lb/> TrpB. PLP alone was found to be capable of driving complex formation, as signified by peak shifts: the TrpA peak<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 5. TLC analysis of tryptophan synthase activity and compound 2 inhibition. TrpA and TrpB or TrpB-<lb/>F188L were incubated with substrates and the tryptophan produced was analyzed by TLC. In the presence<lb/> of compound 2, the TrpB activity of the complex was clearly inhibited. However, the TrpB-F188L activity in<lb/> the presence or absence of inhibitor was comparable. The individual reaction components were analyzed as<lb/> controls. The bands representing l-serine and l-tryptophan are shown, and the remaining reaction components<lb/> had no concernable bands in the solvent system and stain used.<lb/></figure>

			<p>reduced and the TrpB peak shifted to a higher elution volume, signifying a higher molecular weight and complex<lb/> formation. Interestingly, upon incubation of the enzymes with PLP and compound 2, there was further reduction<lb/> in the TrpA peak and an additional subtle shift to a higher molecular weight of the peak representing the complex.<lb/> There was no peak shift of TrpB when it was incubated with PLP and inhibitor. These results indicate that the<lb/> inhibitor does not block complex formation, nor disrupts the complex once it has formed. Intrinsic tryptophan<lb/> fluorescence binding assays were performed with compounds 2 and 3 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>) indicating binding<lb/> of both inhibitors to the PLP-induced tryptophan synthase complex.<lb/></p>

			<p>l-tryptophan production by the WT TrpB and TrpB-F188L was also visualised using GF-HPLC (Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>). In<lb/> the presence of TrpA, substrates and cofactor, WT TrpB is able to synthesise l-tryptophan. However, with the<lb/> addition of compound 3 (inhibitor does not co-elute with l-tryptophan, unlike compound 2), there was a signif-<lb/>icant decrease in the l-tryptophan produced. The same analyzes were performed using TrpB-F188L. It is clear,<lb/> that even with the inhibitor present, l-tryptophan was produced. To determine whether the F188L mutation pre-<lb/>vents the binding of the inhibitor to the complex, enabling l-tryptophan synthesis, TrpA and TrpB-F188L were<lb/> incubated with PLP (to generate the complex) and compound 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>). Surprisingly, the complex peak shifted<lb/> to a lower elution volume as observed with the WT subunits. These results demonstrate that the inhibitor was still<lb/> able to bind to the mutant complex.<lb/></p>

			<p>Structural insights into the location of resistance conferring mutations. We attempted to deter-<lb/>mine the structure of Mtb tryptophan synthase complex bound to compound 2 by X-ray crystallography, yielding<lb/> a low resolution (4.0 Å) structure (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). The 4.0 Å X-ray diffraction data set could be phased by molecular<lb/> replacement (MR, see Methods for details). Despite the limited resolution, confidence in the MR solution is jus-<lb/>tified by several criteria: a) high Z-scores (Phaser: Z &gt; 10); b) a complete crystallographic lattice (i.e. all subunits<lb/> make packing interactions with either crystallographic or non-crystallographically related neighbors); c) clearly<lb/> discernible difference in density for the PLP co-factor in all β-subunits plus additional density for the N-terminal<lb/> helix of the TrpA subunit, which was absent in the search model. In total, 6 copies of the α 2 β 2 heterotetrameric<lb/> complex were placed in the orthorhombic unit cell (space group F222), to yield a crystallographic lattice in which<lb/> 4 copies of the α 2 β 2 complex form a ring-like structure, and rings assemble to form pseudo-trigonal nodes in the<lb/> 3-dimensional lattice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>We mapped the sites of spontaneous resistance-conferring mutations onto the (partially refined) MR<lb/> solution (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). The resistance-conferring mutations cluster at the interface between the α-and β-subunits<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). While mutations on the β-subunit dominate, the mutation α:D136N is situated on a surface element<lb/> of the α-subunit that covers the substrate tunnel between the α-and β-subunits (Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>). This structural evi-<lb/>dence is consistent with the size-exclusion chromatography results, indicating that adding inhibitor to the<lb/> PLP-loaded α 2 β 2 complex further promotes complex formation between the two subunits. Finally, we observe<lb/> a well-defined patch of difference density at contour levels of 2.5 σ in a site surrounded by the resistance muta-<lb/>tions (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). This density patch is clearly visible in 9 of the 12 α-β interfaces. Shape and extent<lb/> of this density patch are entirely compatible with the molecular structure of the compound 2, and indicate a<lb/> consistent orientation of the inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). The sulfoxide group faces the hydrophilic α-β<lb/> interface, packing against α:Asp136, one of the resistance sites. The fluorine substituted phenol ring packs against<lb/> a hydrophobic environment, formed by Phe202, Phe211 and the resistance site Pro208. The central indole moiety<lb/></p>

TrpA and TrpB (or TrpB-F188L) did not form a complex, which was also not<lb/> observable in the presence of inhibitor. In the presence of substrates, the complex formed, which was enhanced<lb/> with inhibitor in the WT but not the mutant complexes.<lb/></figure>

			<figure>Figure 7. Insights into inhibitor mode of action using gel filtration of tryptophan synthase. Gel filtration was<lb/> used to analyze the TrpA and TrpB subunits and conditions required for complex formation to give insights<lb/> into the impact of the TrpB-F188L mutation and the mode of action of the inhibitors. (a) Complex formation<lb/> requirements of tryptophan synthase. TrpA and TrpB eluted as individual peaks in the presence or absence of<lb/> compound 2. PLP induced complex formation, which was enhanced in the presence of the inhibitor. Samples<lb/> were incubated for 1 h and analyzed with absorbance at 210 nm. (b) l-Tryptophan synthesis by TrpB and TrpB-<lb/>F188L in the presence and absence of compound 3. Compound 3 inhibited l-tryptophan synthesis by TrpB,<lb/> but not TrpB-F188L. Samples were incubated for 1 h and 2 h for TrpB and TrpB-F188L containing reactions<lb/> respectively and analyzed with absorbance at 280 nm (to observe l-tryptophan). (c) Mutant tryptophan<lb/> synthase (TrpB-F188L) complex formation is driven by compound 3. As observed with WT TrpB, PLP induced<lb/> complex formation and this was further enhanced by the inhibitor. Samples were incubated for 1 h and analyzed<lb/> with absorbance at 280 nm. The peaks are labeled accordingly. The samples are colored as follows: TrpA, brown;<lb/> TrpB/TrpB-F188L, green; TrpA and TrpB/TrpB-F188L, orange; TrpA, TrpB/TrpB-F188L and inhibitor (light<lb/> blue); TrpA, TrpB/TrpB-F188L and PLP, purple; TrpA, TrpB/TrpB-F188L, PLP and inhibitor, grey; TrpA, TrpB/<lb/> TrpB-F188L, PLP, indole and l-serine, light green; TrpA, TrpB/TrpB-F188L, PLP, indole, l-serine and inhibitor,<lb/> dark blue.<lb/></figure>

			<p>forms stacking interactions with Phe188, also a resistance site. While the structural detail revealed by a 4 Å map is<lb/> evidently limited, the location of the difference density, its consistent appearance in 9 of 12 β-subunits at contour<lb/> levels distinctly above noise, and the immediate proximity to the sites of resistance-conferring mutations, includ-<lb/>ing α:D136, clearly support the interpretation of this density patch as the inhibitor. Thus, the crystallographic<lb/> evidence in conjunction with the location of resistance conferring mutations strongly suggest that the inhibitor<lb/> binds at the interface between the two subunits and may inhibit diffusion of the indole ring from the active site of<lb/> the α-subunit to that of the β-subunit.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of Mtb has made more urgent the need for novel inhibitor<lb/> scaffolds targeting unexploited biosynthetic pathways. Phenotypic HTS strategies have driven the identification<lb/> of small molecule inhibitors of Mtb <ref type="biblio">7, 8</ref> and equally important, inhibitors from these screens are directing the dis-<lb/>covery of novel targets, whilst also renewing the potential of recognized, unexploited ones <ref type="biblio">10-12, 17-19</ref> . In this work,<lb/> we have identified two new chemical scaffolds with anti-tubercular activities. Through a number of in vivo and in<lb/> vitro experiments, we have confirmed tryptophan synthase as the target of the two structurally distinct inhibitor<lb/> series.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tryptophan synthase, composed of a heterotetramer of TrpA and TrpB subunits, catalyzes the final step in<lb/> tryptophan biosynthesis. The α-subunit cleaves indole-3-glycerol phosphate to indole and glycerophosphate, the<lb/> former diffusing to the active site of the β-subunit where it is covalently bound to l-serine forming l-tryptophan<lb/> in a PLP-dependent oxidation/reduction reaction. We have shown that the tryptophan synthase complex, rather<lb/> than its individual subunits, is the target of compounds 1, 2 and 3. This is supported by evidence from the<lb/> sequencing of spontaneous resistant mutants raised against the compounds, which revealed mutations in both<lb/> trpA and trpB.<lb/></p>

Residues appearing in resistance-conferring mutations are shown in spheres (green) as<lb/> is the PLP co-factor (cyan). The inhibitor-binding site is indicated by spheres in yellow. (b) Close-up view of<lb/> the cluster of resistance sites. Left and right panels are linked by a 90° rotation about the vertical direction. The<lb/> β-subunit is shown as a ribbon (orange) with a transparent molecular surface, while parts of the α-subunit<lb/> backbone (blue) are shown for residues in contact with the β-subunit surface. Resistance sites (green) and the<lb/> PLP co-factor (cyan) are indicated.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Assignment of the tryptophan synthase complex as the drug target is also supported by over-expression data<lb/> in M. bovis BCG. Over-expression of the individual WT subunits did not alter the MIC of compounds 1, 2 and<lb/> 3. In contrast, in the strains where the tryptophan synthase complex was over-expressed (trpA-E), an increase in<lb/> resistance was observed. Furthermore, there was an increase in resistance of strains that over-expressed mutant<lb/> copies of the individual subunits. Finally, supplementing minimal media with l-tryptophan rescued the growth<lb/> inhibition of M. bovis BCG caused by compounds 1, 2 and 3. Taken together, the resistance, overexpression and<lb/> supplementation data clearly support the notion of the tryptophan synthase complex as the validated target of<lb/> the three compounds.<lb/></p>

			<p>Biochemical studies were used to probe the mechanism of action of inhibitors, and establish how the specific<lb/> mutations imparted resistance. First, TLC (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) was used to establish TrpB activity (in the presence of TrpA)<lb/> (lane 8). The activity was markedly reduced in the presence of the inhibitor compound 2 (lane 9). Conversely, the<lb/> activity of TrpB-F188L (lane 11) was significantly less than the WT counterpart, but it retained comparable levels<lb/> of activity in the presence of the inhibitor (lane 12). Therefore, the resistance conferring mutation, whilst alleviat-<lb/>ing the impact of the inhibitor, imparts a fitness cost on enzyme activity. In a whole cell setting, the activity of the<lb/> mutant enzyme must be sufficient because it allows cell survival in high concentrations of drug.<lb/></p>

			<p>Native PAGE (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) and gel filtration (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>) were used to analyze the effect of the inhibitor on complex<lb/> formation. Native PAGE demonstrated that complex formation occurred in the presence of all substrates (lanes<lb/> 5 and 9), and this could not be induced by the inhibitor alone (lanes 6 and 10). These results were corroborated<lb/> by gel filtration. Native PAGE also demonstrated that inhibitor appeared to drive complex formation (lane 7),<lb/> potentially trapping the complex in one conformational state. This was not observed with TrpB-F188L (lane<lb/> 11), and led us to investigate further using gel filtration. As anticipated from the native PAGE, the inhibitor was<lb/> shown to drive and not disrupt complex formation of the subunits, and that PLP specifically was a requirement<lb/> for complexation. Surprisingly, this result was emulated by TrpB-F188L. Therefore, the inhibitors were still able<lb/> to bind to the mutant complex, and in the presence of indole and l-serine, l-tryptophan was produced. The α-<lb/>and β-subunits are proposed to switch between catalytically inactive (open) and active (closed) conformations <ref type="biblio">20</ref> .<lb/> Communication between the two sites enables the activities to be coordinated, preventing the escape of indole<lb/> and enabling this product of the α-subunit to be channeled through a hydrophobic tunnel to the β-subunit. It is<lb/> therefore plausible that whilst the inhibitor is still able to bind to the mutant complex, the F188L mutation allows<lb/> a degree of flexibility, enabling substrate channeling and communication between the subunits.<lb/></p>

			<p>Inter-subunit communications of tryptophan synthase subunits are under allosteric control, and mediated<lb/> by a region named the COMM domain <ref type="biblio">21</ref> . Changes at either active site result in a disruption of interactions with<lb/> the COMM domain, causing molecular movements to transmit the signal <ref type="biblio">22</ref> . The cooperativity between the sub-<lb/>units ensures that indole is only synthesized at the α-site following the reaction of l-serine at the β-site. The<lb/> well-studied Salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase crystal structure reveals a 25 Å hydrophobic tunnel<lb/> connecting the catalytic sites of the α-and β-subunits, which is modulated by a molecular gate formed by the<lb/> residues β-Tyr279 and β-Phe280 21 . The COMM domain controls the opening of the gate to allow the passage<lb/> of indole through the tunnel for reaction at the β-site and l-tryptophan formation. To establish the roles of the<lb/> resistance conferring mutations, we have aligned the Mtb TrpA and TrpB protein sequences (former residue),<lb/> with those of the S. typhimurium TrpA and TrpB (latter residue): α-D136/D130; β-I184/C170; β-N185/N171;<lb/> β-F188/L174; β-P208/P194; β-F293/Y279. These residues locate to the α-β inter-subunit interface, also confirmed<lb/> by the X-ray crystal structure, and are involved in the global motion of the α-subunit relative to the β-subunit,<lb/> particularly residues β-174-179 <ref type="biblio">21</ref> . There are a number of closely interacting inter-and intra-subunit pairs includ-<lb/>ing α-D130-βPro18, α-D56-N171 and β-N171-βY279 <ref type="biblio">14, 21</ref> . The β-N171 residue of the latter pair is involved in the<lb/> reorientation of the β-Y279 gate. β-C170 is located on the wall of the tunnel, where mutations to bulky side chains<lb/> restrict tunnel access and impair α-β subunit communication <ref type="biblio">22</ref> . It is therefore plausible that the inhibitors bind<lb/> at the interface, blocking substrate channeling or inter-subunit communication. The resistance conferring muta-<lb/>tions could introduce an additional level of flexibility, alleviating any rigidity imposed by the inhibitor, or in the<lb/> case of the β-F293C (equivalent to β-Y279), the mutation to a less bulky side chain might prevent access restric-<lb/>tion of the tunnel caused directly by the inhibitor or through the blocking of the conformational communications.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tryptophan biosynthesis represents an attractive drug target. The genes encoding the tryptophan synthase<lb/> subunits are essential, as are the remaining genes in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. In fact, mycobacteria<lb/> have a number of essential genes to synthesise all amino acids de novo. Inhibition of the synthesis of a single or<lb/> multiple amino acids would impose auxotrophism in Mtb, necessitating an external amino acid source for cell<lb/> survival. In the case of tryptophan biosynthesis, the bioavailability of l-tryptophan is limited; in response to<lb/> Mtb infection, macrophages in the granuloma express the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO), metabolizing<lb/> l-tryptophan to l-kynurenine, thus enhancing the impact of inhibitors <ref type="biblio">23, 24</ref> . Therefore, inhibition of l-tryptophan<lb/> biosynthesis in the setting of IDO activity is an innovative strategy for TB chemotherapy. In this work we have<lb/> validated the therapeutic relevance of tryptophan synthase in vivo: in a mouse model with an incipient immune<lb/> response (IDO activation and tryptophan catabolism are limited), compound 4 was efficacious. Better results are<lb/> expected in clinical environments in which the host response has tryptophan starvation mechanisms fully active.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mtb amino acid biosynthesis has been largely unexplored from a drug target perspective. The fundamen-<lb/>tal requirement of amino acids for viability makes the inhibition of these processes suitable targets to pursue.<lb/> Importantly, the clinical use of inhibitors of amino acid biosynthesis would have a minimal effect on the normal<lb/> gut flora because it is rich in amino acids that can protect against compound toxicity <ref type="biblio">25</ref> . Additionally, there is a<lb/> dietary requirement of a number of amino acids: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, thre-<lb/>onine, tryptophan and valine. Targeting the biosynthetic pathways against these amino acids, which are likely<lb/> to lack human orthologues, would reduce the toxic potential of inhibitors. These factors further encourage our<lb/> exploration into tryptophan biosynthesis as a target of anti-tubercular compounds.<lb/></p>

			<p>HepG2 cytotoxicity. HepG2 cells were cultured using Eagle&apos;s minumim essential medium (MEM) sup-<lb/>plemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% non-essential amino acid (NEAA) and<lb/> 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Prior to addition of the cell suspension, 250 nL of test compounds per well were<lb/> pre-dispensed in TC-treated black clear-bottomed 384-well plates (Greiner) with an Echo 555 instrument. After<lb/> that, 25 μL of HepG2 (ATCC HB-8065) cells (~3000 cells/well) grown to confluency in Eagle&apos;s MEM supple-<lb/>mented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% NEAA and 1% penicillin/streptomycin were added to each well with<lb/> the reagent dispenser.

			<p>MIC evaluation and generation of spontaneous resistant mutants. M. bovis BCG strain Pasteur and<lb/> derivatives were cultured in static liquid or solid medium at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 . Liquid medium: Middlebrook 7H9<lb/> (Difco), 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80, 10% (v/v) Middlebrook ADC and 0.25% (v/v) glycerol. Solid medium: Middlebrook<lb/> 7H11 agar (Difco) with 10% (v/v) Middlebrook OADC and 0.5% (v/v) glycerol. Where applicable, 25 μg/mL kan-<lb/>amycin was added to the media to select for mycobacterial plasmids. The MIC was determined by plating 10 4 , 10 3 ,<lb/> 10 2 , and 10 1 cells from a mid-log culture of M. bovis BCG on solid medium containing increasing concentrations of<lb/> inhibitor in a dose response. The MIC was the lowest concentration of compound that caused complete inhibition of<lb/> bacterial growth. M. bovis BCG spontaneous resistant mutants were generated on solid media at 5×, 10×, and 20×<lb/> MIC. Resistant isolates were confirmed by first culturing in liquid media (in the absence of compound) before retest-<lb/>ing on solid media containing 5× MIC of each compound. The genomic DNA was extracted and purified according<lb/> to standard procedures. Photographs of agar plates were taken with a Canon PowerShot G16 and Biorad Gel Doc<lb/> XR+ using Image Lab software. Images were processed using Adobe Illustrator 5.0 software.<lb/></p>

			<p>Sequencing of M. bovis BCG spontaneous resistant mutants. M. bovis BCG WT and resistant<lb/> mutant strains were characterised by WGS. Briefly, the genomic DNA was prepared for sequencing by the genera-<lb/>tion of DNA libraries (Nextera DNA Sample Preparation Kit, Illumina), which were purified (Agencourt AMPure<lb/> XP beads, Beckman Coulter Genomics), quantified (Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA kit, Life Technologies) and the<lb/> fragment sizes were evaluated (2100 Bioanalyzer with a High Sensitivity DNA chip, Agilent Technologies). The<lb/> DNA libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq Benchtop Sequencer (MiSeq Reagent Kit v2, 300 cycles). The genome<lb/> sequence of M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P2 (accession: NC_008769.1) was used as a reference to align reads.<lb/></p>

			<p>Generation of plasmid expression constructs. The mycobacterial and Escherichia coli over-expression<lb/> constructs were generated in the plasmids pVV16 and pET28a respectively, both of which encode kanamycin<lb/> selection. For constructs generated in pVV16, the stop codon was not included in the antisense primer, enabling<lb/> the C-terminal vector-encoded histidine tag to be exploited. Conversely, primers designed for the generation of<lb/> pET28a constructs, the stop codon was included, where a vector encoded N-terminal histidine tag is employed.<lb/> Initially, primers were designed to clone trpA, trpB (and the mutant equivalents) and the trp operon (pVV16<lb/> only) into the multiple cloning sites of pVV16 and pET28a, exploiting the restriction sites NdeI and HindIII. The<lb/> primers are listed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions, the genes were amplified by PCR from<lb/> M. bovis BCG (WT or mutant) genomic DNA using Q5 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Following<lb/> purification (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen), the PCR products and the vectors were digested with the<lb/> restriction enzymes specified (FastDigest, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the digest products were purified via gel<lb/> extraction from a 1% agarose gel (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen). Digest products were ligated using T4<lb/> DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) and transformed into E. coli TOP10 cells. The constructs in positive clones<lb/> were verified by DNA sequencing (Eurofins Genomics).<lb/></p>

			<p>Electroporation of mycobacterial expression constructs. Electrocompetent M. bovis BCG cells were<lb/> prepared by pelleting and subsequently washing a mid-log culture with decreasing volumes of ice-cold 10% (v/v)<lb/> glycerol. The cells were incubated on ice with 1 μg plasmid DNA, before being transferred to a 0.1 cm electrode<lb/> gap electroporation cuvette. A single pulse of 1.8 kV was applied, and the cells were recovered by incubation over-<lb/>night in liquid media, before positive clones were selected on solid medium containing the appropriate antibiotic.<lb/></p>

			<p>l-Tryptophan supplementation experiments. The MIC of compound 1 against M. bovis BCG was ana-<lb/>lyzed on solid minimal medium in the presence of 0.01% l-tryptophan. The minimal media (pH7.5) contained<lb/> 11 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0.8 mM MgSO 4 , 4.6 μM ferric ammonium citrate, 25 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 19 mM NH 4 Cl, 0.14 mM CaCl 2 ,<lb/> 14.5 mM NaCl using 0.1% glycerol as a carbon source and 1.5% agar. The MIC was evaluated as previously described.<lb/></p>

			<p>The impact of M. bovis BCG viability in the presence of 1×, 5× and 10× compound 2 or 3 was analyzed in liq-<lb/>uid minimal media with and without 0.01% l-tryptophan. Cells were cultured to OD 600 nm 0.6-0.8 and diluted to<lb/> 1 × 10 6 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL (OD 600 nm 1.0 = 2.5 × 10 8 CFU/mL) in minimal media with and without<lb/> 0.01% (v/v) l-tryptophan. 1 μL compound (100% DMSO) (using stocks of 5 mM, 25 mM and 50 mM compound<lb/> 2 or 0.7 mM, 3.5 mM and 7 mM compound 3 (1×, 5× and 10× MIC)) and appropriate controls (1 μL DMSO or<lb/> 1 μL 1 mM INH) were aliquoted into a 96-well plate (flat, black bottom, polystyrene) in duplicate. 99 μL 1 × 10 6<lb/> CFU/mL ( +/-l-tryptophan) were added to each well and then the plate was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 for 7<lb/> days. 30 μL 0.02% (w/v) resazurin and 12.5 μL 20% (v/v) Tween 80 was added and the plate was incubated in the<lb/> same conditions for 24 h. Fluorescence was measured by λ excitation at 530 nm and λ emission at 590 nm using<lb/> a POLARstar Omega plate reader.<lb/></p>

			<p>Expression and purification of recombinant TrpA and TrpB. Recombinant TrpA and TrpB were<lb/> over-expressed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells from the pET28a constructs. TrpA over-expression was optimised using<lb/> the Studier method of autoinduction <ref type="biblio">26</ref> . Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 180 rpm, until OD 600 nm 0.2 was reached.<lb/> The temperature was reduced to 20 °C and the cells were cultured overnight before harvesting. Recombinant TrpB<lb/> was over-expressed by 0.5 mM IPTG induction of a mid-log culture grown in terrific broth at 37 °C, 180 rpm.<lb/> Following induction, the cells were cultured overnight at 16 °C before harvesting.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recombinant TrpA and TrpB were purified using identical methods. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer<lb/> (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl and 25 mM imidazole) containing DNAse and Complete pro-<lb/>tease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Cells were sonicated, 30 s on, 30 s off, for 12 cycles. Insoluble material<lb/> was pelleted at 18,000 rpm. The clarified lysate was applied to a 1 mL, pre-equilibrated (in buffer) nickel-charged<lb/> IMAC column. A step gradient of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300 and 1000 mM imidazole (in buffer) was used to wash<lb/> the column and elute the recombinant proteins. TrpA eluted at 100 mM imidazole, whereas the cleanest fraction<lb/> of TrpB eluted at 150 mM imidazole. The proteins were immediately buffer-exchanged into 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5,<lb/> 10% (v/v) glycerol. Anion exchange was performed, where the proteins eluted from a 1 mL Q HP anion exchange<lb/> column over an increasing NaCl gradient. Purified proteins were stored at -20 °C.<lb/></p>

			<p>TLC. In order to visualise amino acids by TLC, 5 μg is needed (10 μL loaded). Therefore, each reaction was per-<lb/>formed in 100 μL with substrates (indole and l-serine) and control (l-tryptophan) at 0.5 μg/μL. Each reaction was<lb/> performed in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. TrpA and TrpB/TrpB-F188L were present in equimolar quan-<lb/>tities (10 μM each). PLP was added to 100 μM. Where applicable, compound 2 was added to 100 μM, and replaced<lb/> by an equivalent volume of DMSO. The final DMSO concentration of reactions was 1% (v/v). The reactions were<lb/> incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Once loaded, the TLC (silica gel 60) was developed in butanol:acetic<lb/> acid:H 2 O (12:3:5 (v/v/v)). Ninhydrin was used to detect the amino acids. TLCs were imaged using a Canon EOS<lb/> 5D Mark III and processed using Adobe Illustrator 5.0 software.<lb/></p>

			<p>Native PAGE. Samples were prepared for native PAGE with the following concentrations in combinations<lb/> as stated (buffer, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl; total volume, 10 μL): 3.6 μM TrpA, 3.6 μM TrpB, 20 μM<lb/> compound 3, 1 mM indole, 1 mM PLP, 100 mM serine. Samples were diluted in an equal volume of sample buffer<lb/> (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 40% (w/v) glycerol, 0.01% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and resolved in 25 mM Tris,<lb/> 192 mM glycine, using a precast gel (Biorad). Images were taken using a Biorad Gel Doc XR+ with Image Lab<lb/> software, and processed using Adobe Illustrator 5.0 software.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>GF-HPLC. HPLC using a gel filtration column (TSKgel G3000SW XL , 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) was<lb/> used to analyze TrpA and TrpB, measuring absorbance at 210 nm or 280 nm. Samples were prepared in 50 μL with<lb/> the following components (in combinations as stated): 20 μM TrpA, 20 μM TrpB/TrpB-F188L, 100 μM PLP, 100 μM<lb/> indole, 100 μM serine, 100 μM compound 2/3. The reaction buffer was 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. Samples<lb/> were incubated at room temperature for 1-2 h (as specified). GF-HPLC was performed on a Thermo Scientific<lb/> Ultimate 3000, and data was recorded on Chromeleon software. Images were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.<lb/></p>

			<p>Crystallisation conditions. Purified recombinant TrpA and TrpB were incubated together in equimolar con-<lb/>centrations (8.64 μM) with 86.4 μM PLP, 400 μM indole and 40 mM l-serine in a final volume of 6 mL. After incu-<lb/>bation at room temperature for 1 h, compound 2 was added to 86.4 μM and the reaction was incubated for a further<lb/> 1 h before concentrating to 120 μL (equivalent to 10 mg/mL TrpA). Crystallisation conditions were screened using a<lb/> number of sparse matrix screens (Molecular Dimensions) with 300 nL sitting drops (150 nL drops of protein solu-<lb/>tion and screen) dispensed by a liquid handling robot. Crystals formed in 0.1 M HEPES, pH 6.0, 50% polypropylene<lb/> glycol 400, 5% DMSO at 18 °C. X-ray diffraction data were recorded at the Diamond Light Source.<lb/></p>

			<p>X-ray crystallographic structure determination. X-ray data to 4.0 Å resolution were recorded on beam-<lb/>line I04 at the Diamond Light Source (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>), using a Pilatus 6 M area detector (DECTRIS).<lb/> The X-ray diffraction images were integrated and scaled using the software XDS, XSCALE <ref type="biblio">27</ref> , and AIMLESS of<lb/> the CCP4 package <ref type="biblio">28</ref> . The structure was solved by molecular replacement, using the PHASER software <ref type="biblio">29, 30</ref> and<lb/> the heterotetrameric TrpAB complex from Pyrococcus furiosus as a search model (pdb entry 5E0K <ref type="biblio">31</ref> , 33% identity<lb/> for TrpA, 58% for TrpB). The search model was stripped of side chains that are not conserved between the target<lb/> and the P. furiosus structure. Given the large unit cell, the Matthews coefficient analysis did not yield a definitive<lb/> guide to the number copies present in the asymmetric unit. Nevertheless, placing copies of the heterotetrameric<lb/> complex consecutively and selecting the correct solution based on the Z-score (18.5 to 21.3) of the translation<lb/> function allowed to unequivocally determine the position of 6 copies of the αββα complex, leading to a crystal-<lb/>lographically plausible 3D lattice (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). Later on, coordinates of the refined structure of the<lb/> TrpAB complex of M. tuberculosis became available in the PDB (entry 5TCG, 2.4 Å resolution <ref type="biblio">32</ref> ). This coordinate<lb/> set was stripped of water molecules and co-factors, mapped onto the molecular solution, and used to correct the<lb/> structural model. The resulting density map consistently showed density for the PLP co-factor, the coordinates of<lb/> which were excluded from the search model. Density was also visible for N-terminal helix of the TrpA subunit,<lb/> which is absent in the P. furiosus ortholog. The additional density, together with the high translation function<lb/> Z-scores, gave confidence that the correct solution had been found. A partial refinement of the molecular replace-<lb/>ment solution led to an R free of 36.9%, refining coordinates, and modelling temperature factors through TLS<lb/> refinement and a uniform B-factor for each protein chain. The difference density map in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S3<lb/></ref> was calculated based on protein coordinates, prior to incorporation of the co-factor or ligands in the model. The<lb/> model of the inhibitor compound 2 was placed manually into the unbiased difference density and adjusted using<lb/> real space refinement <ref type="biblio">33</ref> , but not included in the crystallographic refinement of the model.<lb/></p>

			<p>Mice. Specific Pathogen-free 6-8-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice (18-20 g) were obtained from Envigo<lb/> (Barcelona, Spain). The experiments were performed at AAALAC-accredited GlaxoSmithKline Laboratory Animal<lb/> Science animal facilities in Tres Cantos (Madrid, Spain). The mice were kept in air-filtered isolators with twenty air<lb/> changes per hour. Room temperature and relative humidity were 22 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 10%, respectively. The mice<lb/> were accommodated in groups of up to five individuals in Tecniplast ® type IV cages with autoclaved dust free corn-<lb/>cob bedding (Rettenmaier Iberica, S. L., Barcelona, Spain). The mice were maintained under a 12 h light/dark period.<lb/> Filtered tap water and γ-irradiated pelleted diet from Envigo (Barcelona, Spain) were provided ad libitum.<lb/></p>

			<p>In vivo efficacy assessment. The experimental design has been previously described <ref type="biblio">34</ref> . In brief, mice were<lb/> intratracheally infected with 100,000 CFU/mouse (Mtb H37Rv). Products were administered for 8 consecutive<lb/> days starting one day after infection. Lungs were harvested 24 h after the last administration. All lung lobes were<lb/> aseptically removed 24 h after the last administration, homogenized and frozen. Homogenates were plated in 10%<lb/> OADC-7H11 medium for 14 days at 37 °C. Homogenates from compound treated mice were incubated for 18<lb/> days at 37 °C in plates supplemented with 0.4% (wt, vol) activated charcoal (Sigma Aldrich) to prevent the effect of<lb/> product carryover. Moxifloxacin (Sequoia Research Products Ltd) was prepared as solution in 20% Captisol(R)/<lb/> water.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>Blood samples (aliquots of 15 μL) were taken from the infected mice by the lateral tail vein at the following time<lb/> points: compound 4 (oral route): 0.5, 2, 6, 24, 48, 120, 168 and 192 h; compound 5 (subcutaneous route): 0.17, 1, 6,<lb/> 24, 48, 120, 168 and 192 h. LC-MS/MS was used as the analytical method for the determination of compound con-<lb/>centration in blood. Plots of blood levels were generated with GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc).<lb/></p>

			<p>Statistical analysis. Graphic data were prepared with GraphPad Prism software and the results were ana-<lb/>lyzed as stated in the text.</p>
