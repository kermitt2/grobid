			<head>CERAMIDE AND S1P BOTH TRIGGER AUTOPHAGY<lb/></head>

			<p>The metabolism of sphingolipids is a dynamic process generating second messengers<lb/> such as ceramide and S1P. 1 The formation of ceramide is followed by a deacylation to form<lb/> sphingosine, which is subsequently phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases (SK), leading<lb/> to S1P formation. It is now generally accepted that ceramide and S1P have contrasting<lb/> roles on the response to cell stress. 2 Ceramide is associated with cell growth arrest and cell<lb/> death induction, whereas S1P stimulates proliferation and maintains survival in numerous<lb/> cell types.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Our group has investigated the correlation between sphingolipid metabolism, the<lb/> autophagic capacities and the cell signaling pathways; we showed that ceramide and S1P<lb/> are able to induce autophagy in a breast cancer cell line. 3,4<lb/></p> 

			<p>First, we showed that ceramide could mediate tamoxifen-induced autophagy, which<lb/> represents a model of autophagic cell death. 5 It was shown that tamoxifen induced an<lb/> increase of endogenous ceramide levels responsible for a robust accumulation of Beclin1<lb/> and an inhibition of Akt/PKB phosphorylation, which tend to increase the autophagic<lb/> response. In addition, we also showed that treatment by short permeant ceramide<lb/> (C2-ceramide) mimicked these effects. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of<lb/> endogenous long chain ceramide biosynthesis by fumonisin B1 (FB1), prevents autophagic<lb/> induction by tamoxifen. Interestingly, Kondo and colleagues have shown, that treatment<lb/> of glioma cells with C2-ceramide increased autophagy and cell death by activating Bnip3,<lb/> a proapoptotic mitochondrial protein. 6 These modulatory effects on protein expression<lb/> appear to constitute three alternative steps for ceramide to regulate autophagy.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The fact that ceramide and S1P constitute a rheostat system involved in the control of<lb/> cell death, prompted us to investigate the role of S1P on autophagy. Surprisingly, we<lb/> observed that the increase of S1P levels after sphingosine kinase 1 overexpression is able to<lb/> induce autophagy. 3 This S1P-induced autophagy correlates with the inhibition of the<lb/> mTOR activity (without alteration of Akt/PKB phosphorylation) and a moderate increase<lb/> in the amount of Beclin 1. In addition, SK1 activity increased during nutrient starvation,<lb/> and inhibition of SK1 by siRNA prevented autophagy and exacerbated cell death with<lb/> apoptotic hallmarks induced by starvation. These results suggest that autophagy is a novel<lb/> function of S1P in cell survival.<lb/></p>

			<head>TWO DIFFERENT AUTOPHAGIC PROCESSES CONTROLLED BY SPHINGOLIPIDS?<lb/></head>

			<p>The above observations reinforced the ambiguous involvement of autophagy in the cell<lb/> lifetime. However, some key differences were noted between ceramide and S1P-induced<lb/> autophagy that could account for the decision of the cell to survive or die. Distinctions<lb/> appear in the step of signaling pathway alteration (ceramide acts upstream of S1P), in the<lb/> amplitude of the autophagic response (ceramide could trigger a stronger response) and in<lb/> the nature of the stress (only SK<lb/> activity increased after starvation)<lb/> (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Ceramide acts upstream of<lb/> S1P by inhibiting Akt/PKB<lb/> phosphorylation, which is associ-<lb/>ated with autophagy suppression<lb/> and reduction of cell viability. 7,8<lb/> S1P acts only at the level of<lb/> mTOR, independently of the<lb/> PI3K arm, in a direct or indirect<lb/> manner, as suggested by the<lb/> inhibition of phosphorylation of<lb/> mTOR substrates (p70S6K,<lb/> 4E-BP1). Does this observation<lb/> mean that in comparison with S1P,<lb/> ceramide has a broad-spectrum<lb/> of targets potentially linked to<lb/> cell death induction.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Although Beclin 1 is a common<lb/> target for both sphingolipids, a<lb/> major difference appears. Only<lb/> ceramide induces a strong<lb/> accumulation of Beclin 1 (2.5 fold<lb/> higher than after S1P enhance-<lb/>ment, according to <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> of<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Lavieu et al. 3</ref> ). Because the inter-<lb/>action between Bcl-2 and Beclin 1<lb/> is required to maintain autophagy<lb/> in a physiological range, 9 it is tempting to speculate that the strong<lb/> increase of Beclin 1 induced by ceramide changes the ratio of Beclin<lb/> 1/Bcl-2 in a range incompatible with survival. Moreover, it was<lb/> shown by <ref type="biblio">Bektas et al. 10</ref> that the increase of SK activity is tightly<lb/> associated with the enhancement of Bcl-2 expression. This observa-<lb/>tion, in addition to the moderate accumulation of Beclin 1 after<lb/> SK1 overexpression seems to be compatible with the Bcl-2/Beclin 1<lb/> rheostat hypothesis. Does it mean that the autophagic response trig-<lb/>gered by S1P is gentler than ceramide-induced autophagy and com-<lb/>patible with cell survival? Interestingly, a fine analysis of the data from<lb/> Lavieu et al. 3 (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>), tends to support this suggestion, even<lb/> though the method used to induce autophagy by the two lipids is<lb/> different (treatment by exogenous short-chain ceramide for<lb/> ceramide-induced autophagy vs. enforced expression of SK1 for the<lb/> S1P-induced autophagy). The GFP-LC3 dot formation is lower in<lb/> the case of S1P-induced autophagy (approximately 1.6 fold lower<lb/> than after C2-ceramide treatment). The ceramide response seems to<lb/> be also faster than the S1P response (4 hours vs. at least one day).<lb/> However, this point would deserve further study by analyzing the<lb/> effect of ceramide and S1P on the interaction between Bcl-2 and<lb/> Beclin 1.<lb/></p> 

			<p>One of the major differences between the two responses is the<lb/> nature of the stress situation, since only S1P-induced autophagy<lb/> occurs after nutrient starvation. We have shown that starvation<lb/> induced both autophagy and an increase of SK activity. This last<lb/> point was equally observed in yeast suggesting a general role for SK<lb/> during the starvation response. 11 We have shown that the<lb/> knock-down of SK1 expression by siRNA inhibits starvation-<lb/>induced autophagy and increased cell death. For this reason we<lb/> proposed that S1P is a mediator of starvation-induced autophagy<lb/> which is now well established as a survival mechanism. 12<lb/> Surprisingly, the amount of endogenous ceramide during starvation<lb/> remained unchanged (from 15 min to 48 h) and the autophagic<lb/> response after inhibition of ceramide biosynthesis by FB1 treatment<lb/> was unaffected. These results suggest that ceramide is excluded from<lb/> the regulation of starvation-induced autophagy. Does it mean that<lb/> ceramide-induced autophagy and S1P-induced autophagy are<lb/> mutually exclusive responses? Study of enzymes that regulate the<lb/> balance between ceramide and S1P could be one of the ways to<lb/> resolve these questions.<lb/></p> 

			<p>While the above discussion deals with sphingolipids as second<lb/> messengers and their role in signal transduction, we should not forget<lb/> that these molecules are constituents of biological membranes and<lb/> that, because of their biophysical properties, modulate membrane<lb/> functions. For example it is now established that ceramide is respon-<lb/>sible for a negative curvature of the membrane. 13 Moreover, it was<lb/> shown that alteration of ceramide biosynthesis results in changes of<lb/> the vacuole morphology in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 14<lb/> Additionally, studies have described a change in SK1 localization,<lb/> which is usually cytosolic. For example, SK1 is recruited to the<lb/> nascent phagosome in human macrophages during the phagocytosis<lb/> of mycobacterium tuberculosis. 15 What is the significance of this<lb/> enzyme delocalization? Where is localized SK1 during autophagy? It<lb/> is an attractive possibility to contemplate that, in addition to its sig-<lb/>naling activity, ceramide and other lipids could play a structural role<lb/> in the autophagosome biogenesis. Progress in microscopy and the<lb/> development of fluorescent probes for sphingolipid trafficking<lb/> analysis need to be considered in order to identify the origin of the<lb/> autophagosome, an old and still unanswered question. 16<lb/></p>

An<lb/> increase of endogenous ceramide promotes a robust accumulation of Beclin 1 and an autophagic response<lb/> associated with cell death. An increase of S1P level (after starvation) induces a mild accumulation of Beclin 1 and<lb/> promotes cell survival by inhibiting the induction of apoptosis.</figure>
