			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The United States (US) has both the largest prison population, with over two million current<lb/> prisoners, and the highest incarceration rate in the world <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. Although the country has<lb/> recently started shifting away from more punitive and towards more rehabilitative forms of<lb/> criminal justice and recent legislation has successfully decreased incarceration rates <ref type="biblio">[2, 3]</ref>, a<lb/> substantial population remains incarcerated in prisons and jails in the US.<lb/></p>

			<p>California has the nation&apos;s second largest prison population. Following substantial popula-<lb/>tion growth in the 1980&apos;s and 1990&apos;s, California&apos;s prisons were characterized by extreme over-<lb/>crowding during the 2000&apos;s. Although California&apos;s prisons were not unique in this regard, the<lb/> circumstances surrounding its efforts to resolve the problem of overcrowding were. Two class<lb/> action lawsuits filed on behalf California state prisoners alleged that inadequate mental (Cole-<lb/>man v. Brown, filed 1990) and physical (Brown v. Plata, filed 2001) healthcare stemming from<lb/> overcrowded conditions violated prisoners&apos; constitutional rights. In connection with Brown v.<lb/> Plata, federal courts established a receivership with full authority over the state&apos;s prison health-<lb/>care system in 2006. Components of both lawsuits were ultimately consolidated before a single<lb/> three-judge court, which in 2009 declared overcrowding to be the primary reason for health-<lb/>care deficiencies and mandated the state to reduce its prison population by nearly 50,000 indi-<lb/>viduals, corresponding to approximately a 30% reduction. This order was upheld by the U.S.<lb/> Supreme Court in 2011 and California was required to meet the mandated reduction target<lb/> within three years of the ruling <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. To comply with the court&apos;s decision, California passed the<lb/> Public Safety Realignment Act (Assembly Bill [AB] 109) in October 2011.<lb/></p>

			<p>AB109 sought to decrease the prison population by prospectively shifting the custodial<lb/> responsibility of non-violent, non-serious, and non-sexual offenders from state prisons to<lb/> county jails and probation departments, which was motivated by the idea that local agencies<lb/> could do a better job of rehabilitating offenders <ref type="biblio">[5, 6]</ref>. In addition, by limiting the funds pro-<lb/>vided to counties for these additional inmates, the policy incentivized more cost-effective alter-<lb/>natives to incarceration, such as the use of day reporting centers, shorter post-release<lb/> community supervision, intensive probation, and home detention with GPS monitoring, with<lb/> the aim of lowering the overall rate of incarceration across both prisons and jails <ref type="biblio">[5, 6]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Empirical studies and policy analyses have examined the effects of AB109 on a variety of<lb/> outcomes, including state prison and county jail populations <ref type="biblio">[7-10]</ref>, recidivism <ref type="biblio">[7, 11-16]</ref>,<lb/> corrections spending <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>, and crime <ref type="biblio">[7, 8, 17-19]</ref>. Research suggests that AB109 significantly<lb/> reduced the state prison population and extent of overcrowding, though not enough to reach<lb/> the court-mandated target, while increasing the county jail population <ref type="biblio">[7-9, 11]</ref>. The increase<lb/> in the county jail population was smaller than the decrease in the state prison population,<lb/> resulting in a lower rate of incarceration overall. However, one study found that AB109 may<lb/> have exacerbated racial, ethnic, and gender disparities in incarceration in California&apos;s prison<lb/> system <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. AB109 appears to have led to modest increases in recidivism statewide, but<lb/> increases were smaller for counties that prioritized reentry programs <ref type="biblio">[7, 11-15]</ref>. As of 2015,<lb/> the policy appears to have had no effect on rates of violent crime, but may have increased rates<lb/> of property crime, particularly auto theft <ref type="biblio">[7, 8, 17-19]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the fact that AB109 was precipitated by inadequate healthcare in California prisons,<lb/> no independent studies have examined its effect on the health of prisoners. However, monthly<lb/> reports tracking a wide variety of healthcare performance indicators did document improve-<lb/>ments following the implementation of AB109 <ref type="biblio">[20, 21]</ref>. Indeed, in 2013, Governor Jerry<lb/> Brown of California declared that prison overcrowding no longer inhibited the delivery of<lb/> timely and effective healthcare to prisoners.<lb/></p>

			<p>AB109 was implemented amidst an evolving prison healthcare system in California, includ-<lb/>ing documented improvements under the federal receivership and the opening of a new medi-<lb/>cal complex that was constructed in 2013 in response to decisions in both the Plata and<lb/> Coleman cases <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. As such, it is not possible to isolate the effects of AB109 from those due to<lb/> other concurrent changes prompted by these lawsuits. However, given that overcrowding was<lb/> identified as the primary reason for California&apos;s inadequate prison healthcare <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>, it is plausible<lb/> that any changes in health outcomes over this period are at least partially attributable to the<lb/> de-crowding effects of AB109. Furthermore, the changes initiated by AB109 were unprece-<lb/>dented in state-level criminal justice reform, representing the largest ever court-ordered reduc-<lb/>tion of a prison population in the U.S. Indeed, AB109 has been characterized as &quot;the biggest<lb/> criminal justice experiment ever conducted in America&quot; <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. At the end of 2020, 10 states<lb/> exceeded at least one measure of prisoner capacity <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>. As these states continue to grapple<lb/> with overcrowded prisons and look to California&apos;s experience with AB109, it is critical that we<lb/> understand how the policy may have impacted all relevant outcomes, including prisoner<lb/> health.<lb/></p>

			<p>Leveraging several complementary data sources, we aimed to evaluate the effects of AB109<lb/> on California state prisoner mortality. By shifting the responsibility of low-level offenders to<lb/> county jails, AB109 impacted both the number of composition of prisoners in California state<lb/> prisons. Because of these dynamics, we also sought to assess the extent to which effects of<lb/> AB109 on prisoner mortality might be attributable contemporaneous changes in the age distri-<lb/>bution of prisoners.<lb/></p>

			<head>Materials and methods<lb/></head>

			<head>Overview<lb/></head>

			<p>To evaluate the effects of AB109 on California state prisoner mortality and assess the extent to<lb/> which changes in the age distribution may have contributed to these effects, we conducted<lb/> four complementary analyses. First, we evaluated the effects of AB109 on crude mortality (i.e.,<lb/> not accounting for temporal changes in age distribution) using the synthetic control method.<lb/> Second, we examined how the age distribution of California state prisoners changed following<lb/> AB109 and compared these changes to those occurring in other states over the same time-<lb/>frame. Third, we compared trends in crude and age-standardized mortality among California<lb/> state prisoners before and after AB109. Lastly, we compared pre-to post-AB109 changes in<lb/> mortality among California state prisoners to those occurring in other states while accounting<lb/> for differential changes in prisoner age distributions between states. This study was approved<lb/> by the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley<lb/> (Protocol Number 2018-09-11405) and granted a waiver of informed consent because it only<lb/> involved coded administrative data with no personal identifiers.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data sources<lb/></head>

			<p>To comprehensively answer our research question, we would ideally leverage data on the uni-<lb/>verse of state prisoners in the US, including their ages and dates of incarceration, as well as if<lb/> and when they died in prison. However, such comprehensive data were not obtainable.<lb/> Instead, we leveraged three complementary data sources that were either publicly available or<lb/> practically obtainable in order to conduct the four analyses outlined above.<lb/></p>

			<p>First, we obtained the annual counts of deaths and crude mortality rates among state pris-<lb/>oners for all 50 states for years 2001-2015 from publicly available reports published by the<lb/> Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) <ref type="biblio">[24, 25]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Next, we obtained individual-level state prison inmate term records for California and sev-<lb/>eral other states for years 2000-2015, including month and year of birth and prison term dates,<lb/> from the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>. Annually, the NCRP collects<lb/> offender-level administrative data on prison admissions and releases and yearend custody<lb/> populations from participating jurisdictions. The number of states submitting data to NCRP<lb/> has varied over time, with at least 38 states providing some amount of data since 2000. These<lb/> data were available from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research<lb/> under restricted conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lastly, we obtained de-identified individual-level data for all deaths among California state<lb/> prisoners, including age of the decedent and date of death, from the California Deaths in Cus-<lb/>tody (DIC) reporting program <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. The DIC Data includes all deaths that occur in law<lb/> enforcement custody. To capture deaths among California state prisoners, we retained only<lb/> deaths for which the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation had custody of<lb/> the subject immediately preceding death. We excluded decedents held in out-of-state correc-<lb/>tional facilities, those who died by execution, and those released on medical parole. These data<lb/> were publicly available through California Department of Justice&apos;s Open Justice program <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Collectively, these data sources provide us with or allow us to calculate crude annual mor-<lb/>tality rates for California and comparison states (BJS Data), annual total mortality counts for<lb/> California and comparison states (BJS Data), annual age-specific prisoner person-time for Cal-<lb/>ifornia and comparison states (NCRP Data), and annual age-specific mortality counts for Cali-<lb/>fornia only (DIC Data). Supplemental Table <ref type="table">1</ref> in S1 Appendix provides an overview as to<lb/> which components of these data sources were used in each of our four analyses.<lb/></p>

			<head>Crude mortality<lb/></head>

			<p>To evaluate the effect of AB109 on crude mortality, we used the synthetic control method with<lb/> the annual crude mortality rates from the BJS as the outcome variable <ref type="biblio">[29, 30]</ref>. Specifically, we<lb/> considered California as the single treated unit, and included other states in the donor pool<lb/> from which to construct the synthetic control. The synthetic control approach uses pre-policy<lb/> covariates and outcome data to identify a weighted combination of control units whose<lb/> weighted pre-policy covariates and outcomes best fit those of the treated unit. For our analysis,<lb/> the pre-policy period included years 2001-2010 and the post-policy period included years<lb/> 2012-2014. The year 2011 was excluded because AB109 was implemented in October 2011.<lb/> Years after 2014 were excluded because California implemented Proposition 47, another<lb/> major criminal justice law that reduced penalties for many low-level crimes, in November<lb/> 2014. The effect of AB109 on prisoner mortality is estimated by comparing the observed Cali-<lb/>fornia state prisoner mortality rate to that of the synthetic control unit in the post-policy<lb/> period. Full methodological details of this analysis are provided in S1 Appendix.<lb/></p>

			<head>Changes in prisoner age distributions<lb/></head>

			<p>In order to investigate the extent to which the effects of AB109 on crude mortality may be<lb/> attributable to changes in California&apos;s prisoner age distribution, we first sought to assess how<lb/> the age distribution of California state prisoners changed following AB109 relative to other<lb/> states over the same timeframe. If California experienced a change in age-distribution follow-<lb/>ing AB109 that was extreme relative to concurrent changes in other states, this would support<lb/> the plausibility that effects of AB109 on mortality could be attributable to a shift in the Califor-<lb/>nia&apos;s prisoner age-distribution. To do this, we calculated the proportion of prisoner person-<lb/>time corresponding to specific age groups (under 25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, over<lb/> 74) for 2010 and each year 2012-2014 for California and each comparison state. Prisoner per-<lb/>son-time was derived from the NCRP individual-level term records. Here, prisoner person-<lb/>time for a given year refers to the total number of days incarcerated among all individuals<lb/> incarcerated in that year; for example, if two prisoners were incarcerated in 2010, one for the<lb/> entire year (i.e. 365 days) and one for only 30 days, these two prisoners would represent 365<lb/> + 30 = 395 days of prisoner person-time in 2010. For each state and year, calculating the pro-<lb/>portion of prisoner person-time corresponding to specific age groups involved summing up<lb/> the incarcerated person-time among prisoners falling within each age group and dividing by<lb/> the total incarcerated person-time to obtain proportions. We then calculated the relative<lb/> change in each age group proportion from 2010 to each of the three post-policy years for each<lb/> state.<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparing crude and age-standardized mortality among California state<lb/> prisoners<lb/></head>

			<p>Next, we sought to investigate differences between the trend in crude California state prisoner<lb/> mortality and the trend in California state prisoner mortality that accounts for changes in the<lb/> age-distribution of prisoners over time and, particularly, following AB109. To do so, we com-<lb/>pared the annual crude mortality rates among California state prisoners from 2008-2014 to<lb/> annual age-standardized mortality rates over the same period, both calculated with death<lb/> counts from the DIC data and person-time measures from the individual-level NCRP data. To<lb/> calculate the annual age-standardize mortality rates, California&apos;s annual age-specific mortality<lb/> rates for each year from 2008-2014 were applied to the California state prisoner age-distribu-<lb/>tion from 2008, which preceded the implementation of AB109. This procedure is known as<lb/> direct standardization. The age-standardized mortality rates for each year were thus calculated<lb/> as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>l AS<lb/> CA;j ¼<lb/> X K<lb/> k¼1 l CA ;j;k pt CA;2008;k<lb/> X K<lb/> k¼1 pt CA;2008;k<lb/> for years j ¼ 2008; 2009; . . . ; 2014<lb/></formula>

			<p>Where λ AS<lb/> CA,j is the California age-standardized rate for year j; λ CA,j,k is the California mortal-<lb/>ity rate for year j and age group k; and pt CA,2008,k is the California incarcerated person-time for<lb/> 2008 and age group k. The age-standardized mortality trend illustrates how crude mortality<lb/> would have changed if the California state prisoner age-distribution were static from 2008 to<lb/> 2014. We were only able to standardize California&apos;s age-specific prisoner mortality rates in this<lb/> way because we had access to annual age-specific mortality rates for California but not for any<lb/> comparison states.<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparing age-standardized mortality between California and other states<lb/></head>

			<p>Lastly, we sought to evaluate the effects of AB109 on mortality net of any effect due to resultant<lb/> changes in the age distribution of California state prisoners and any secular trends approxi-<lb/>mated by the experience of other states. To do so, we compared California&apos;s change in state<lb/> prisoner mortality from pre-to post-policy years to that experienced by other states, while con-<lb/>trolling for differential changes in age distribution between California and other states over the<lb/> same period. Standard approaches to adjust for differential changes in age distribution<lb/> between California and other states would require that annual age specific mortality rates<lb/> among California and other states be compared directly or standardized to and summed over<lb/> the same age distribution, such as California&apos;s age distribution in a given year (i.e., direct stan-<lb/>dardization). However, as previously noted, the data available for this analysis precluded the<lb/> ability to calculate age-specific rates for any state but California and thus we could not evaluate<lb/> trends in age-adjusted mortality across states using the synthetic control method. We did,<lb/> however, have access to the annual age-specific person-time from the NCRP data and the total<lb/> number of deaths from the BJS data for comparison states.<lb/></p>

			<p>To compare mortality trends between California and other states while accounting for dif-<lb/>ferential changes in age distribution, this combination of data is amenable to an extension of<lb/> the method of indirect age standardization, in which a set of &quot;standard&quot; age-specific mortality<lb/> rates are standardized to and summed over a target age distribution to obtain the total number<lb/> or rate of deaths expected in the target population had it experienced the &quot;standard&quot; age-spe-<lb/>cific mortality rates. We calculated a single measure for each control state and post-policy year<lb/> that captured the excess (or deficit) change in mortality that would have occurred in the con-<lb/>trol state had it experienced California&apos;s age-group specific mortality rates in the pre-and rele-<lb/>vant post-policy year. Specifically, we used California&apos;s annual age-specific mortality rates as<lb/> the &quot;standard&quot; set of rates, which we standardized to and summed over the age distribution of<lb/> each control state for each corresponding year. Thus, for each control state, we obtained four<lb/> quantities that corresponded to the marginal mortality rate expected in each control state had<lb/> it experienced California&apos;s age-group specific mortality rates in 2010 and each year 2012-2014.<lb/> Then, for each control state and post-policy year, we calculated the difference between the<lb/> change in the expected marginal mortality rate from 2010 to a post-policy year and the change<lb/> in the control state&apos;s observed marginal mortality rate over the same period. Thus, the age-<lb/>adjusted excess mortality was calculated as:<lb/></p>

				<formula>EM i;j ¼<lb/> X K<lb/> k¼1 l CA;j;k pt i;j;k<lb/> X K<lb/> k¼1 pt i;j;k<lb/> À<lb/> X K<lb/> k¼1 l CA;2010;k pt i;2010;k<lb/> X K<lb/> i¼1 pt i;2010;k<lb/> 0<lb/> @<lb/> 1<lb/> A À CR i;j À CR i;2010<lb/> �<lb/> �<lb/></formula>

			<p>for comparison states i ¼ 1; . . . ; n and years j ¼ 2012; 2013; 2014<lb/></p>

			<p>Where EM i,j is the age-adjusted excess mortality for comparison state i and post-policy year j;<lb/> λ CA,j,k is the mortality rate for California in post-policy year j for age group k; pt i,j,k is the incar-<lb/>cerated person-time for comparison state i, post-policy year j, and age group k; and CR i,j is the<lb/> crude mortality rate for comparison state i and post-policy year j. A positive value for this<lb/> quantity suggests that the change in the marginal mortality rate associated with California&apos;s<lb/> pre-and post-policy age-specific mortality rates was greater than the change associated with<lb/> the control state&apos;s pre-and post-policy age-specific mortality rates, a negative value suggests<lb/> the opposite, and a value of zero suggests that there was no difference between the two. This<lb/> quantity can also be framed as a difference-in-differences estimate, for which California&apos;s age-<lb/>specific mortality rates applied to a control state&apos;s age distribution represent the treated unit<lb/> and the control states observed mortality rates represent the control unit.<lb/> For each post-policy year, we present the age-adjusted excess mortality rate estimates for<lb/> each control state, the median value, and exact confidence intervals. Exact confidence intervals<lb/> were obtained for the closest confidence levels above and below the 95% level via inversion of<lb/> the one-sample sign test. The sign test is a non-parametric statistical test that makes no distri-<lb/>butional assumptions about the underlying data distribution other than that data are drawn<lb/> independently from a continuous distribution.<lb/></p>

			<p>We also conducted a placebo test using 2008 as the pre-policy year and 2010 as the post-pol-<lb/>icy year and present the median and exact confidence intervals as described above. These years<lb/> were selected so as to skip a single &quot;implementation&quot; year as in the main analysis and because<lb/> 2010 is the last year prior to the actual implementation of AB109.<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparison states<lb/></head>

			<p>A full summary of comparison states included in the crude and age adjusted mortality analyses<lb/> and rationale for any exclusions are provided in S1 Appendix.<lb/></p>

			<head>Sensitivity analysis for differences in mortality reporting<lb/></head>

			<p>As previously described, our comparison of changes in age-standardized mortality rates<lb/> between California and other states leveraged multiple complementary datasets. There were<lb/> small differences between the annual number of deaths among California state prisoners in the<lb/> DIC and BJS data, with DIC data consistently reporting fewer deaths than the BJS data (Sup-<lb/>plemental Table <ref type="table">3</ref> in S1 Appendix). For the main analysis, we used the deaths present in the<lb/> DIC data. To account for the possibility that DIC data are not comprehensive and that the BJS<lb/> data represent the truth, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we added deaths to the<lb/> DIC data such that the annual number of deaths matched the number in the BJS data for 2010<lb/> and each post-policy year 2012-2014. Over 1000 iterations, we randomly assigned the added<lb/> deaths to different age groups (with equal probability), calculated the age-adjusted excess mor-<lb/>tality rate estimates for each state and post-policy year, and calculated the median value for<lb/> each post policy year. We then present the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the distributions of the<lb/> median values for each post-policy year.<lb/></p>

			<head>Bias analyses for concurrent policy changes<lb/></head>

			<p>Two sources of potential bias in estimating the effects of AB109 on California state prisoner<lb/> mortality are the nearly concurrent introduction of the medical parole program and the subse-<lb/>quent introduction of the elderly parole program in the California state prison system. The<lb/> medical parole program began in January 2011, granted its first parole in June 2011, and was<lb/> expanded in July 2014. This program initiated a parole hearing process that allowed grantees<lb/> who are permanently medically incapacitated and who require 24-hour care to be placed in a<lb/> licensed healthcare facility in the community. The elderly parole program began in October<lb/> 2014 and initiated a parole hearing process by which prisoners over 60 years old who have<lb/> served at least 25 years of continuous incarceration could be assessed for parole. An elderly<lb/> parole hearing differs from a standard parole hearing in that the panel gives special attention<lb/> to the prisoner&apos;s age, physical condition, and long-term confinement when determining a pris-<lb/>oner&apos;s suitability for parole.<lb/></p>

			<p>These two programs may have implications for our analysis because they were introduced<lb/> after the end of the pre-policy period and could have impacted the mortality rate among Cali-<lb/>fornia state prisoners if those granted parole through the programs were at systematically<lb/> higher or lower risk of death than those who remained incarcerated. If this were the case, any<lb/> changes in mortality in the post-policy period could be at least partially due to the initiation of<lb/> these parole programs.<lb/></p>

			<p>We sought to assess the impact of these parole programs on the results of our comparison<lb/> of age-standardized mortality rates between California and other states. It seems reasonable to<lb/> assume that medical parolees would be at greater risk of death than other age-comparable pris-<lb/>oners, and thus their release from custody may have resulted in a reduction in age-specific<lb/> prisoner mortality rates. However, two points are worth noting. First, medical parole differs<lb/> from compassionate release, which involves a recall of sentence for California state prisoners<lb/> who are terminally ill and are estimated to have less than six months to live. Although medical<lb/> parolees are permanently medically incapacitated, they are not necessarily terminally ill. Sec-<lb/>ond, there were never more than seven medical parole deaths during any post-policy year<lb/> (Supplemental Table <ref type="table">4</ref> in S1 Appendix), which represent a small fraction of the annual number<lb/> of deaths among California state prisoners. Regarding the elderly parole program, we have no<lb/> specific reason to expect elderly parolees to be more or less at risk of death than age-compara-<lb/>ble prisoners who remained incarcerated.<lb/></p>

			<p>To assess the sensitivity of our age-standardized analysis results to the introduction of the<lb/> medical parole program, we calculated age-standardized excess mortality rates as described<lb/> above but included deaths among California medical parolees and person time attributed<lb/> among these deceased medical parolees in the calculation of the age-specific annual California<lb/> mortality rates. Deaths among medical parolees were present in the DIC data and were<lb/> excluded from our main analysis. In addition, we re-ran the sensitivity analysis described<lb/> above to correct for differences in death counts between DIC and BJS data, but for each itera-<lb/>tion we added medical parolee deaths after updating the annual DIC death counts to match<lb/> those reported by BJS.<lb/></p>

			<p>Because the medical parole program began after the end of the pre-policy period, including<lb/> deaths among California medical parolees had no effect on the synthetic control fit for our<lb/> crude mortality analysis. Their inclusion increased California&apos;s observed mortality rate by<lb/> &lt;2% for each post-policy year and thus we do not present this sensitivity analysis for crude<lb/> mortality.<lb/></p>

			<p>To explore the potential impact of the elderly parole program on the California prison mor-<lb/>tality rate, we compared the trend in the mortality rate among California state prisoners aged<lb/> 60 and older before and after the start of the elderly parole program to the trend in rate among<lb/> prisoners younger than 60. Specifically, we calculated mortality rates separately among prison-<lb/>ers above and below age 60 for each calendar quarter in 2013 and 2014. Because the variance<lb/> of quarterly mortality rates among prisoners aged 60 and older were substantially larger than<lb/> those among prisoners under 60 (60 and older variance = 100,463; under 60 variance = 530),<lb/> we calculated the change in quarterly mortality rate since the rate in the first quarter (Q1) of<lb/> 2013 standardized by the standard deviation of quarterly rates in 2013-2014 for each group. If<lb/> the beginning of the elderly parole program led to a meaningful change in the mortality rate<lb/> among prisoners aged 60 and older, we might expect to observe a standardized change in the<lb/> mortality rate among this group in Q4 2014 that is not evident among prisoners under 60.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>
			<head>Crude mortality<lb/></head>

			<p>The composition of the synthetic California is presented in Supplemental Table <ref type="table">5</ref> in S1 Appen-<lb/>dix, the crude mortality rates for California and the synthetic California are presented in Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>,<lb/> and the difference between California&apos;s annual mortality rate and those for the synthetic Cali-<lb/>fornia are presented in Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Mortality among California state prisoners increased after the<lb/> implementation of AB109 in 2011 relative to those of the synthetic California, but the two<lb/> rates converged by 2014. These estimates suggest that, without accounting for age distribution<lb/> changes, the mortality rate among California state prisoners was higher in 2012 and 2013 than<lb/> would have been expected in the absence of AB109. Results of all permutation tests and robust-<lb/>ness checks are provided in S1 Appendix.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is worth noting that the 2012 crude mortality rate for California reported by the BJS is<lb/> and used in this analysis likely to over-estimate the true mortality rate (in deaths per person-<lb/>time). The BJS uses the year-end custody population as the denominator for calculating annual<lb/> rates, and AB109 led to a large and rapid reduction in the prison population that did not stabi-<lb/>lize until the end of 2012. Specifically, the yearend custody populations reported by BJS for<lb/> 2011 and 2012 were 147,051 and 132,624, respectively. As a result of this reduction from year-<lb/>end 2011 to yearend 2012, the yearend population will under-estimate the true incarcerated<lb/> person-time more in 2012 than in other years.<lb/></p>

			<head>Changes in prisoner age distributions<lb/></head>

			<p>After the implementation of AB109, the proportion of California state prisoners in older age<lb/> groups increased and those in lower age groups decreased (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>). From 2010 to 2012, Califor-<lb/>nia had relative increases in the proportion of prisoners in older age groups that exceeded<lb/> those of most control states with reliable person-time data (53% of control states for prisoners<lb/></p>

			<p>aged 45-54 and 100% of control states for prisoners aged 55-64, 65-74, and over 74). Simi-<lb/>larly, California had relative decreases in the proportion of prisoners for some younger age<lb/> groups that exceeded those of most control states (80% of control states for prisoners aged 35-<lb/>44; 100% of control states for prisoners aged 25-34; 33% of control states for prisoners aged<lb/> 18-24).

			<p>Both the crude and age-standardized mortality rates among California state prisoners from the<lb/> period 2008-2014 are presented in Fig <ref type="figure">4</ref>. The increase that was observed for crude mortality<lb/> rates following the implementation of AB109 is absent from the age-standardized mortality<lb/> rates. Whereas the crude mortality rate increased from 247.7 deaths per 100,000 person-years<lb/> in 2010 to 260.5 in 2012 and 266.0 in 2013, the age-standardized mortality rate decreased from<lb/> 223.9 in 2010 to 205.1 in 2012 and 202.9 in 2013. We also present the age-specific mortality<lb/> counts and rates among California state prisoners for each year from 2008 to 2014 in Supple-<lb/>mental Tables 6-7 in S1 Appendix. Age-specific mortality rates declined for all but two age<lb/> groups (under 25 and 45-54) from 2010 to 2012 and declined for all but one age group (under<lb/> 25) from 2010 to 2013 and 2014.<lb/></p>

			<p>The age-standardized excess mortality rate estimates for each state and post-policy year are<lb/> presented in Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref> and Supplemental Table <ref type="table">8</ref> in S1 Appendix. Among the 13 control states<lb/> included in the analysis, the median excess mortality rates were 7.9 (97.8% exact confidence<lb/> interval: -72.8, 37.3; 90.8% exact confidence interval: -35.5, 35.8) in 2012, -17.4 (-77.2, 43.5;<lb/></p>

			<p>-69.9, 14.1) in 2013, and -47.1 (-99.2, -27.5; -49.0, -29.3) in 2014. These results suggest that if<lb/> each control state&apos;s prison population had experienced California&apos;s age-specific mortality rates<lb/> from 2010 to 2014, they would have tended to have greater decreases in mortality relative to<lb/> what they actually experienced. By 2014, the median state would have experienced a nearly 50<lb/> fewer deaths per 100,000 prisoners, representing a nearly 20% reduction from the median<lb/> mortality rate of 259 per 100,000 among the 13 control states in that year.<lb/></p>

			<p>When applied to the pre-policy period (2008 to 2010), the median excess mortality rate was<lb/> 36.4 (-3.2, 108.6; 20.2, 84.4).

			<p>There was no evidence that the changes in crude mortality among states included in the<lb/> analysis arise from a different distribution than excluded states from 2010 to 2012 (p = 0.402),<lb/> 2013 (p = 0.806), or 2014 (p = 0.943), as assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>Following the implementation of AB109, California prisons experienced an increase in crude<lb/> mortality that attenuated by 2014 and appears to be attributable to a concurrent shift in the age<lb/> distribution of California state prisoners. When accounting for this change in the age distribu-<lb/>tion, California&apos;s change in mortality rate appeared consistent with those of other states in the<lb/> first two post-policy years but exhibited a greater reduction relative to other states in the third<lb/> year after implementation. This is the first study evaluating California state prisoner mortality<lb/> following the implementation of California&apos;s historic criminal justice initiative, and our analy-<lb/>sis suggests improved mortality outcomes three years after implementation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results of our synthetic control analysis suggest that the crude mortality among Califor-<lb/>nia state prisoners increased relative to what would have occurred in the absence of AB109,<lb/> with the largest increase occurring in 2012. This finding is supported by our permutation test<lb/> when restricting to control states with good pre-policy fits and our robustness checks. How-<lb/>ever, as previously noted, the crude mortality among California state prisoners that is reported<lb/> by BJS and used in this analysis over-estimates the true mortality rate in 2012, thus the magni-<lb/>tude of the effect in this year is likely exaggerated. Importantly, our age-focused analyses sug-<lb/>gest that this increase is attributable to a substantial shift in the age distribution of California<lb/> state prisoners as opposed to other mechanisms elevating prisoners&apos; mortality risk. We<lb/> explored this possibility in three ways.<lb/></p>

			<p>First, we found that California experienced a shift in age distribution among prisoners that<lb/> was more extreme than most comparison states, particularly in regards to increasing propor-<lb/>tions of older prisoners, following the implementation of AB109. AB109 provisions were<lb/> implemented prospectively such that that new low-level offenders would be incarcerated in<lb/> county jails instead of state prisons but existing state prisoners would not be transferred to<lb/> county jails or granted early release. Although both admissions and releases declined after<lb/> AB109, the reduction in California&apos;s prison population was driven by a decline in admissions<lb/> that exceeded the corresponding decline in releases. The rapid change in the age distribution<lb/> of California&apos;s prisoner population following AB109 aligns with the fact that that older prison-<lb/>ers are more likely to be serving longer sentences <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref>, such that prisoners released in a given<lb/> year are disproportionately younger than the overall prisoner population. Prior to AB109,<lb/> these releases would be approximately offset by new admissions, but new admissions were<lb/> reduced under AB109, a dynamic that resulted in a smaller and older prisoner population. It is<lb/> well established that mortality risk increases with age both in and out of prisons <ref type="biblio">[24, 32]</ref>, thus<lb/> it is plausible that the age-shift precipitated by AB109 could increase the crude mortality rates.<lb/></p>

			<p>Second, we found that the California state prisoner age-specific mortality rates actually<lb/> declined for nearly all age groups following the implementation of AB109. This is also reflected<lb/> in our finding that while the crude mortality rate increased from 2010 to 2012 and subse-<lb/>quently declined through 2014, the age-standardized rate declined over the entire period.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lastly, in our comparison of changes in age-standardized mortality rates between California<lb/> and other states, we found no evidence that changes in California age-specific mortality rates were<lb/> systematically different from those of 13 comparison states from 2010 to 2012 or 2013, but we did<lb/> find that California&apos;s age-specific rates decreased more than those of all but one comparison state<lb/> in 2014. Furthermore, we presented evidence that if each comparison state had experienced Cali-<lb/>fornia&apos;s age-specific mortality rates before and after AB109, the median state would have experi-<lb/>enced nearly 50 fewer deaths per 100,000 prisoners compared to what was actually observed, or<lb/> approximately 20% relative to the median 2014 mortality rate among comparison states.<lb/></p>

			<p>Taken together, our findings suggest that crude mortality increased among California state<lb/> prisoners following AB109 due to an evident change the age distribution and corresponding<lb/> risk profile of California&apos;s incarcerated population, but that mortality within age strata<lb/> declined both relative to the year before implementation and relative to contemporaneous<lb/> changes in other states. Understanding the overall (i.e. crude) mortality risk of the incarcerated<lb/> population is critical for surveillance and healthcare planning; however, to understand how<lb/> the de-population of California&apos;s state prisons under AB109 may have impacted the health of<lb/> individual prisoners, it is essential to account for the concurrent change in age distribution<lb/> and the corresponding mortality risk.<lb/></p>

			<p>The discrepant findings between our crude and age-adjusted analyses highlight an impor-<lb/>tant methodological consideration when studying trends or impacts of policies on population<lb/> measures. Specifically, researchers must take special care when applying methods and inter-<lb/>preting results when the internal composition of an aggregate population being studied may<lb/> change in a manner that impacts the outcome of intertest. In the present scenario, a careless<lb/> interpretation of the results of our synthetic control analysis might conclude that AB109<lb/> increased the mortality risk among California state prisoners, which our age-adjusted analyses<lb/> suggest is not the case. Importantly, any approach effectively accounting for such dynamics<lb/> requires data at a level more granular than crude population measures (e.g., individual-level<lb/> data or measures stratified by relevant covariates), which might not always be available.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is important to place our findings within the broader context of the California prison<lb/> healthcare system leading up to and following the implementation of AB109. As noted in the<lb/> Introduction, California&apos;s prison healthcare system has a unique and complex history dating<lb/> back decades from the implementation in AB109. Most notably, from 2006 through the end of<lb/> the study period, California&apos;s healthcare system was under full authority of a federal receiver<lb/> specifically tasked with improving the quality of care <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. From 2008 to 2010, both the crude<lb/> and age-standardized mortality rates among California state prisoners increased; in fact, when<lb/> calculating age-standardized excess mortality rates for this period, California appeared to have<lb/> a greater increase in age-specific mortality rates than comparison states. Despite these<lb/> increases in the early years of the receivership, a 2015 report by the receiver summarized sub-<lb/>stantial improvements to the structure, processes, and outcomes related to medical care in Cal-<lb/>ifornia prisons since 2008, though it also noted extensive variability in quality of care at the<lb/> institutional level <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Also, from 2006 to 2014, a comprehensive death review process docu-<lb/>mented a reduction in the rate of medically preventable deaths <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. In addition to these<lb/> changes that spanned the pre-and post-AB109 periods, the state opened the California Health<lb/> Care Facility (CHCF) in July 2013. The CHCF is a 54-building and nearly 3000-prisoner<lb/> capacity medical complex for prisoners with long-term medical or acute mental-health needs.<lb/> It is thus clear that the de-population of California prisons under AB109 occurred in tandem<lb/> with dedicated and seemingly effective efforts to improve the quality of medical care provided<lb/> to prisoners. Indeed, although the original court decision and subsequent Supreme Court<lb/> opinion for Coleman/Plata vs. Brown declared overcrowding as the primary reason for health-<lb/>care deficiencies, they also made clear that resolving overcrowding alone would not be suffi-<lb/>cient to improve the quality of care for prisoners.<lb/></p>

			<p>The changes that spanned or occurred during the post-policy period offer potential expla-<lb/>nations for why we only observed the reduction in age-adjusted prisoner mortality in 2014, the<lb/> third year after the implementation of AB109. Although the CHCF opened in July 2013, the<lb/> receiver halted intake in January 2014 citing inadequate staffing and supply chain issues that<lb/> precluded effective provision of healthcare at the facility <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. Following a series of improve-<lb/>ments, intake at CHCF resumed in July 2014 <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref>. Thus, after a challenging first 6-12 months<lb/> in operation, CHCF may have impacted system-wide mortality rates by admitting and provid-<lb/>ing care for prisoners with the most complex and severe medical needs in 2014. Indeed,<lb/> CHCF&apos;s average end-of-month population was 366 across all 12 months in 2013 and 1,620 in<lb/> 2014 <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>. In addition, the state&apos;s death review process determined that the rate of medically<lb/> preventable deaths was relatively stable from 2009 to 2013 but decreased by one-third in 2014,<lb/> which aligns with our findings <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. On the other hand, the average number of identified lapses<lb/> in care per prisoner death showed no meaningful trend prior to 2010 but decreased from 1.1<lb/> in 2010 to 0.8 in 2012-2013 and to 0.5 in 2014 <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>, which aligns with the timing of AB109<lb/> implementation. It is worth noting that death is the most severe health outcome and that<lb/> improvements in medical care are likely to impact intermediate health outcomes before ulti-<lb/>mately impacting mortality. This is particularly true in the context of chronic conditions such<lb/> as diabetes or hypertension, which require ongoing care and management and are more preva-<lb/>lent among incarcerated populations <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>. In addition, the decline in California&apos;s prison popu-<lb/>lation resulting from AB109 mostly occurred in the first year after implementation, stabilizing<lb/> around 133,000 inmates by September 2012 <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>. Accordingly, it seems plausible that de-popu-<lb/>lation under AB109, not fully realized until late 2012, could have facilitated subsequent<lb/> improvements in the quality of prisoner care that would correspond to the observed lag<lb/> between the implementation of AB109 and changes in mortality.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our study is novel in that it evaluates the impacts of decarceration on individuals who<lb/> remain incarcerated and that it focuses on a health outcome. Prior work has noted the poten-<lb/>tial for decarceration efforts to improve the health and well-being of prisoners by reducing<lb/> overcrowding and decreasing prisoner-to-staff ratios <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>; indeed, AB109 was predicated on<lb/> this idea <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. However, as illustrated by other research evaluating AB109 <ref type="biblio">[7, 8, 11-19]</ref>, out-<lb/>comes related to public safety and recidivism tend to receive more attention among efforts to<lb/> understand the impacts of decarceration. Our findings that AB109 may have decreased the<lb/> risk of mortality among California state prisoners provides an important complement to this<lb/> other work, and allows for a more comprehensive view of the impacts of AB109 and of decar-<lb/>ceration more broadly.<lb/></p>

			<p>The present study has several limitations. First, our synthetic control analysis and our age-<lb/>standardized excess mortality rate measures both rely on the assumption that the mortality<lb/> experience of other states can be used to approximate what would have occurred in California<lb/> in the absence of AB109, which is untestable. Second, we are unable to disentangle the mortal-<lb/>ity effects of de-population under AB109 and concurrent improvements in the quality of medi-<lb/>cal care in California&apos;s prisons that were prompted by the same lawsuits as AB109; however,<lb/> given that these were intended as concurrent and complementary strategies for improving<lb/> prisoner healthcare, we are not certain that it would be meaningful to do so. Third, only 29<lb/> and 13 control states were included in the crude and age-adjusted analyses, respectively; how-<lb/>ever, the majority of states were excluded due to small population sizes and numbers of pris-<lb/>oner deaths or having integrated prison and jail systems, which may limit their comparability<lb/> to California, which has the nation&apos;s second largest state prison system. In addition, among<lb/> states included in the crude mortality analysis, there was no difference in the distributions of<lb/> crude mortality trends between those that were included and excluded from the age-adjusted<lb/> analysis. Fourth, our age-adjusted analysis combines data from multiple sources, which<lb/> involved population data of variable quality in NCRP data and discordant counts of annual<lb/> deaths among California state prisoners in the BJS and DIC data. We sought to address the<lb/> variable quality in the NCRP data by validating year-end custody counts against NPS data and<lb/> only retaining states that exhibited reasonable quality over the entire study period. We sought<lb/> to address the discordant death counts in our stochastic sensitivity analysis, which had trivial<lb/> effects on our estimates and no impact on our conclusions. It is important to note that broader<lb/> availability of reliable data on US prison populations, including health-related measures,<lb/> would mitigate the majority of these limitations and improve the ability of researchers to rigor-<lb/>ously evaluate the impacts of changes to the nation&apos;s prison systems. Indeed, a study surveyed<lb/> 36 prominent publicly available health datasets and found the none could be used to assess the<lb/> health of incarcerated individuals, highlighting the dearth of these data <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite these limitations, we leveraged multiple data sources to examine mortality among<lb/> California state prisoners following a historic and unprecedented de-populating of a state<lb/> prison system. Although the crude mortality rate increased initially, our findings suggest this<lb/> was due to an expected shift in age distribution of California state prisoners. When accounting<lb/> for this shift in age distribution, we found that mortality decreased more in California relative<lb/> to comparison states three years after the implementation of AB109. As other states seek to<lb/> reduce their prison populations to address overcrowding and corresponding healthcare defi-<lb/>ciencies, any assessment of California&apos;s experience with AB109 should consider this potential<lb/> benefit.</p>
