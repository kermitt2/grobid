			<p>(-)-Colchicine (1, Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>) is one of the world&apos;s oldest<lb/> known medicines, dating back to at least ancient Egypt, when<lb/> its natural product source, the autumn crocus, was used for<lb/> treatment of inflammation. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> In more recent times, the pure<lb/> form of colchicine has been used as an FDA-approved drug<lb/> most closely associated with gout, but also used for prevention<lb/> of pericarditis and familial Mediterranean fever. <ref type="biblio">2</ref> There is also<lb/> growing interest in other applications. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> For example, the FDA<lb/> very recently approved colchicine for use in the prevention of<lb/> cardiovascular disease. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> Colchicine&apos;s broad value is generally<lb/> tied to its microtubule destabilizing activity, 5 which is the<lb/> mechanism through which many of the most important and<lb/> widely used chemotherapeutics work. While colchicine is not<lb/> currently used clinically as a chemotherapeutic due to its high<lb/> toxicity, there is high active interest in the development of<lb/> antiproliferative agents that target the colchicine-binding site of<lb/> tubulin. <ref type="biblio">6<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>(-)-Colchicine&apos;s tubulin-binding is directly related to its<lb/> axially chiral AC ring, which is thermodynamically set into the<lb/> preferred tubulin-binding aR (axial R) form by nearby S point<lb/> chirality on its 7-membered B ring. <ref type="biblio">7</ref> While (+)-colchicine,<lb/> which favors the aS form of the AC ring due to its alternative R<lb/> point chirality, is a substantially less potent tubulin inhibitor, <ref type="biblio">8<lb/></ref> the readily racemizable AC ring-bearing desacetamidocolchi-<lb/>cine (2, DAAC, Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>) <ref type="biblio">9</ref> and [2-methoxy-5-(2,3,4-<lb/>trimethoxyphenyl)-2,4,6-cycloheptatrien-1-one] (3, MTC, Fig-<lb/><ref type="figure">ure 1A</ref>) 10 each maintain potent tubulin-based antiproliferative<lb/> activity in line with (-)-colchicine. Given the importance of<lb/> the AC ring, there has been considerable interest in<lb/> understanding how its configuration influences both con-<lb/>formation and binding. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> However, with few exceptions, 12<lb/> biological studies on AC ring-containing analogs have relied on<lb/> semisynthetic derivatives of the natural product source. <ref type="biblio">13<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>Herein, we describe the de novo construction of several<lb/> structural intermediates between DAAC and MTC. These are<lb/> named Methyl on Tropone of MTC (MT-MTC, 4, Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">1B</ref>), Methyl on Benzene of MTC (MB-MTC, 5), and<lb/> DiMethyl MTC (DM-MTC, 6). These studies were enabled<lb/> by a recently described oxidopyrylium cycloaddition/reductive<lb/> ring-opening approach to methoxytropones. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> Through the<lb/> course of these studies, we identified a highly configurationally<lb/> stable AC ring analogue, (aR)-6, that has tubulin-inhibition<lb/> and antiproliferative activity despite a ground-state dihedral<lb/> angle and a steep energetic well that varies substantially from<lb/> AC dihedral angle binding of known colchicine analogs. <ref type="biblio">15<lb/></ref></p>

 			<head>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<lb/> </head>
				
			<p>Computational Modeling and Profiling of Torsional<lb/> Angles. The dynamics of the torsional angles of methylated<lb/> AC ring analogs 4-6 were studied computationally by carrying<lb/> out a relaxed coordinate scan with Schrodinger Suite&apos;s Jaguar<lb/> software. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> In these studies, an optimized geometry was<lb/> generated, and the dihedral angle χ was varied in an iterative<lb/> nature by 10°(Scheme <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). A full 360°beyond the first<lb/> coplanar orientation was scanned in order to establish a full<lb/> and iterative 0-360°window (Scheme <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Of note, the three<lb/> methoxy groups on the A ring did not reorganize during the<lb/> simulations due to their proximity, and this caused<lb/> enantiomers with different energies near the ground-states.<lb/> Thus, for ground-state profiling, the lowest energy of each<lb/> enantiomer was chosen as the most accurate ground-state for<lb/> each pose. These values are plotted from 0-180°in Scheme<lb/> <ref type="figure">1C</ref>. <ref type="biblio">17<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>The dihedral angle of the minimized structures for MTC (3)<lb/> was 129.1°, although profiling of its dihedral angle revealed an<lb/> energetically comparable pose at ∼50°(blue, Scheme <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).<lb/> This observation, as well as local energetic maxima at its planar<lb/> and perpendicular orientations, have been observed previ-<lb/>ously. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> A similar set of two near energetically equivalent local<lb/> minima were also observed for MB-MTC (5) at ∼120°and<lb/> 60°, shifted toward the perpendicular orientation (magenta,<lb/> Scheme <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). We consider these two energetic minima to<lb/> represent a &quot;colchicine-type&quot; pose (∼60°) and an &quot;isocolchi-<lb/>cine-type&quot; pose (∼120°), as they closely match the dihedral<lb/> angles of the AC ring in colchicine and isocolchicine,<lb/> respectively (see Scheme <ref type="figure">1A</ref> for reference and Scheme <ref type="figure">3E</ref><lb/> for structure of isocolchicine). MT-MTC (4), meanwhile, has<lb/> a more defined energetic minimum at 112.9°, and its<lb/> colchicine-type pose (∼60°) is roughly 2 kcal/mol uphill in<lb/> energy (green, Scheme <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). While 4 and 5 differ significantly<lb/> near their ground state, they share a similar barrier to<lb/></p>

			<p>enantiomerization (∼17 kcal/mol), which is significantly<lb/> higher than that of MTC (3, ΔG ‡ = 6.8 kcal/mol), but<lb/> below that of DAAC (2, ΔG ‡ = 22.1 kcal/mol). <ref type="biblio">19</ref> DM-MTC<lb/> (6) has a ground-state profile similar to MT-MTC (4) (red vs<lb/> green, Scheme <ref type="figure">1C</ref>), but it possesses a sharper energetic well<lb/> and a ground-state closer to a coplanar orientation (χ =<lb/> 101.1°). It also possesses a very high rotational barrier (ΔG ‡<lb/> calc<lb/> = 30.2 kcal/mol), which would place it at the frontier of class 3<lb/> atropisomer designation. The term &quot;class 3 atropisomer&quot;<lb/> describes molecules with rotational barriers of chiral axes<lb/> above 30 kcal/mol, and medicinal chemists generally view such<lb/> molecules as candidates for single atropisomer drug develop-<lb/>ment. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> This distinguishes them from compounds with<lb/> moderately stable chiral axes that are not good candidates<lb/> for single atropisomer drug development (ΔG ‡ = 22-30 kcal/<lb/> mol, &quot;class 2&quot;), and unstable chiral axes (ΔG ‡ &lt; 22 kcal/mol,<lb/> &quot;class 1&apos;). The implications to this are that if (aR)-6 is active, it<lb/> would have a narrow range of accessible dihedral angles that<lb/> are mostly distinct from those accessible for (-)-colchicine <ref type="biblio">18<lb/></ref> and could thereby alter its selectivity and physiochemical<lb/> properties. Given that the broad medicinal value of<lb/> (-)-colchicine is directly tied to this AC ring, the synthesis,<lb/> physical, and biochemical evaluation of 6 was warranted.<lb/></p>

			<p>Synthesis of AC Ring Analogs. Established methods for<lb/> synthesizing the AC ring of colchicine are almost exclusively<lb/> related to the natural product total synthesis 21 and are not<lb/> easily adaptable to analogs without a B ring. The only<lb/> established AC ring strategy that seemed viable for the<lb/> synthesis of 6 was an 11-step synthesis of a chloro-AC analog<lb/> reported over 30 years ago by Banwell. <ref type="biblio">12a</ref> We recently<lb/> described a convenient oxidopyrylium (5 + 2) cycloaddition/<lb/> reductive ring-opening approach to access methoxytropones<lb/> that could be used to generate the AC ring system. <ref type="biblio">14,22</ref> Using<lb/> this strategy, cycloadduct 18 was generated from alkyne 14 and<lb/> oxidopyrylium ylide dimer 12 and treated with samarium<lb/> iodide with an acidic aqueous workup (pH 3 phosphate<lb/> buffer). <ref type="biblio">23</ref> Excitingly, the only product observed was the AC<lb/> ring analogue iso-6 (Scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref>). iso-6 was viewed as a valuable<lb/> control molecule, as it has accessible torsional angles of the AC<lb/> ring more consistent with isocolchicine. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> It could also be<lb/> converted to 6 through demethylation followed by a<lb/> nonselective methylation, <ref type="biblio">25</ref> providing a separable mixture of<lb/> iso-6 and 6. By substituting alternative oxidopyrylium dimer 11<lb/> and/or alkyne <ref type="biblio">(13)</ref>, this route also provided additional analogs<lb/> 3, iso-4, 4 and 5. Of note, cycloaddition reactions with dimer<lb/> 11 was sluggish and low yielding, and required higher<lb/> temperatures that appears to produce a reaction-compromising<lb/></p>

			<p>dimer rearrangement. <ref type="biblio">26</ref> Fortunately for the present studies,<lb/> cycloadducts derived from 14 were only a single step from the<lb/> target molecules. It is worth noting that this lower reactivity<lb/> presently prevents a more direct route to 6 from oxidopyrylium<lb/> dimer 11 and an even less-reactive alkyne-methylated variant<lb/> of 14, but efforts are underway to address this limitation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Chiral Resolution, Characterization, and Configura-<lb/>tional Stability Studies. (aR)-6 and (aS)-6 were readily<lb/> separable from one another and racemic iso-6 through the use<lb/> of a polysaccharide-based chiral column (Diacel IA column) <ref type="biblio">27<lb/></ref> fitted to an automated medium-pressure liquid chromatog-<lb/>raphy unit (Biotage Isolera Prime). Racemization was<lb/> observable after heating a solution of either enantiopure<lb/> (aR)-or (aS)-6 at 135 °C in xylenes over a few hours, <ref type="biblio">16</ref> and<lb/> the rate of enantiomerization was extrapolated using the Eyring<lb/> equation (ΔG ‡ = 31.2 ± 0.3 kcal/mol). 28 (aR)-and (aS)-iso-6<lb/> were separable in an analogous fashion using a chiral IC<lb/> polysaccharide column. However, no racemization was<lb/> observed, even after heating to 145 °C for 10 h, at which<lb/> point decomposition was observed. Thus, we can project that<lb/> the rotational energy barrier is only 37 kcal/mol. However, a<lb/> computationally determined rotational barrier for iso-6 was<lb/> 33.5 kcal/mol, which is roughly 3 kcal/mol more than that<lb/> calculated for 6. One potential explanation for this notable<lb/> difference in configurational stability is the greater double<lb/> bond character of the methyl-bearing C 4 -C 5 carbon of iso-6 in<lb/> comparison to the C 5 -C 6 in 6, as this would both shorten and<lb/> rigidify this steric-bearing bond (see Scheme <ref type="figure">3A/B</ref> for details).<lb/> Evaluation of the lower-in-energy local maxima from the<lb/> torsional scan (χ = 170°) reveals that the smaller bond<lb/> distance of iso-6 (1.39 Å vs 1.48 Å) leads to a larger torsional<lb/> angle between the methyl and methoxy-bearing oxygens (blue,<lb/> χ 2 = 9.9°vs 6.9°) and smaller distance between the appendages<lb/> (2.60 vs 2.68 Å) (Scheme <ref type="figure">3C</ref>). Studies have previously<lb/> described differences in rotational barriers of DAAC (2) and<lb/> its analogous isomer that, while less dramatic, are consistent<lb/> with this trend (ΔG ‡ = 22.1 vs 23.4 kcal/mol). <ref type="biblio">18<lb/></ref> Absolute stereochemistry of (aR)-6, (aS)-6, (aR)-iso-6, and<lb/> (aS)-iso-6 were determined using VCD (Scheme <ref type="figure">3</ref>). 29 VCD is<lb/> a technique which evaluates CD spectra in the IR range and<lb/> can be used in combination with density functional theory-<lb/>based modeling to determine absolute stereochemistry and to<lb/> provide insight into conformations in solution. Molecular<lb/> modeling of both (aR) and (aS)-6 yielded 20 unique<lb/> conformations within 7 kcal/mol of one-another, each of<lb/> which underwent further DFT optimization at several levels of<lb/> theory to calculate VCD. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> Although many of the methods<lb/> gave computed VCD spectra that closely matched the<lb/> </p>

(±)-iso-6 was also isolated in 25% yield.<lb/> </figure>
				
			<p>experimental spectra, optimization at B3LYP/cc-pVTZ pro-<lb/>vided the best match, and in these studies, 6 conformers were<lb/> identified that contributed 1% or greater to the Boltzmann<lb/> weighted average. While most of the conformational flexibility<lb/> was coming from the methoxy groups, there was some small<lb/> variation of the dihedral angle defining the chiral axis (93-<lb/>100°), with 98.6°contributing to 60.5% of the spectra<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). A similar treatment was given to iso-6, with<lb/> the B3PW91/cc-pVTZ combination, this time yielding slightly<lb/> better results than the other methods. Unexpectedly, the VCD<lb/> spectra were considerably different from that of 6 on account<lb/> of the greater variation of dihedral angles of contributing<lb/> molecules (77-104°, Scheme <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). Most significantly, the<lb/> major contributor has a dihedral angle of 77.5°(55.5%<lb/> contribution share), whereas the second greatest contributor<lb/> has a vastly different dihedral angle of 103.8°(27.5%<lb/> contribution share). In DFT-based dihedral profiling (M06-<lb/>2X/6-311G**), iso-6 had two ground state minima�one at<lb/> 70°and one at 100°�consistent with these findings. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> These<lb/> two conformations are roughly equidistant from the<lb/> perpendicular conformation, and consequently, many of their<lb/> VCD peaks are equal to and opposite in signal strength,<lb/> weakening the observed signal.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given this unexpected difference, we wanted to gauge<lb/> whether the VCD spectra of colchicine and isocolchicine may<lb/> also provide evidence of larger differences in their conformers.<lb/> While a few VCD spectra of colchicine have been reported, <ref type="biblio">31<lb/></ref> we are unaware of any published VCD studies of isocolchicine,<lb/> and thus carried out studies on each (Scheme <ref type="figure">3D/E</ref>), as well<lb/> as their respective enantiomers. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> In these studies, both<lb/> colchicine and isocolchicine appeared to have very similar<lb/> ranges of dihedral angles in their VCD-contributing con-<lb/>formers. The only notable, major difference seemed to be in<lb/> the molecules&apos; ability to aggregate into dimers. The presence of<lb/> these aggregates made it necessary to model them and<lb/> combine these with the spectra from monomeric forms to<lb/> get consistent data. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> This aggregation is well-known with<lb/> colchicine, <ref type="biblio">32</ref> and in our studies the dimer contributed to<lb/> roughly 50% of the VCD spectra. On the other hand,<lb/> isocolchicine dimer aggregate only accounted for roughly<lb/> 12.5% of the VCD spectra, which appears to be due to<lb/> differences in ability to generate appropriate hydrogen bond<lb/> network. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> Regardless, the differences that were observed for 6<lb/> and iso-6 did not translate in any notable manner to the B-ring<lb/> containing AC rings.<lb/></p>

			<p>Biological Testing. The four atropisomeric compound-<lb/>s�(aR)-6, (aS)-6, (aR)-iso-6, and (aS)-iso-6)�were each<lb/> evaluated in the NCI 60 5-point screen. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> (aR)-6 showed<lb/> substantial growth suppression across various cell-lines at 10<lb/> μM (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>), with a mean GI 50 value of 2.4 μM, a<lb/> selectivity range of 2.39 log units, and total growth inhibition<lb/> (TGI) value of 63 μM. A distinct plateau at the TGI level of<lb/> analysis was also observed for (aR)-6, which is characteristic of<lb/> tubulin interactive agents. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> Meanwhile, (aS)-6 and (aR)-iso-6<lb/></p>

			<p>were not cytotoxic at the highest concentration tested (100<lb/> μM), and (aS)-iso-6 was approximately 10-fold less potent in<lb/> the NCI-60 screen than (aR)-6 (GI 50 , mean = 27 μM), with a<lb/> smaller selectivity range (1.46 log units) and TGI mean value<lb/> (91 μM). Growth inhibition of (aR)-6 was 10 to 50-fold less<lb/> potent than colchicine.<lb/></p>

			<p>The TGI level of responses for (aR)-6 and (aS)-iso-6 were<lb/> subsequently compared to known tubulin interactors using a<lb/> pattern recognition algorithm (COMPARE analysis, Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). <ref type="biblio">35</ref> Many of these known compounds had been tested at<lb/> multiple different high concentrations, and a single set of high<lb/> concentration tests was chosen for each compound, where it<lb/> displayed the most robust selectivity pattern. Notably, (aR)-6<lb/> showed a meaningful correlation (Pearson correlation &gt;0.5) to<lb/> (-)-colchicine, while (aS)-iso-6 fell short. However, a few<lb/> tubulin-targeting molecules had a significant correlation with<lb/> both molecules: the colchicine site binder centaureidin, the<lb/> vinca site binder dolastatin 10, and taxol. However, the closest<lb/> correlation was in fact between (aR)-6 and (aS)-iso-6,<lb/> supporting a shared mechanism of action. While several well-<lb/>established tubulin inhibitors did not have meaningful<lb/> correlations with either molecule, enough positive correlations<lb/> supported the testing of the compounds in biochemical assays.<lb/></p>

			<p>All of the AC ring-containing molecules synthesized were<lb/> subsequently tested for their ability to bind to tubulin (K d ) and<lb/> inhibit microtubule formation (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). MTC (3) had the<lb/> lowest binding constant of all compounds tested, and was the<lb/> only compound to inhibit microtubule polymerization at 3 μM.<lb/> Compounds 4, 5, and (aR)-6 had binding constants 5-30 fold<lb/> less potent than 3, but were each capable of inhibiting<lb/> microtubule polymerization at 33 μM. While iso-4 and (aS)-6<lb/> each appeared to bind to tubulin near the limits of the assays,<lb/> neither compound nor either enantiomer of iso-6 inhibited<lb/> microtubule polymerization at the concentrations tested.<lb/></p>

			<p>Growth inhibition studies were carried out with the library<lb/> against select cancer cell-lines, and this activity was tracked<lb/> closely with biochemical assays. Specifically, molecules that did<lb/> not inhibit microtubule polymerization did not have any<lb/> significant growth inhibition in cells, and the differences in<lb/> binding constants of active molecules tracked closely with<lb/> differences in growth inhibition (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). (-)-colchicine<lb/> was also tested as a control in cell-based assays, and showed<lb/> comparable activity to MTC (3), consistent with literature<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Representative Biological Results.

			<p>Computational Studies on AC Analog-Tubulin<lb/> Interaction. To glean additional insight into these differences<lb/> in activity, we turned to computational modeling of the library<lb/> in tubulin. Binding constants were calculated using the<lb/> alchemical Relative Binding Free Energy method (RBFE)<lb/> with the AToM-OpenMM software version v3.5.0 37 (https://<lb/> github.com/Gallicchio-Lab/AToM-OpenMM), and MTC (3)<lb/> was used as a reference. MTC and the other compounds were<lb/> aligned to the crystal structure of colchicine bound to tubulin<lb/> (PDB 5ITZ). <ref type="biblio">38</ref> Hamiltonian replica exchange alchemical<lb/> molecular dynamics calculations were performed with 22<lb/> replicas for 20 ns per replica, and 100 ns molecular dynamics<lb/> simulations for the dihedral angle analysis were conducted for<lb/> each compound bound to tubulin and free in solution. From<lb/> this data, we were able to extract a series of poses, through<lb/> which we could profile AC ring dihedral angles bound and<lb/> unbound (ie, Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>), and obtain computational binding<lb/> constants (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>What was immediately apparent from these studies was that<lb/> for tubulin-active molecules, modeling gave binding constants<lb/> within 5-fold of 3 (4, 5, and (aR)-6), while those that were<lb/> mostly inactive differed by at least 100-fold (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>).<lb/> Compounds 4 and 5 both bound to tubulin in silico with<lb/> dihedral angle profiles that were comparable to those of 3,<lb/> whereas (aR)-6 bound with much larger dihedral angles. When<lb/> unbound, each of the compounds had comparable average<lb/> dihedral angles that was near coplanar, but differed noticeably<lb/> in their distribution. Specifically, compound 3 had dihedral<lb/> angle distributions nearly uniformly from 50°to 130°, while<lb/> (aR)-6 was mostly in the 80°to 100°range (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). 4<lb/> profiled more similarly to (aR)-6, and 5 more similar to 3,<lb/> consistent with the energetic profiling results (see Scheme<lb/> <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). Thus, (aR)-6 has the smallest change in structure to<lb/> binding, illustrative of its high conformational rigidity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Looking more closely at the structures generated in silico,<lb/> two main hydrogen bond contacts are observed (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The most stable of these contacts is that between the oxygen of<lb/> the tropone carbonyl and the hydrogen of the amide backbone<lb/> of valine 181 (not shown). A second hydrogen bond is<lb/> observed between the thiol hydrogen of a highly flexible<lb/> cysteine 241 and the trimethoxybenzene-associated oxygen<lb/> atoms, and more specifically those of the methoxy groups at<lb/> the meta and/or para positions (illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). MTC<lb/> (3) shows consistent hydrogen bonding between this thiol and<lb/> at least one of these two trimethoxybenzene-associated<lb/> methoxy groups, whereas it is less frequent in the case of<lb/> (aR)-6. Given that the para methoxy groups are in line with<lb/> the AC chiral axes, the methoxy at the para position is not<lb/> influenced as much by the differences in dihedral angles as the<lb/> meta methoxy groups would be. This could help explain the<lb/> diminished potency of (aR)-6 as compared to 3 observed<lb/> experimentally. Regardless, the drastically different binding<lb/> pose of (aR)-6 to tubulin as compared to colchicine could<lb/> provide intriguing opportunities for studying dihedral influence<lb/> on tubulin inhibition, potentially even isotype selectivity, as<lb/> well as off-target effects.<lb/></p>

			<head>■ CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>A simple, deconstructed variant of DAAC (2), DM-MTC<lb/> ((aR)-6), is highly stable to epimerization with an<lb/> experimental energy barrier to inversion of 31.2 ± 0.3 kcal/<lb/> mol, nearly 10 kcal/mol higher than that of the B-ring<lb/> containing desacetomidocolchicine (2). Experimental and<lb/> computational studies demonstrate that (aR)-6 exists with a<lb/> torsional angle of its pharmacoactive AC ring of approximately<lb/> 100°, which is nearly 50°from how it exists in colchicine both<lb/> in the solution phase and when bound to tubulin. Despite this<lb/> difference, (aR)-6 still possesses cytotoxicity against many cell-<lb/>lines at low micromolar concentrations and is capable of<lb/> binding to tubulin and inhibiting microtubule polymerization.<lb/> Molecular dynamics studies suggest that (aR)-6 may prefer to<lb/> bind to tubulin with a dihedral angle at or around 80°, which<lb/> differentiates it from the 60°dihedral angle preferred 3, 4, and<lb/> 5 in similar modeling experiments.

			<p>General Information. All starting materials and reagents were<lb/> purchased from commercially available sources and used without<lb/> further purification except for CH 2 Cl 2 and benzene, which were<lb/> purified on a solvent purification system prior to the reaction. 1 H<lb/> NMR shifts are measured using the solvent residual peak as the<lb/> internal standard (CHCl 3 δ 7.26, D 2 O δ 4.79) and reported as<lb/> follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, bs = broad singlet, d =<lb/> doublet, t = triplet, dd = doublet of doublet, q = quartet, m =<lb/> multiplet), coupling constant (Hz), and integration. 13 C NMR shifts<lb/> are measured by using the solvent residual peak as the internal<lb/> standard (CDCl 3 δ 77.20) and reported as chemical shifts. Infrared<lb/> (IR) spectral bands are characterized as broad (br), strong (s),<lb/> medium (m), and weak (w). Microwave reactions were performed via<lb/> the Biotage Initiator 2.5 in a sealed vessel. Purification via reverse<lb/> phase column chromatography was performed on the Biotage Isolera<lb/> Prime, with Biotage SNAP 12 g cartridges, in a solvent system of<lb/> acetonitrile in water, each solvent containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic<lb/> acid (TFA). Oxidopyrilium dimers (11-12) <ref type="biblio">39</ref> alkyne 13, cyclo-<lb/>adducts 15 and 16, and methoxytropones 3, 4 and iso-4 were<lb/> synthesized as previously reported. <ref type="biblio">14<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>DFT Calculations. General Information for DFT Calculations.<lb/> Computational modeling was carried out using Schrodinger Suite&apos;s<lb/> Jaguar software. Unless otherwise noted, all calculations were<lb/> performed using the M06-2X functional and the 6-311G** basis<lb/> set in the gas phase at room temperature (298.15 K). This functional<lb/> and basis set was chosen for its cited accuracy for both conformational<lb/> and energetic accuracy. <ref type="biblio">40<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>Torsional Angle Profiling. AC ring structures (3-6) were<lb/> submitted to a geometry optimization to provide a preliminary<lb/> ground-state conformation. These structures were used to determine<lb/> ground state dihedral angles provided in Scheme <ref type="figure">1A</ref>. These were then<lb/> submitted to a relaxed coordination scan of dihedral χ in increments<lb/> of 10°, scanned in an iterative rather than simultaneous fashion by<lb/> selecting &quot;previously optimized geometry&quot;, to a final dihedral angle of<lb/> ˈ540°′. This was done in order to obtain a full and iterative 360°w<lb/> indow for each compound (180-540°), and this full window is<lb/> provided in Scheme <ref type="figure">1B</ref>, adjusted to -180°to 180°, and plotted<lb/> against change in energy (kcal/mol). Additional details can be found<lb/> in the Supporting Information file.<lb/></p>

			<p>Free Energy Barrier Determination. Free energy barriers were<lb/> determined as follows. Single point energy, including vibrational<lb/> frequency measurements, were obtained for each molecules&apos; global<lb/> minima and 2 local maxima. In each case, none of the minima (ie,<lb/> GS) had a vibrational frequency, while all of the local maxima (ie, TS)<lb/> had a single negative frequency, and these values are included in the<lb/> Supporting Information. A folder of compiled text files of Cartesian<lb/> coordinates (xyz) from these computations is provided in a separate<lb/> zip file as a unique Supporting Information file. Expected &quot;observed&quot;<lb/> free energies were extrapolated from these values, and additional<lb/> details on these computations can be found in the main Supporting<lb/> Information document.<lb/></p>

			<p>Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD). VCD Measurements.<lb/> CDCl 3 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Silver Foil) was run through<lb/> a small plug of activated basic alumina immediately before use. To a<lb/> small vial containing ∼ 7 mg of chiral molecule ((aR)-6, (aS)-6, (aR)-<lb/>iso-6, (aS)-iso-6, (-)-colchicine or (aR)-isocolchicine) was added 150<lb/> μL of CDCl 3 . The resulting solution was transferred to a liquid IR cell<lb/> (BaF 2 , 100 μm cell path) and placed in the measurement chamber.<lb/> Experimental spectra were acquired on a BioTools, Inc. (Jupiter, FL)<lb/> ChiralIR 2X Dual PEM FT-VCD spectrometer, set to 4 cm -1<lb/> resolution, with PEM (both 1 and 2) maximum frequency set to<lb/> 1400 cm -1 . The sample was then measured for 6 to 8 h in 1 h blocks.<lb/> The IR data from the first block was solvent and water vapor<lb/> subtracted, then offset to zero at 2000 cm -1 . The VCD data blocks<lb/> were averaged, and enantiomer subtracted ((E1-E2)/2). Finally, the<lb/> VCD spectrum was offset to zero at 2000 cm -1 . The VCD noise data<lb/> were block averaged and used without further processing.<lb/></p>

			<p>VCD Calculations. The aR enantiomer of each compound (6, iso-6,<lb/> colchicine and isocolchicine) were constructed (separately) using<lb/> ComputeVOA (BioTools, Jupiter, FL). A thorough conformational<lb/> search was performed for each at the molecular mechanics level using<lb/> the MMF94 force field in a 7 kcal/mol energy window. All<lb/> conformers were subjected to DFT level optimization and frequency<lb/> calculation with Gaussian &apos;09 (Wallingford, CT) <ref type="biblio">41</ref> at the B3LYP/6-<lb/>31G(d) and B3PW91/6-31G(d) levels. <ref type="biblio">42</ref> The resulting lowest energy<lb/> unique conformations were reoptimized using the cc-pVTZ/B3LYP<lb/> and cc-pVTZ/B3PW91 method, 42b and the IR and VCD frequencies<lb/> recalculated at these levels. The resulting spectra from all methods<lb/> were Boltzmann averaged (using both free energy and electronic<lb/> energy), plotted at 5 cm -1 resolution, and then x-axis scaled (range of<lb/> 0.968 to 0.985-values obtained using CompareVOA (BioTools,<lb/> Jupiter, FL) and varied with basis set and functional) for comparison<lb/> to the experimental IR and VCD spectra. Two different weighing<lb/> methods (free energy and electronic energy) gave consistent results<lb/> for stereochemistry, with the larger cc-pVTZ basis set and electronic<lb/> energy weighting giving results most similar to those of the<lb/> experimental IR and VCD. These were ultimately used for similarity<lb/> values and plots. The excellent visual agreement and high similarity<lb/> values (IR and VCD) as well as confidence level 30 for both 6 and iso-6<lb/> leaves no doubt that the absolute configuration has been correctly<lb/> assigned.<lb/></p>

			<p>Bioactivity Methods for Colchicine AC Analogs. Binding<lb/> Affinity. Binding affinity to the colchicine site of bovine brain tubulin<lb/> (PurSolutions, LLC (puresoluble.com)) was assayed by competition<lb/> of test compounds with MDL ((E)-1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-[4-<lb/>(dimethylamino)phenyl]-2-methylprop-2-en-1-one) as described pre-<lb/>viously. <ref type="biblio">43</ref> MDL fluorescence increases many-fold upon binding to the<lb/> colchicine site of tubulin. Inhibition of this fluorescence increase was<lb/> measured and converted to K d for the test compound as described.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tubulin Polymerization Inhibition. Inhibition of tubulin polymer-<lb/>ization was determined as described previously. <ref type="biblio">44</ref> In brief, 10 μM<lb/> bovine brain tubulin (PurSolutions, LLC (puresoluble.com)) was<lb/> incubated under conditions strongly promoting polymerization of<lb/> tubulin (1 M NaGlutamate, 0.1 M Mes (Morpholinoethanesulfonic<lb/> acid), 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM GTP, pH 6.9), in the absence or<lb/> presence of 3.3 or 33 μM test compound, incubated for 30 min at 37<lb/> °C, then centrifuged at 100,000g for 8 min, and the top 3/4 of the<lb/> supernatant removed. Protein concentration was measured, and<lb/> polymerization was determined as pelletable protein lost from the<lb/> supernatant.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cell-Growth Inhibition Studies. Inhibition of cell growth was<lb/> determined by using standard procedures. Cell lines were obtained<lb/> from the NCI anticancer drug screen and maintained in DMEM<lb/> medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Growing cells<lb/> were exposed to serial dilutions of each compound for 3 days. Cell<lb/> growth was determined with CellTiter Assay Reagent (Promega), and<lb/> growth parameters, including inhibition of growth, were measured by<lb/> using the methods specified by the manufacturer.<lb/></p>

			<p>60-Cell Screen. (aR)-6, (aS)-6, (aS)-iso-6, and (aR)-iso-6 were<lb/> submitted to the 60 Cell Screen panel and evaluated at 5 doses (100<lb/> μM, 10 μM, 1 μM, 0.1 μM, and 0.01 μM). A summary of the data for<lb/> all molecules is in Table <ref type="table">S5</ref> in the Supporting Information document,<lb/> and a compilation of GI 50 values of active compounds determined<lb/> from these studies along with prior experiment of colchicine is listed<lb/> in Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>. The complete report from this submission is available at<lb/> the publisher&apos;s Web site as a separate Supporting Information file. For<lb/> COMPARE analysis, TGI levels of response for (aR)-DM-MTC (6)<lb/> and (aS)-iso-DM-MTC were compared to those of several established<lb/> tubulin inhibitors previously tested in the NCI-60 screen. A complete<lb/> list of these data can be viewed in Table <ref type="table">S7</ref> in the Supporting<lb/> Information document.<lb/></p>

			<p>Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The molecular dynamics<lb/> relative binding free energy calculations <ref type="biblio">37</ref> were conducted using the<lb/> AToM-OpenMM package version 3.5.0 45 and the ATM MetaForce<lb/> OpenMM plugin version 0.3.5 <ref type="biblio">46</ref> and the OpenMM MD engine<lb/> version 8.0. <ref type="biblio">47</ref> We used the 5ITZ PDB structure of the tubulin dimer<lb/> bound to colchicine. <ref type="biblio">38</ref> The AMBER&apos;s FF14SB force field <ref type="biblio">48</ref> was used<lb/> for the protein receptor, and the TIP3P model was used for the water<lb/> solvent. The GAFF force field was used for parametrizing ligands.<lb/> Starting with the protein receptor and each ligand pair aligned in the<lb/> protein binding site, the second ligand in the pair was translated by<lb/> the displacement vector. The system was then solvated within a<lb/> rectangle box with a 10 Å TIP3P water buffer by tleap from<lb/> AmberTools. Potassium and chloride ions were added to neutralize<lb/> the system, if needed. Relative binding free energy calculations<lb/> employed 22 alchemical replicas, each simulated for 40 ns. Additional<lb/> molecular dynamics runs of the complexes to collect the dihedral<lb/> angle probability distributions were run for 100 ns. <ref type="biblio">49</ref></p>
