			<p>Cancer is very dangerous disease with uncontrolled growth<lb/> and rapid spreading of abnormal cells <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. Several external<lb/> and internal factors are caused to abnormal growth of cell<lb/> lines and induced the different cancers <ref type="biblio">[2-7]</ref>. Currently, three<lb/> types of treatment are available for cancer disease including<lb/> chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. The standard<lb/> treatment for cancer patients is chemotherapy, in which dif-<lb/>ferent chemotherapeutic agents are used to kill the cancer<lb/> cells without any harmful effective on normal kidney cells<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[9-13]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nitrogen atoms contain heterocyclic ring moieties that are<lb/> present both in natural products and in synthetic derivatives<lb/> and exhibited potent anticancer activities against different<lb/> human cancer cell lines <ref type="biblio">[14-32]</ref>. Three nitrogen atoms con-<lb/>taining heterocyclic ring such as 1,2,4-triazoles play an<lb/> important critical role in the structural elucidation of various<lb/> natural products <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref> and are able to form hydrogen bonding<lb/> with suitable targets leading to improving of pharmacokinet-<lb/>ics, pharmacological, and toxicological properties <ref type="biblio">[34, 35]</ref>.<lb/> These 1,2,4-triazole derivatives are associated with different<lb/> pharmaceutical activities such as anticancer <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>, antibacte-<lb/>rial <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>, antitubercular <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>, antifungal <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>, antiviral <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>,<lb/> analgesic <ref type="biblio">[41]</ref>, anti-inflammatory <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref>, and tubulin inhibitors<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[43]</ref>. Letrozole (1, Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) <ref type="biblio">[44, 45]</ref> is a triazole structural unit<lb/> containing aromatase inhibitor and is used for cancer treat-<lb/>ment.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles are considered as most sig-<lb/>nificant subclass of bioactive five-membered organic com-<lb/>pounds for medicinal chemistry <ref type="biblio">[46]</ref> and showed a remark-<lb/>able biological activities such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[47]</ref>, human leukemia <ref type="biblio">[48]</ref>, antibacterial <ref type="biblio">[49]</ref>, antiulcerative<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[50]</ref>, antihypertensive <ref type="biblio">[51]</ref>, cathepsin B inhibitors <ref type="biblio">[52]</ref>, anti-<lb/>convulsant <ref type="biblio">[53]</ref>, antidiabetic <ref type="biblio">[54]</ref>, anti-inflammatory <ref type="biblio">[47]</ref>,<lb/> and allosteric modulators <ref type="biblio">[55]</ref>. One of the anticancer drug<lb/> scaffolds like 3,5-bis(pyridin-3-yl)-1,2,4-thiadiazole (2) is<lb/> inhibitor of aromatase and used for treatment of various types<lb/> of cancers <ref type="biblio">[56, 57]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 1 Structures of letrozole (1)<lb/> and 3,5-bis(pyridine-3-yl)-1,2,4-<lb/>thiadiazole<lb/> (2)<lb/></figure>

			<p>Previously, we reported the synthesis of a library of<lb/> novel<lb/> 2-(4-arylsubstituted-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-N-{4-<lb/>[2-(thiazol-2-yl)benzo[d]thiazol-6-yl]phenyl}acetamide<lb/> derivatives and screened their anticancer activities against<lb/> MCF-7, A549, Colo-205, and A2780 cell lines with etopo-<lb/>side as standard drug. The anticancer target compounds<lb/> reported by us and the literature reveal hazardous sol-<lb/>vent usage, harsh reaction conditions, and longer reaction<lb/> sequences. To overcome the above drawbacks and inspired by<lb/> special features of both 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-oxadiaxole,<lb/> we have to design and synthesize new amide functionality<lb/> bearing 1,2,4-thiadiazole-1,2,4-triazole derivatives (8a-j).<lb/> These derivatives were examined for their anticancer activi-<lb/>ties against four different human cancer cell lines like breast<lb/> cancer (MCF-7, MDA MB-231), lung cancer (A549), and<lb/> prostate cancer (DU-145). These derivatives may act as drug<lb/> lead molecules in cancer chemotherapy.<lb/></p>

			<p>All the solvents, salts, reagents, and fine chemicals were<lb/> purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Alfa Aesar companies.<lb/> These chemical items were used without further purification.<lb/> 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded with 400 MHz and<lb/> 300 MHz frequency Gemini Varian-VXR-unity instruments.<lb/> Chemical shifts (δ) were noted in ppm toward downfield with<lb/> respect to tetramethylsilane as internal standard. ESI spectra<lb/> were recorded at 3.98 kV capillary voltages with micro-mass,<lb/> Quattro LC instrument using ESI + software. Melting points<lb/> were noted with the help of electrothermal melting point<lb/> apparatus.<lb/></p>

The ESI-MS peak at m/z 326 [M + H] + confirmed the<lb/> structure of compound 5. The triazole compound 5 reacted<lb/> with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzamidine (3) in the presence of<lb/> potassium phosphate tribasic trihydrate (K 3 PO 4 •3H 2 O) base,<lb/> and sulfur in DMSO solvent was heated at 130 °C for<lb/> 12 h to afford pure 1,2,4-thiadiazole intermediate 6. The<lb/> ESI-MS peak at m/z 562 [M + H] + confirmed the structure<lb/> of compound 6. Then, this intermediate 5 was coupled with<lb/> substituted aromatic acid chlorides (7a-j) in the presence<lb/> of Cs 2 CO 3 base in anhydrous acetonitrile solvent at room<lb/> temperature for 12 h to afford the 1,2,4-thiadiazole-1,2,4-<lb/>triazole derivatives 8a-j.

			<p>1.98 ± 0.22 μM, MDA MB-231 2.33 ± 1.52 μM, and<lb/> MCF-7 1.44 ± 0.17 μM; A549 2.10 ± 1.44 μM; DU145<lb/> 2.76 ± 1.88 μM, MDA MB-231 2.35 ± 1.51 μM, when<lb/> compared with 8b compound. The replacement of 4-methoxy<lb/> group with 4-nitro (8e) showed improved anticancer activity<lb/> against four cell lines (MCF-7 0.23 ± 0.014 μM; A549<lb/> 1.64 ± 0.53 μM; DU145<lb/> 0.19 ± 0.011 μM, MDA MB-<lb/>231<lb/> 1.55 ± 0.63 μM) compared with 8d. Replacement<lb/> of 4-nitro substituent with 4-chloro and then the compound<lb/> 8g showed acceptable activity (MCF-7 1.02 ± 0.65 μM;<lb/> A549<lb/> 1.69 ± 0.13 μM; DU145<lb/> 2.13 ± 1.98 μM,<lb/> MDA MB-231 2.15 ± 1.08 μM). When 3,5-dinitro group<lb/> was introduced, 4-bromo substituents on the phenyl ring<lb/> resulted compounds, namely 8f and 8h, were displayed<lb/> very poor activity on all cell lines. Interestingly, compound<lb/> 8i with 4-cyano electron-withdrawing group showed bet-<lb/>ter anticancer activity (MCF-7 1.27 ± 0.92 μM; A549<lb/> 1.90 ± 0.46 μM; DU145<lb/> 0.60 ± 0.014 μM, MDA MB-<lb/>231 1.59 ± 0.37 μM) than 8g. Compound 8j with weak<lb/> electron-donating group on the phenyl ring demonstrated<lb/> moderate activity.<lb/></p>

			<p>From the structure-activity relationship studies, it can<lb/> be concluded that the presence of three electron-donating<lb/> -OCH 3 group at 3,4,5 positions on phenyl ring displayed<lb/> excellent potent anticancer activities against four specified<lb/> cancer cell lines. The decrease in anticancer activity would<lb/> be observed with two -OCH 3 groups at 3,5 positions and<lb/> one -OCH 3 group at 4th position. The presence of strong-<lb/>withdrawing group -NO 2 at 3, 5 positions on phenyl ring<lb/> displayed very less anticancer activity against specified can-<lb/>cer cell lines, when compared to one -NO 2 group at 4th<lb/> position. In this series, cytotoxicity effect decreases from<lb/> the electron-donating group to electron-withdrawing group<lb/> derivatives.<lb/></p>

			<head>4 Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>The new library of 1,2,4-thiadiazole-1,2,4-triazole deriva-<lb/>tives having amide functionality (8a-j) was designed, syn-<lb/>thesized, and examined for their anticancer activities against<lb/> four different human cancer cell lines including breast cancer<lb/> (MCF-7, MDA MB-231), lung cancer (A549), and prostate<lb/> cancer (DU-145) by making use of MTT assay. Here, Etopo-<lb/>side acts as standard drug, and the obtained results were<lb/> presented as IC 50 (μM) values. The results indicated that<lb/> most of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate to<lb/> excellent anticancer activity aligned with four cell lines.<lb/> Among them, compounds 8b, 8c, 8d, 8e, 8g, and 8i dis-<lb/>played more potent activity with IC 50 values ranging from<lb/> 0.10 ± 0.084 to 11.5 ± 6.49 μM and standard showed IC 50<lb/> value ranges from 1.91 ± 0.84 μM to 3.08± 0.135 μM.<lb/> These derivatives may act as drug lead molecules in cancer<lb/> chemotherapy.</p>
