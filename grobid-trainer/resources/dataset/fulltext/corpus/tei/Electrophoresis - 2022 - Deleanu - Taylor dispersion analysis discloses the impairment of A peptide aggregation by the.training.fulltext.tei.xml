			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathol-<lb/>ogy inducing damage to the patient&apos;s brain and translating<lb/> in memory loss and behavioural impairment. One of the<lb/> main hallmarks of AD is the presence of amyloid β peptide<lb/> (Aβ) plaques in the brain of patients and several evidence<lb/> points that Aβ peptides are one of the main reasons behind<lb/> the symptoms of AD either in its oligomeric form (thought<lb/> to be neurotoxic) <ref type="biblio">[1, 2]</ref> or in its fibrillary form <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In all cases, there is a necessity to better understand<lb/> the aggregation mechanism of Aβ peptides. However in<lb/> vitro studies are often hampered by the detection limits<lb/> of the used methods which often impose the use of con-<lb/>centrations (µM range) several tens of times higher than<lb/> the in vivo ones (nM range <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>). Studying the aggregation<lb/> process of amyloid peptides in detail is a challenging task<lb/> especially at concentrations in the order of magnitude of<lb/> physiological ones. For that, the use of selective and sensi-<lb/>tive detection methods such as fluorescence-based ones is<lb/> highly desirable to study peptides at lower concentrations<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. This strategy implies a modification of the peptide<lb/> structure by adding a label often on its N-terminal end.<lb/> However, the attached tag may affect the physical and<lb/> chemical properties of the amyloid peptides <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> and their<lb/> propensity to form beta-sheets and thus fibrillar structures.<lb/> Wägele et al. <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref> studied, by fluorescence correlation spec-<lb/>troscopy (FCS), the effect of four fluorescent tags (HiLyte<lb/> 647, HiLyte 488, Atto 655 and Atto 488) on the oligomer dis-<lb/>tribution of both Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42). They concluded<lb/> that HiLyte 647 and Atto 655, compared to the other two<lb/> tags, had high peptide-tag interactions which promoted<lb/> the formation of the high molecular weight oligomers<lb/> of Aβ(1-40) and consequently the fibrillation step. In<lb/> this experiment, Atto 488 seemed to be the most suitable<lb/> as no significant interaction was noted. Quinn et al.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref> demonstrated that HiLyte Fluor 555-labelling of Aβ<lb/> peptides on its N-terminus did not alter the self-assembly<lb/> kinetics or the resulting aggregated structures. On the<lb/> contrary, Taverna et al. demonstrated that a fluorescent tag<lb/> (FluoProbes 488 NHS Ester) attached on a side-chain of<lb/> amyloid Aβ(1-42) (on the amines of Lys-16, Lys-28 and/or<lb/> N-terminus Asp residues) inhibited the aggregation <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. In<lb/> another study by Zheng et al. <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>, the effect of five different<lb/> dyes introduced in the form of N-hydroxysuccinimidyl<lb/> esters (BP, RB and 5-SFX) or as isothiocyanates (RITC and<lb/> 5-(6)-FITC [fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate]) was evaluated.<lb/> The authors concluded that 5-SFX and 5-(6)-FITC inhib-<lb/>ited the aggregation, as no change in the R h was observed<lb/> during the incubation period of 4 h, whereas the other<lb/> three promoted it. However, this study showed limitations<lb/> as a concentration of 5 µM in peptide was used and the<lb/> aggregation was monitored for only few hours at 25 • C.<lb/> Under these conditions, the aggregation of the Aβ peptides<lb/> would take a few days (even weeks) <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref> to start, and it<lb/> seems difficult to judge on the inhibition effect of these<lb/> dyes. In our opinion, in order to study the aggregation<lb/> process of amyloid peptides at relevant physiological<lb/> concentrations, one might consider the use of preformed<lb/> seeds known to accelerate the aggregation process at such<lb/> low concentrations <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. Even though, when labelled pep-<lb/>tides are used, it is important to understand if the attached<lb/> label is not introducing a bias in the aggregation process.<lb/></p>

			<p>Amyloid peptides exist under different isoforms, the<lb/> most common ones being Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42), which<lb/> differ from the former by two extra amino acids at the C-<lb/>terminus, making it more hydrophobic. These co-existing<lb/> isoforms aggregate differently when separate <ref type="biblio">[12, 13]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, in vivo these isoforms coexist, which is not<lb/> clear how they influence each other. In fact, it was found<lb/> that the amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients<lb/> were mainly, and sometimes exclusively, constituted of<lb/> Aβ(1-42) <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>, despite that Aβ(1-40) concentration is<lb/> several-fold higher than Aβ(1-42) one. The co-aggregation<lb/> of these two isoforms was intensively studied over the last<lb/> decade <ref type="biblio">[15, 16]</ref>. Some authors claimed that the peptide<lb/> mixing only influences the elongation phase by seeding<lb/> the fibrillation, but no heteromolecular fibrils are formed<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. But other reports suggested that mixed fibrils could<lb/> be formed <ref type="biblio">[15, 17]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In previous works, we showed the potential of Tay-<lb/>lor dispersion analysis (TDA) to speciate the aggregation<lb/> process of Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42), as pure or mixed pep-<lb/>tide solutions <ref type="biblio">[13, 18]</ref>. In this work, we present the use<lb/> of TDA coupled with simultaneous UV and light-emitting<lb/> diode-induced fluorescence (LEDIF) detections to study<lb/> the influence of the fluorescent tag FITC on the Aβ pep-<lb/>tide aggregation and to unravel if heteromolecular species<lb/> are formed along the aggregation course.<lb/></p>

			<head>2<lb/> MATERIALS AND METHODS<lb/></head>

			<head>2.1<lb/> Materials<lb/></head>

			<p>Aβ(1-40) was prepared by fast conventional SPPS using<lb/> an Fmoc orthogonal strategy, as described elsewhere <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>.<lb/> Aβ(1-42) (batch number 100002591, &gt;95% purity by HPLC)<lb/> was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland).<lb/> Both FITC peptides were tagged on their N-terminal side,<lb/> and the molar mass of the tagged peptides was confirmed<lb/> by MALDI-MS (provider) and HPLC-ESI-MS in this<lb/> work (4790 and 5016 g/mol for tagged Aβ (tAβ)(1-40) and<lb/> tAβ(1-42), respectively). Sodium dihydrogen phosphate<lb/> and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Sigma Aldrich<lb/> (France). All buffers were prepared using ultrapure water<lb/> obtained from a MilliQ system (Millipore, France).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2<lb/> Peptide pretreatment and sample<lb/> preparation<lb/></head>

			<p>Both native Aβ (nAβ) and tagged Aβ (tAβ) peptides were<lb/> pretreated independently using the protocol previously<lb/> described <ref type="biblio">[13, 19]</ref>. Briefly, the peptides were first dissolved<lb/> at a concentration of 2 g/L in an ammonium hydroxide<lb/> solution (NH 4 OH), which differed between the two stud-<lb/>ied peptides (0.10% (m/v) for Aβ(1-40), 0.16% (m/v) for<lb/> Aβ(1-42)). The peptide solutions were then incubated for<lb/> 10 min at room temperature then aliquoted and freeze-<lb/>dried. The stock aliquots contained 10 nmol of peptide,<lb/></p>

			<p>and lyophilized peptide aliquots were stored at -20 • C until<lb/> use. The pure tagged or native peptide solutions were pre-<lb/>pared directly from the aliquoted fractions and dissolved<lb/> in the adequate amount of buffer to reach the desired final<lb/> peptide concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 µM.<lb/></p>

			<p>The mixed aliquots containing both nAβ and tAβ were<lb/> prepared so that the final sample contained either 7% of<lb/> tAβ(1-40) or 10% of tAβ(1-42). First stock aliquot of native<lb/> or tagged peptides was dissolved in 100 µl of 0.16% (m/v)<lb/> NH 4 OH, then appropriate volumes were used to obtain the<lb/> desired combinations having a total Aβ content of 10 nmol,<lb/> as detailed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Figures <ref type="figure">1, 2</ref> and 3 show pie charts<lb/> with the proportion of the native and tagged peptides in the<lb/> samples. The final aliquots were immediately subjected to<lb/> freeze-drying and then stored at -20 • C before being dis-<lb/>solved in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 to perform the<lb/> aggregation study.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3<lb/> Study of Aβ aggregation by Taylor<lb/> dispersion analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>TDA was performed using an Agilent 7100 (Waldbronn,<lb/> Germany) capillary electrophoresis system with bare fused<lb/> silica capillary (Polymicro Technologies, USA), having<lb/> 60 cm × 50 µm i.d. dimensions and a UV detection window<lb/> at 51.5 cm from the inlet end. The system was coupled with<lb/> a Zetalif LEDIF detector (Picometrics, Toulouse, France)<lb/> with a window at 33 cm from the inlet end. The capillary<lb/> was conditioned with the following flushes: 1 M NaOH<lb/> (30 min) followed by a flush with ultrapure water (30 min).<lb/> Between each analysis, the capillary was rinsed with a<lb/> 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 for 2 min. Sam-<lb/>ples were injected hydrodynamically on the inlet end of<lb/> the capillary (44 mbar, 4 s), and the injected volume was<lb/> about 6.5 nl, corresponding to 1% of the capillary volume<lb/> to the LEDIF detection point and 0.64% with respect to the<lb/> UV detection window. In the case of the 1, 10 and 100 µM<lb/> tAβ(1-42) samples, the solutions were injected hydrody-<lb/>namically by applying for 3 s a pressure of 33, 55 and<lb/> 6 mbar, respectively. The injection volumes were modified<lb/> to prevent detector saturation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Experiments were performed at a mobilization pressure<lb/> of 100 mbar. The temperature of the capillary cartridge was<lb/> set at 37 • C and the vial carrousel was thermostated using<lb/> an external circulating water bath 600F from JULABO<lb/> (Germany). The solutes were simultaneously monitored by<lb/> UV with an absorbance measured at 191 nm and by flu-<lb/>orescence with an excitation at 480 nm. Emission light<lb/> was collected through a ball lens and a high-pass filter<lb/> in the wavelength range from 515 to 760 nm. The propor-<lb/>tion of tagged peptide in the mixtures was chosen so that<lb/> the obtained LEDIF signal was as high as possible without<lb/> saturating the detector. The higher fluorescence intensity<lb/> observed for tAβ(1-40) presumably stems from the pres-<lb/>ence of unreacted FITC during synthesis, as observed for<lb/> these samples from the taylorgrams (see Figures <ref type="figure">S1-S8</ref>).<lb/> The mobile phase was a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer<lb/> (pH 7.4; viscosity at 37 • C: 0.7 × 10 -4 Pa s). Peptide aliquots<lb/> were first dissolved in 100 µl of a 20 mM sodium phosphate<lb/> buffer solution (pH 7.4) to reach a final concentration<lb/> of 100 µM and then immediately transferred to a vial to<lb/> be incubated at 37 • C in the capillary electrophoresis car-<lb/>rousel. The aggregation was conducted by injecting the<lb/> sample (V inj ≈ 7 nl) every 11 min for 100% Aβ(1-42) experi-<lb/>ments, and each 30 min for all the experiments containing<lb/> Aβ(1-40). The total average of TDA injections was between<lb/> 124 and 185 TDA runs per sample, corresponding to a total<lb/> sample volume consumption between 870 and 1300 nl (0.87<lb/> and 1.3 µl). Finally, to prevent sample evaporation, the vial<lb/> cap was changed three times a day. All taylorgrams were<lb/> recorded using Agilent ChemStation software and then<lb/> exported to Microsoft Excel for subsequent data process-<lb/>ing. The data obtained from the UV signal were treated on<lb/> the right side of the taylorgram to avoid the spikes detected<lb/> on the left part, as described elsewhere <ref type="biblio">[13, 18]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3<lb/> RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<head>3.1<lb/> Influence of the peptide<lb/> concentration<lb/></head>

			<p>The effect of the peptide concentration on the kinetics of<lb/> the aggregation process was first investigated by TDA at<lb/> different tagged peptide (tAβ(1-42)) concentrations rang-<lb/>ing from 1 to 100 µM. As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>, the<lb/> total peak area, obtained by integrating the taylorgrams<lb/> from the LEDIF detection, did not evolve significantly in<lb/></p>

			<figure>F I G U R E 1 Peak area evolution of the monomer and small oligomer populations obtained for both nAβ + tAβ systems and 100% nAβ<lb/> experiments at 100 µM total peptide concentration (except for 3:1 native peptides mixture where the concentration was of 133 µM) as obtained<lb/> from the analysis of the UV-TDA (Taylor dispersion analysis) elution profile: (A) 100% nAβ(1-40), (B) 75% nAβ(1-40) + 25% nAβ(1-42), (C)<lb/> 100% nAβ(1-42), (D) 93% nAβ(1-40) + 7% tAβ(1-40), (E) 68% nAβ(1-40) + 7% nAβ(1-40) + 25% nAβ(1-42), (F) 75% nAβ(1-40) + 15%<lb/> nAβ(1-42) + 10% tAβ(1-42) and (G) 90% nAβ(1-42) + 10% tAβ(1-42). Peak area was normalized to obtain a better comparison of the species<lb/> evolution, by dividing the area of each data point to the total peak area obtained for the first run at t ag = 0 h. The pie charts in inset denote the<lb/> proportion of the nAβ and tAβ content in the studied samples.<lb/></figure>

			<p>the case of the lowest concentrations (1 and 10 µM), over<lb/> the wholly studied incubation time (352 h for the 1 µM sam-<lb/>ple and 162 h for the 10 µM sample), suggesting that the<lb/> kinetics of the aggregation at these concentrations is very<lb/> slow, as shown in the literature the kinetics of the aggre-<lb/>gation increase with increasing concentration <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. The<lb/> normalization of the peak area in Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref> was realized<lb/> for the sake of comparison and was obtained by dividing<lb/> each peak area of each run by the peak area obtained at<lb/> t ag = 0 h.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case of the highest concentration (i.e., 100 µM),<lb/> the peak area decreased to reach a plateau after ∼3 h of<lb/> incubation. The comparison, with a sample having the<lb/> same 100 µM total peptide concentration but with a mixing<lb/> of 90 µM nAβ(1-42) with 10 µM of tAβ(1-42), demonstrated<lb/> similar kinetics of aggregation from the LEDIF peak area.<lb/> In addition, Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref> shows the average R h obtained<lb/> for the 100 µM samples by the integration of the LEDIF<lb/> elution profiles as described elsewhere <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. At t ag = 0 h<lb/> and during the first hour of incubation, the average R h<lb/> was around 1.9 nm (corresponding to the size of the Aβ(1-<lb/>42) monomer and small oligomer population, in good<lb/> agreement with previously published works <ref type="biblio">[13, 18]</ref>). After<lb/> about 1 h, the R h value decreased to reach a plateau around<lb/> 0.8 nm, which most likely corresponds to the free fluores-<lb/>cent tag or free tagged amino acids (FITC, theoretical R h<lb/> obtained from modelization <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref> using HydroPro software<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref> on an energy-minimized 3D structure is 0.64 nm).<lb/> In the case of the low concentration samples, the R h at<lb/> t ag = 0 h was of 1.95 and 1.85 nm for the 1 and the 10 µM<lb/> samples, respectively. The average R h value decreased<lb/> very slowly with the appearance of the small population<lb/> (R h ∼ 0.8 nm) and reached the plateau after 2 weeks for the<lb/> 1 µM sample (see Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). Even though it is theoretically<lb/> possible to follow the aggregation process at these two low<lb/> concentrations and for a relatively long period of time, it is<lb/> not possible to do a control run without the fluorescent tag<lb/> at these concentrations because of the low sensitivity of<lb/> the UV detection as compared to fluorescence. Therefore,<lb/> in order to study the impact of the fluorescent tag, it seems<lb/></p>

The species are represented as follows: monomer and low molar mass<lb/> oligomers (squares, ■), higher molar mass oligomers (circles, •) and protofibrils (triangles, ▲). Experimental conditions: Sample: 100 µM<lb/> total Aβ; 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Incubation: quiescent conditions at 37 • C. Fused silica capillaries: 50 µm i.d. × 60 cm × 51.5 cm.<lb/> Mobile phase: 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Mobilization pressure: 100 mbar. Injection: 44 mbar for 4 s, V i ≈ 7 nl (V i /V d ≈ 0.6%). Analyses<lb/> were performed at 37 • C. UV detection at 191 nm<lb/> </figure>
				
			<p>important to apply conditions, in which both native and<lb/> tagged peptides could be followed simultaneously.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion of this first part, it was found that a high<lb/> concentration of typically 100 µM was recommended to<lb/> study the impact of the fluorescent tag on the aggrega-<lb/>tion process within a reasonable time range (few days<lb/> instead of weeks). Therefore, if fluorescent detection<lb/> combined with a low peptide concentration (below 1 µM)<lb/> seems hardly applicable for monitoring amyloid peptide<lb/> aggregation because of slow kinetics, the impact of the<lb/> fluorescent tag on the aggregation process may however be<lb/> studied on mixed mixtures of native and tagged peptides,<lb/> at 100 µM total peptide concentration. To increase the<lb/> aggregation kinetics for low concentration samples, the<lb/> use of preformed seeds might also be a suitable option.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2<lb/> Monitoring the aggregation process<lb/> of Aβ peptides by TDA-UV<lb/></head>

			<p>In this work, we used a proportion of tagged peptide<lb/> between 7% and 10% (see pie charts in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), keeping<lb/> constant the total peptide concentration at ∼100 µM.<lb/> Simultaneous UV and fluorescent detections could be<lb/> compared using these mixed non-tagged and tagged mix-<lb/>tures. The UV detection was used to determine the kinetics<lb/></p>

			<p>of aggregation which can be compared in the presence or<lb/> in the absence of tagged peptide. In a recent work <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>, we<lb/> showed by TDA that the products of Aβ peptide aggrega-<lb/>tion could be divided into four main populations differing<lb/> by their size. The first population is that of monomeric<lb/> and small oligomeric forms of the peptides having an<lb/> R h &lt; 5 nm. The second population corresponds to higher<lb/> molar mass oligomers with R h between 4 and 50 nm. The<lb/> third population shows R h &gt; 50 nm and corresponds to<lb/> soluble protofibrillar structures. Finally the fourth one is<lb/> that of insoluble fibrils which size is not accessible by TDA.<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> displays one example of taylorgram deconvolution<lb/> with the contributions of the different populations to the<lb/> total UV signal. The residual trace shown in the upper part<lb/> of Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> (difference between the experimental data and<lb/> the theoretical fit) represents the soluble fibril fraction.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> are presented the area of the monomer and<lb/> small oligomers population obtained by deconvolution<lb/> of the elution profile by UV detection over the whole<lb/> aggregation process for all the studied systems. The evo-<lb/>lution of this population was found to be representative<lb/> of the aggregation kinetics <ref type="biblio">[13, 18]</ref> via the consumption<lb/> of the monomeric units. As can be seen from Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>,<lb/> nAβ(1-40) showed a lag phase of about 18 h before a rapid<lb/> decrease in the monomeric population to reach a final<lb/> lower plateau after ∼26 h. Aβ(1-40) is thought to follow a<lb/> secondary nucleation mechanism, where monomers add<lb/> to already existing fibrils to produce larger fibrils, without<lb/> going through intermediate states as discussed in the lit-<lb/>erature <ref type="biblio">[20, 23, 24]</ref>. Conversely, the nAβ(1-42) (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>)<lb/> decreased rapidly (less than 1 h) without showing any<lb/> lag phase. The 3:1 nAβ(1-40):nAβ(1-42) mixture showed<lb/> a similar trend as for the nAβ(1-42) sample but with<lb/> slower kinetics (the plateau was reached after 16 h). As<lb/> displayed in Figure <ref type="figure">1D</ref>, the addition of 7% of tAβ(1-40) to<lb/> nAβ(1-40) did not seem to affect the lag phase; however,<lb/> it affected the kinetics of the monomer consumption<lb/> which reached a plateau after ∼60 h instead of 26 h for<lb/> the 100% native sample. This observation suggests that<lb/> the tagged peptide influenced the elongation phase of<lb/> the aggregation mechanism but not the nucleation step.<lb/> When the tAβ(1-42) (10%) was added to the nAβ(1-42)<lb/> sample (see Figure <ref type="figure">1G</ref>), the kinetics of the aggregation<lb/> decreased as well and the time to reach the final lower<lb/> plateau changed from less than 1 h to about 3 h. Similarly,<lb/> in the case of the 3:1 mixture of Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42), when<lb/> 7% of tAβ(1-40) peptides were added to the sample,<lb/> the aggregation pathway was not significantly changed<lb/> compared to the native mixture. However, slower kinetics<lb/> were observed (lower plateau reached after 36 h instead<lb/> of 16 h for the native mixture; see Figure <ref type="figure">1E<lb/></ref> compared to Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). These results suggest that the nAβ(1-42)<lb/> peptide is driving the aggregation process: It rapidly<lb/> formed the nucleus (no lag phase) and the elongation step<lb/> was slowed by the tAβ(1-40). Likewise, when a fraction<lb/> of tAβ(1-42) was added to the mixture, the aggregation<lb/> mechanism resembled to the aggregation mechanism of<lb/> Aβ(1-40) solutions, that is, a lag phase was observed up to<lb/> about 30 h and then the monomer population proportion<lb/> decreased until it reached a final plateau at about 60 h.<lb/> These observations confirmed that the tAβ(1-42) delayed<lb/> the formation of the Aβ(1-42) nucleus serving as a seed<lb/> for the elongation of Aβ(1-40). In a study by Zheng et al.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>, the effect of several fluorescent tags, among which<lb/> FITC tag used in this work, on the aggregation process<lb/> of tAβ(1-42) was investigated using FCS. The authors<lb/> concluded that the FITC tag decreased the propensity of<lb/> oligomers to aggregate and they attributed this effect to the<lb/> increase of the peptide hydrophilicity by the fluorescent<lb/> tag. Further, it was reported that the nAß(1-42) monomer<lb/> and its fibrillary structures adopt compacted confor-<lb/>mations <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>, in which the N-terminus is supposedly<lb/> water-shielded. In this work, the FITC tag can change<lb/> the hydrophilic-hydrophobic balance of the peptides, can<lb/> induce steric hindrance or may change the peptide con-<lb/>formation, leading to a lower propensity for aggregation.<lb/> For instance, it was reported in the literature that the<lb/> N-terminally truncated amyloid peptides were more prone<lb/> to aggregation than the full length ones <ref type="biblio">[26-29]</ref> because<lb/> the truncated peptides would become more hydrophobic,<lb/> which supports that an increase in hydrophilicity at the<lb/> N-terminus region would impair the aggregation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the hydrodynamic radii obtained for all<lb/> studied samples and for all populations obtained by decon-<lb/>volution of the UV elution profile. The monomers and low<lb/> molar mass oligomers have an R h of 1.60-2.25 nm which<lb/> was relatively constant during the whole aggregation pro-<lb/>cess (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, monomers). According to our previous<lb/> study, these values suggest that this population mainly<lb/> comprises monomers and dimers <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. As for the higher<lb/> mass oligomer population, it varied from ∼4 to ∼30 nm for<lb/> all studied samples with an average value around 10 nm.<lb/> Then the R h of protofibrils ranged from 50 to 250 nm for all<lb/> studied systems. These results suggest that the fluorescent<lb/> tag did not influence the size of the different populations<lb/> when compared to native samples.<lb/></p>

			<p>When a deeper look is taken at the higher mass oligomer<lb/> population for the 3:1 mixtures with and without tagged<lb/> peptides (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>), the following observations could be<lb/> made: first, in the native peptides mixture, this population<lb/> increased in proportion and reached a maximum value<lb/> after 6 h incubation and then decreased and reached a<lb/> lower plateau after 15 h. Then, the addition of tAβ(1-40)<lb/> did not seem to significantly influence the evolution of<lb/> this population, which seemed to disappear after 24 h in<lb/> both cases (with and without tAβ(1-40)). Finally, when<lb/> tAβ(1-42) was added to the mixture, the bell-shaped dis-<lb/>tribution extended from 0 h up till 60 h with a maximum<lb/> reached around 30 h, suggesting that the oligomers are<lb/> more stabilized under these conditions.<lb/></p>

			<figure>F I G U R E 6 Peak area evolution of the higher molar mass<lb/> oligomer population obtained from the UV analysis of the Taylor<lb/> dispersion analysis (TDA) elution profile for 3:1<lb/> Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) -75% nAβ(1-40) + 25% nAβ(1-42) (squares); 3:1<lb/> Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) -68% nAβ(1-40) + 7% nAβ(1-40) + 25%<lb/> nAβ(1-42) (circles); and 3:1 Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) -75%<lb/> nAβ(1-40) + 15% nAβ(1-42) + 10% tAβ(1-42) (triangles). Peak area<lb/> was normalized, to obtain a better comparison of the species<lb/> evolution, by dividing the area of each data point to the total peak<lb/> area obtained for the first run at t ag = 0 h.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The comparison of the evolution of the monomer and<lb/> small oligomer populations, obtained from the elution pro-<lb/>files from the UV and the LEDIF detections (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>),<lb/> showed no difference in the pathway between the tagged<lb/> peptide (selectively detected by LEDIF) and the total pep-<lb/>tides (detected by UV; composed of tagged and non-tagged<lb/> peptides), suggesting that the aggregation involves all the<lb/> different peptides at all steps and that the formed assem-<lb/>blies might be heteromolecular (mixture of Aβ(1-40) and<lb/> Aβ(1-42)). Figure <ref type="figure">3C</ref> helps supporting this claim as a rapid<lb/> decrease of tAβ(1-42) is observed during the first hours of<lb/> incubation, probably corresponding to the formation of a<lb/> nucleus, followed by a plateau. Then, another decrease in<lb/> the tAβ(1-42) fraction is observed after about 24 h suggest-<lb/>ing the onset of the elongation phase with the participation<lb/> of the Aβ(1-40) (predominantly present in the sample)<lb/> where the decrease of the monomer population in UV is<lb/> observed as well.<lb/></p>

			<head>4<lb/> CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>In this work, we showed the ability of TDA to follow<lb/> the aggregation process of labelled Aβ peptides by flu-<lb/>orescence detection and to study the effect of the label<lb/> on the aggregation propensity of amyloid peptides. It was<lb/> found that at very low concentrations (lower than 10 µM),<lb/> the aggregation kinetics were drastically decreased and<lb/> the monitoring of the aggregation at these concentrations<lb/> would be a long process (days or weeks). To increase<lb/> the kinetics and the experimental throughput, the con-<lb/>centration was increased up to 100 µM with a certain<lb/> proportion of fluorescent-tagged peptides. At this concen-<lb/>tration, it was possible to monitor the aggregation process<lb/> of Aβ peptide mixtures in a reasonable amount of time.<lb/> Further, it was reported that the aggregation of Aβ(1-40)<lb/> and Aβ(1-42) was affected by a small proportion of FITC<lb/> label. The effect of the fluorescent tag was observed on<lb/> the elongation phase rather than on the nucleation one.<lb/> Further, in the case of Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) mixtures, when<lb/> the tagged peptide was Aβ(1-42), it was observed a higher<lb/> influence of the FITC label on the aggregation mechanism<lb/> than with the tAβ(1-40). As a consequence, the formed<lb/> oligomers in Aβ(1-40):Aβ(1-42) mixtures (with a defined<lb/> proportion of tAβ(1-42)) had a substantial increase of their<lb/> lifetime and potentially of their toxicity. Finally, the com-<lb/>parison of both detection modes allowed to assume that<lb/> the aggregation mechanism was a heteromolecular pro-<lb/>cess involving both peptide isoforms and both tagged and<lb/> untagged peptides in the aggregates. In perspective, the<lb/> study of seeding at low Aβ concentrations and the effect of<lb/> the truncation on the aggregation process, monitored and<lb/> speciated by TDA would be an important input into the<lb/> huge amount of literature dealing with the aggregation of<lb/> amyloid peptides.</p>
