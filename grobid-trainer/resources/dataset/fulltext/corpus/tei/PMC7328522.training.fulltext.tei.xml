			<p>Thiol groups play key roles in a diverse range of biological processes ranging from acting as<lb/> active site nucleophiles in enzymatic reactions to participating in disulfide bonds to stabilize<lb/> protein structure as well as serving as sites for post-translational modifications. <ref type="biblio">1-3</ref> The<lb/> ability to mask a thiol group with a protecting group allows the resulting &quot;caged&quot;<lb/> biomolecule to be maintained in an inactive state prior to &quot;uncaging&quot; it by deprotection.<lb/> Photoremovable caging groups <ref type="biblio">4</ref> are useful for biological applications since the uncaging<lb/> process can be initiated by illumination with light without the necessity of adding additional<lb/> reagents such as acids or bases that can perturb biological activity. <ref type="biblio">5,6</ref> Light activated<lb/> processes are particularly well suited for applications in live cells where it is generally not<lb/> possible to use reagent-based deprotection conditions due to cellular toxicity. <ref type="biblio">7<lb/></ref> Photoremovable protecting groups are also advantageous due to the unique features<lb/> associated with light activation since uncaging can be triggered with high spatiotemporal<lb/> control; the specific location and time of deprotection can be controlled by the position and<lb/> timing of illumination. The spatial precision of uncaging can be improved using two-photon<lb/> (TP) activation provided the protecting group chromophore manifests a usable TP action<lb/> cross section; the development of caged neurotransmitters has benefited substantially from<lb/> this feature. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> TP activation also reduces potential phototoxicity since irradiation is<lb/> performed at double the wavelength employed for UV excitation, which is in the visible or<lb/> near IR region of the electromagnetic spectrum.<lb/></p>

			<p>In solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), a vast number of protecting groups have been<lb/> developed for cysteine. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> However, for light-mediated deprotection, the most common<lb/> protecting group used for thiol protection is the o-nitrobenzyl group (NB) <ref type="biblio">10</ref> and related<lb/> analogues including o-nitroveratryl (NV) (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). <ref type="biblio">7,11-14</ref> While robust and useful for<lb/> many applications, such protecting groups do not exhibit useful TP action cross-sections,<lb/> thus limiting their utility. To circumvent this limitation, several groups have investigated the<lb/> use of other protecting groups based on coumarin, quinoline and dibenzofuran scaffolds.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">15-18</ref> Thiol protecting groups based on a coumarin core have been studied and employed for<lb/> a range of applications. <ref type="biblio">18-21</ref> Protecting groups employing a thioether bond such as Bhc are<lb/> more stable than those featuring a thiocarbonate linkage (BCMACMOC). However,<lb/> irradiation of the former is often accompanied by isomerization without photocleavage <ref type="biblio">18,20<lb/></ref> while the latter can undergo rearrangement when unprotected thiols or primary amine groups<lb/> are present within the same peptide. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> In earlier work, we explored the use of the<lb/> nitrodibenzofuran (NDBF) group for thiol protection and found it to exhibit a faster rate<lb/> towards UV photolysis relative to simple NV-based protecting groups. <ref type="biblio">18</ref> Moreover, it<lb/> manifested a useful TP cross-section that could be particularly applicable to biological<lb/> experiments performed in live cells. Previous work with the NV group suggests that its<lb/> photochemical properties can be modulated via substitution of the aryl ring. <ref type="biblio">22</ref> Here we<lb/> describe the synthesis of a new NDBF-based protecting group bearing a methoxy substituent<lb/> and use it to prepare Fmoc-Cys(MeO-NDBF)-OH (1), a building block suitable for SPPS. In<lb/> the design of this moiety, we elected to preserve the ethyl group used in 2 as the point of<lb/> thiol linkage (resulting in an additional stereogenic center) since photolysis of such<lb/> compounds leads to the production of ketone products that have less putative cellular<lb/> toxicity compared with the aldehyde products that are formed from simpler groups such as<lb/> NV. <ref type="biblio">23</ref> This reagent was then used to assemble two biologically relevant peptides and<lb/> characterize their photolysis kinetics in both UV-and TP-mediated reactions. Finally,<lb/> uncaging of these protected peptides by either UV or TP activation was used to initiate their<lb/> subsequent enzymatic processing by the enzyme farnesyltransferase. These experiments<lb/> highlight the utility of this new protecting group for SPPS and biological experiments.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<head>Synthetic Chemistry.<lb/></head>

			<p>In our earlier work, N-Fmoc-L-Cys(NDBF)-OH (2) was prepared starting from<lb/> dibenzofuran. For the preparation of N-Fmoc-L-Cys(MeO-NDBF-OH) (1), a new, and more<lb/> general route (Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>), was developed to facilitate the synthesis of substituted<lb/> dibenzofurans. The precursor, 2-bromo-5-methoxyphenol, containing the desired methoxy<lb/> group was treated with 4-fluoro-2-nitrobenzaldehyde to yield diarylether 3. Protection of the<lb/> aldehyde as an acetal followed by palladium-catalyzed aryl coupling and deprotection<lb/> afforded aldehyde 6 that was then converted to the racemic secondary alcohol, 7, using<lb/> trimethylaluminum. That alcohol was then activated to the corresponding bromide that was<lb/> then used to alkylate N-Fmoc-L-cysteine methyl ester under acidic conditions <ref type="biblio">24</ref> to produce<lb/> the fully protected amino acid 9. Hydrolysis of that ester using trimethyltin hydroxide <ref type="biblio">25</ref> gave<lb/> N-Fmoc-L-Cys(MeO-NDBF)-OH (1), a protected form of cysteine suitable for solid phase<lb/> peptide synthesis; mild conditions are essential for the hydrolysis of 9 to avoid potential<lb/> racemization of the protected cysteine residue.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the desired building block in hand, a series of peptides (10-18, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) based on two<lb/> different sequences incorporating the caged cysteine residue were prepared. First, a 15-<lb/>residue peptide based on the sequence of a-factor, a yeast pheromone, was prepared starting<lb/> with Fmoc-Ala on Wang resin. Fmoc-deprotection and two cycles of standard SPPS using an<lb/> automated synthesizer yielded a VIA tripeptide on resin. Next, N-Fmoc-L-Cys(MeO-<lb/>NDBF)-OH (1) was coupled offline with ninhydrin monitoring to insure complete reaction;<lb/> to increase the coupling efficiency, the coupling time was extended to 4 hours for this<lb/> modified cysteine residue. At that point, automated peptide synthesis was resumed to<lb/> complete the synthesis. After final Fmoc-deprotection, the peptide was cleaved from the<lb/> resin under acidic conditions, precipitated with ether, and the resulting crude material<lb/> purified via reversed-phase HPLC to yield the desired peptide. The final peptide, 10, was<lb/> analyzed via LC-MS/MS to confirm the sequence (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). a-Factor-based peptides 11<lb/> and 12 containing NDBF-and NV-protected cysteine were also prepared and characterized<lb/> in a similar manner (see Tables <ref type="table">S2 and S3</ref>). A second peptide sequence based on the C-<lb/>terminus of the human K-Ras protein was also synthesized. Forms of that peptide containing<lb/> either Cys(MeO-NDBF) (15) or Cys(NDBF) (16) were prepared. Following purification of<lb/> the complete peptides, their sequences were again confirmed via LC-MS/MS analysis<lb/> (Tables <ref type="table">S4 and S5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the initial preparation and purification of 10, the HPLC chromatogram of the crude<lb/> peptide revealed the presence of two double peaks: a main double peak corresponding to<lb/> ~70-80% of the total integrated area, and a minor double peak corresponding to ~20-30% of<lb/> the total integrated area. The double peak pattern was clearer for the NDBF-protected<lb/> peptides 11 and 16 (Figures <ref type="figure">S1 and S2</ref>). For each peptide, all four peaks exhibited identical<lb/> m/z values and MS/MS fragmentation patterns. We attribute the two species present in each<lb/> of the double peaks as resulting from a mixture of two epimers due to the stereogenic center<lb/> adjacent to the dibenzofuran since bromide 8 was used as a racemic mixture. We attribute<lb/> the major double peak to be from the desired L-cysteine-containing peptides and the minor<lb/> double peak to be from D-cysteine-containing peptides that arise due to racemization of the<lb/> protected cysteine either during the hydrolysis of ester 9 or in the subsequent activation of 1<lb/> during SPPS. This structural assignment is supported by the fact that peak doubling was not<lb/> observed with peptide 12 (Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>) which does not have the additional stereogenic center<lb/> present in 10 and 11 (since the NV group lacks the methyl group present in the NDBF and<lb/> MeO-NDBF protecting groups); however, 12 did have one major and one minor peak of<lb/> identical mass, presumably due to racemization of the cysteine as noted above. This<lb/> hypothesis was further corroborated when photolysis of the combined double peaks (from<lb/> 11) led to the generation of two product peaks (13) exhibiting the same m/z ratio, whereas<lb/> photolysis of the purified major double peak lead to the generation of a single product peak<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref>). While it was possible to remove the minor components via HPLC separation<lb/> and use the resulting material for subsequent experiments, this may not always be possible<lb/> depending on the specific peptide sequence under study. Hence, the epimerization process<lb/> was studied in more detail to obtain a more optimized synthetic procedure.<lb/></p>

			<p>To better understand the origin of the epimerization observed here, we first elected to study<lb/> the hydrolysis of a Mosher&apos;s amide of NDBF-protected cysteine methyl ester (23a) to the<lb/> corresponding acid (24a). Accordingly, that compound was prepared from 21a by removal<lb/> of the Fmoc group followed by acylation with (S)-Mosher&apos;s acid chloride [(S)-(+)-α-<lb/>methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride] to yield the desired cysteine methyl<lb/> ester derivative (23a). Inspection of the 19 F NMR revealed the presence of two signals at<lb/> -69.03 and -68.92 ppm, consistent with the presence of two diastereomers (with equal<lb/> integration) due to the epimeric mixture, resulting from the stereogenic center present in the<lb/> NDBF group. Hydrolysis of the ester to the corresponding acid (24a) under conditions<lb/> necessary to obtain complete conversion (Me 3 SnOH, DCE, 75°, 12 h) and subsequent 19 F<lb/> NMR analysis showed only two signals (at -69.02 and -68.92 ppm, Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>) suggesting<lb/> that no epimerization had occurred in the hydrolysis reaction; even when ester 23a was<lb/> subjected to more forcing conditions (Me 3 SnOH, DCE, 85°, overnight), no additional peaks<lb/> in the 19 F NMR were observed. To confirm the absence of epimerization, the authentic<lb/> product (the diastereomeric ester containing D-cysteine) was independently prepared by<lb/> reacting bromide 19 with N-Fmoc-D-cysteine methyl ester followed by Fmoc removal and<lb/> acylation with (S)-Mosher&apos;s acid chloride to yield 23b. Analysis of that material via 19 F<lb/> NMR showed two signals at -68.86 and -68.82 ppm that are different than those present in<lb/> the material produced from L-cysteine demonstrating that the two cysteine derivatives<lb/> (prepared from the enantiomers of cysteine) can be clearly distinguished via 19 F NMR.<lb/> Hydrolysis of the D-cysteine analogue (23b) yielded the corresponding acid (24b) whose<lb/> 19 F NMR manifested two signals at -68.80 and 68.78 ppm (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>); an 19 F NMR of a<lb/> mixture of 24a and 24b confirms these chemical shift differences are real (Figure <ref type="figure">3C</ref>). This<lb/> result validates the use of 19 F NMR to monitor this epimerization process and suggests that<lb/> no significant level of epimerization occurs in the hydrolysis of 9 to 1.<lb/></p>

			<p>Next, we examined the potential for epimerization during SPPS. Karas et al. previously<lb/> reported that variable amounts of racemization occur in the activation of N-Fmoc-L-<lb/>Cys(NV)-OH depending on the precise coupling conditions used. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> We initially adjusted our<lb/> synthetic conditions and employed the optimal conditions described by them, consisting of<lb/> activation and coupling of 1 with 4 equivalents of N,N&apos;-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and<lb/> 6-chloro-1-hydroxybenzotriazole (Cl-HOBt) for 1 hour, for the synthesis of 10. However,<lb/> LC-MS/MS analysis of the resulting material after synthesis still showed significant<lb/> epimerization (Figure <ref type="figure">S5</ref>). To confirm that the epimerization was occurring in the activation/<lb/> coupling step of the protected cysteine residue, a model tripeptide GC(NDBF)F (18) was<lb/> prepared and subjected to prolonged treatment (2 h) with 20% piperidine/DMF to duplicate<lb/> the exposure to base that the embedded cysteine residue would experience (12 deprotection<lb/> steps) necessary to complete the synthesis of a-Factor. Comparison of chromatograms<lb/> obtained of the tripeptide before and after extensive piperidine treatment showed that no<lb/> additional epimerization had occurred (Figure <ref type="figure">S6</ref>), suggesting that cysteine racemization<lb/> must be occurring in the activation step. To minimize potential racemization, several<lb/> different coupling conditions for the caged cysteine residue were investigated by<lb/> synthesizing peptide 18 and subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis. Of the conditions surveyed,<lb/> the use of benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate<lb/> (PyBOP), 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) and DIEA gave the best results with less<lb/> than 2% racemization being observed. To confirm the utility of these revised conditions,<lb/> peptide 15 was resynthesized using 4 equivalents PyBOP/HOAT/DIEA for 30 min at a<lb/> concentration of 150 mM. After global deprotection and resin cleavage with Reagent K, LC-<lb/>MS analysis (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) showed less than 2% of the epimerized product was present. Overall,<lb/> these results indicate that NDBF-based protection of cysteine can be used to efficiently<lb/> prepare caged peptides. However, careful reaction monitoring is important to minimize<lb/> potential racemization during SPPS.<lb/></p>

			<head>Photochemistry.<lb/></head>

			<p>Previous work with o-nitrobenzyl-based protecting groups showed that the addition of<lb/> methoxy substituents to the nitrobenzyl chromophore shifted the absorbance maximum to<lb/> lower energy; that was accompanied by a decrease in the quantum yield for photolysis.<lb/> Comparison of the UV spectra of the parent compound, N-Fmoc-L-Cys(NDBF)-OH (2), and<lb/> N-Fmoc-L-Cys(MeO-NDBF)-OH (1), shown in Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>, indicates an increase in the<lb/> absorbance maximum from 320 to 355 nm, consistent with the aforementioned simple o-<lb/>nitrobenzyl-based system; in fact the absorbance maximum for 1 is quite similar to that of<lb/> the simpler nitroveratryl group present in N-Fmoc-L-Cys(NV)-OH. Inspection of the UV<lb/> spectra also shows that the extinction coefficients of the compounds at their λ max vary less<lb/> than 2-fold with the MeO-NDBF-protected residue exhibiting the highest value. At 350 nm,<lb/> the wavelength used for the UV irradiation experiments described below, the extinction<lb/> coefficient for the MeO-NDBF-protected residue is 1.9-fold higher than that for the NDBF-<lb/>protected parent compound (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Photolysis of peptides 10 and 11 using a Rayonet reactor centered at 350 nm and subsequent<lb/> LC-MS analysis showed that the two protecting groups uncage at comparable rates (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">S7</ref>). Since the bulbs used in these experiments manifest a fairly broad spectral bandwidth (~<lb/> 50 nm at half height), it is not possible to determine the quantum yields of these two<lb/> protecting groups from these experiments. However, it is clear from an operational<lb/> perspective (using a Rayonet reactor common to many laboratories performing photolysis<lb/> experiments) that these two protecting groups have similar UV photolysis properties. Those<lb/> results are in stark contrast to those obtained with peptide 12 that incorporates an NV-<lb/>protected cysteine where the rate of photolysis is 25-fold slower compared with peptide 10<lb/> (containing a MeO-NDBF-protected cysteine residue); using 14 bulbs in a Rayonet reactor,<lb/> peptides 10 and 11 are essentially completed deprotected in less than 30 seconds; for<lb/> comparison, at that point, ~90% of the NV-protected peptide remains unreacted (Figure <ref type="figure">S7</ref>).<lb/> Those results are similar to what we previously reported <ref type="biblio">18</ref> in comparing the monomeric<lb/> precursors Fmoc-Cys(NDBF)-OMe and Fmoc-Cys(NV)-OMe and highlight a key feature of<lb/> NDBF-based thiol protection, namely that it is much more sensitive to UV photolysis<lb/> compared with the simpler NV group.<lb/></p>

			<p>To quantify the photophysical properties of peptides 10 and 11 in more detail, photolysis<lb/> reactions were performed at low concentration to minimize any inner filter effect using an<lb/> apparatus (Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>) equipped with 350 nm LEDs with a narrower spectral bandwidth (~<lb/> 10 nm at half height, Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). After determining the intensity of the light source via<lb/> ferrioxylate actinometry, the apparatus was used to determine the rate of photolysis for<lb/> peptides 10, 11 and 12 (Figure <ref type="figure">6A</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S10</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>) and calculate their respective<lb/> quantum yields. Values of 0.53, 0.70 and 0.023 were obtained for 10, 11 and 12, respectively<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). It should be noted that the value obtained for peptide 11 that incorporates an<lb/> NDBF-protected thiol is comparable to the value reported for NDBF-EGTA (0.7), a caged<lb/> alcohol. These results quantitatively illustrate the greater efficiency of NDBF-based<lb/> protecting groups as photoremovable moieties compared with NV-based compounds and<lb/> serve to highlight their utility for uncaging applications.<lb/></p>

			<p>One of the most important features of the NDBF protecting group is that it manifests a<lb/> significant TP action cross-section for uncaging, making it useful for biological experiments.<lb/> Accordingly, we wanted to study the rates of photolysis of peptides 10 and 11 upon TP<lb/> activation. Thus, solutions of the peptides were irradiated at 800 nm using a Ti:Saphire laser<lb/> followed by LC-MS analysis. Interestingly, peptide 10 containing the MeO-NDBF-protected<lb/> cysteine residue uncaged at a rate 3.6-fold greater than peptide 11 containing the parent<lb/> NDBF-protected cysteine (Figure <ref type="figure">6B</ref>). Furthermore, irradiation of the K-Ras-derived, MeO-<lb/>NDBF-containing peptide 15 manifested an additional 2-fold rate increase compared to the<lb/> MeO-NDBF-containing a-Factor-derived peptide 10. Using BhcOAc as a standard, we<lb/> estimate the TP action cross-section for MeO-NDBF deprotection to be 0.7 GM for 10 and<lb/> 1.4 GM for 15. Presumably, the observed variation in the TP action cross-section of different<lb/> peptides incorporating the same chromophore reflects differences in the local structure/<lb/> environment around the chromophore; such results have been observed in homologues of<lb/> GFP where the fluorophore is constant throughout. <ref type="biblio">26</ref> Overall, these results constitute a<lb/> significant improvement in TP photolysis efficiency and suggests that the MeO-NDBF<lb/> protecting group could be particularly useful for TP activation of peptides containing caged<lb/> cysteines in cells or even tissue.<lb/></p>

			<head>Enzymatic reactions initiated by thiol uncaging.<lb/></head>

			<p>Caged peptide substrates have potentially significant utility in cell-based biological<lb/> experiments since they are unreactive prior to photolysis. Peptides can be incubated with<lb/> cells and allowed to accumulate before activation with light. As a prelude to such cell-based<lb/> experiments, we sought to investigate whether photolysis of peptides containing MeO-<lb/>NDBF protected cysteine residues could be used to liberate peptides that could serve as<lb/> substrates for enzymatic reactions. Protein farnesylation involves the transfer of the<lb/> isoprenyl group from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to proteins bearing C-terminal CaaX-box<lb/> sequences. <ref type="biblio">27</ref> Protein farnesyltransferase (PFTase) which catalyzes this reaction has been<lb/> intensely studied as a possible therapeutic target for a number of diseases including cancer.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">28,29</ref> Initially, peptide 10 was incubated in the presence of PFTase and the substrate FPP and<lb/> irradiated for 30 sec in a Rayonet photoreactor using three 350 nm bulbs. Analysis of the<lb/> resulting photolysis reaction via LC-MS before and after photolysis indicated that essentially<lb/> all of the starting peptide 10 (Figure <ref type="figure">S11A</ref>, before photolysis) had been converted to the<lb/> corresponding farnesylated product 14 (Figure <ref type="figure">S11C</ref>, after photolysis); in the absence of<lb/> PFTase, the deprotected thiol, 13, was the major species (Figure <ref type="figure">S11B</ref>, no PFTase).<lb/></p>

			<p>Next, we explored the TP-mediated process. Accordingly, peptide 10 was incubated in the<lb/> presence of PFTase and FPP and irradiated at 800 nm for 10 minutes using the laser system<lb/> described above. Analysis of the resulting photolysis reaction via LC-MS before and after<lb/> photolysis indicated substantial conversion of the starting peptide 10 (Figure <ref type="figure">7A</ref>, before<lb/> photolysis) to the corresponding farnesylated product 14 (Figure <ref type="figure">7C</ref>, after photolysis) with a<lb/> small amount of the free thiol (13) remaining. In contrast, in the absence of PFTase, the<lb/> major species present after irradiation was the free thiol (13) (Figure <ref type="figure">7B</ref>, after photolysis<lb/> without PFTase). To explore the dose dependence of this photochemical reaction, samples<lb/> containing 10, PFTase and FPP were irradiated at 800 nm for different times and the<lb/> amounts of starting peptide (10) and farnesylated product (14) were quantified from LC-MS<lb/> analysis. A plot of that data (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>) showed a clear relationship between light exposure<lb/> and product formation. Importantly, under these conditions, significant quantities of the<lb/> farnesylated product (~20%) were easily detected within the first five minutes of irradiation,<lb/> highlighting the efficiency of this process.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>In this work, the efficiency of TP-mediated thiol deprotection in cysteine-containing<lb/> peptides was improved using a new methoxy-substituted analogue of NDBF. An efficient<lb/> synthesis was developed to prepare Fmoc-Cys(MeO-NDBF)-OH (1), a protected form of<lb/> cysteine suitable for SPPS; installation of the methoxy substituent increased the absorption<lb/> maximum from 320 nm (NDBF) to 355 nm (MeO-NDBF). The cysteine analogue was<lb/> incorporated into two known bioactive peptides including a-Factor precursor (10, a<lb/> pentadecapeptide) and a fragment from the C-terminus of K-Ras (15, an undecapeptide). UV<lb/> irradiation of these MeO-NDBF-protected peptides resulted in deprotection at rates<lb/> comparable to those of peptides masked with the parent NDBF group but 25-fold faster<lb/> compared to an NV-protected peptide due to the larger quantum yield measured for the<lb/> NDBF-based caging groups. However, TP activation at 800 nm showed significant<lb/> differences between the two caging groups with the TP action cross-sections for 10 and 15<lb/> determined to be 0.71 and 1.4 GM, respectively using BhcOAc as a standard. These are 3.5-<lb/>and 7-fold higher for 10 and 15, respectively, compared to the previously reported value for<lb/> the parent NDBF group of 0.2 GM, also reproduced here using peptide 11. Finally,<lb/> deprotection of peptide 10 using either UV or 800 nm light rapidly liberated the free thiol<lb/> form (13) which was efficiently enzymatically transformed to its farnesylated congener (14)<lb/> via the action of PFTase. These experiments set the stage for future cell-based experiments<lb/> using this more efficiently removable protecting group. Finally, the results described here,<lb/> demonstrating an increase in TP action cross-section upon introduction of a methoxy<lb/> substituent, suggest additional exploration of the NDBF scaffold is warranted.<lb/></p>

			<head>General Procedure for Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).<lb/></head>

			<p>Peptides were synthesized using an automated solid-phase peptide synthesizer (PS3, Protein<lb/> Technologies Inc., Memphis, TN) employing Fmoc/HCTU-based chemistry. Fmoc-Met-<lb/>Wang or Fmoc-Ala-Wang resin (0.03 mmol) was placed in the reaction vessel and<lb/> deprotected twice using 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 5 min each time.<lb/> Four equivalents of amino acids and HCTU were activated in 0.4 M N-methylmorpholine<lb/> (NMM) for 1 min before adding to the resin. Standard incubation time for each coupling<lb/> was 20 min. Manual coupling of caged Fmoc-Cys derivatives was performed in a<lb/> polypropylene filter syringe equipped with a polypropylene stopcock. Four equivalents of<lb/> the protected cysteine were activated with 4 equivalents of HCTU in 1 mL 0.4 M NMM for<lb/> 10 min before adding to the resin. The reaction completion was tested every hour using a<lb/> ninhydrin assay. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> All caged Fmoc-Cys derivatives required 4 h for completion. Once the<lb/> ninhydrin assay confirmed the absence of any free amines, the resin was washed thoroughly<lb/> with DMF before placing back on the synthesizer and resuming the synthesis as previously<lb/> described. Once complete, approximately half of the resin was transferred to a syringe filter<lb/> and washed three times with CH 2 Cl 2 . Global deprotection and resin cleavage was<lb/> accomplished via treatment with 5 mL reagent K (82.5% TFA, 5% phenol, 5% water, 5%<lb/> thioanisole, and 2.5 % ethanedithiol) for 2 h. Cleaved peptides were precipitated with Et 2 O<lb/> and centrifuged before decanting the Et 2 O layer (repeated 3 times total). The resulting crude<lb/> peptide was dried via a stream of dry N 2 , then dissolved in 8 mL of a mixture of H 2 O/<lb/> CH 3 CN (1:1, v/v) containing 0.1% TFA, aided by sonication. The solution was filtered using<lb/> a 0.2 μm PTFE filter and then purified using preparative reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC. Once<lb/> pure peptides were obtained, their concentrations were quantified in solution using the ε 350<lb/> value measured for the caged Fmoc-Cys derivatives (1, 2 or Fmoc-Cys(NV)-OH). Stock<lb/> solutions were generated by dilution in H 2 O/CH 3 CN (1:1, v/v) containing 0.1% TFA to a<lb/> final concentration of 300 μM and stored at -20 °C.<lb/></p>

Aliquots (50 μL) were<lb/> withdrawn at various intervals ranging from 0 to 30 sec (up to 240 sec for peptide 12), and<lb/> 40 μL were subjected to LC-MS analysis. It is important to note that photolysis in H 2 O/<lb/> CH 3 CN (1:1, v/v) containing 0.1% TFA or in PB buffer containing 1 mM DTT led to<lb/> production of compounds with an m/z corresponding to the desired free thiols + 32 mass<lb/> units, believed to be the corresponding sulfinic acid (Figure <ref type="figure">S4A-B</ref>).

			<head>General Procedure for UV Photolysis of Caged Peptides in LED Reactor.<lb/></head>

			<p>Photolysis was conducted in a home-built LED reactor equipped with 8 × 350 nm LEDs<lb/> (FoxUV, 5.5mm) evenly spaced in a radial arrangement. A round quartz tube (10 × 50 mm)<lb/> with 1 mm wall thickness was positioned in the middle of the reactor. 200 μL of solution<lb/> was used for photolysis, resulting in an irradiated surface area of 1 cm 2 . Kinetic analyses<lb/> were performed using caged peptides diluted in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (PB), pH<lb/> 7.4 containing 15 mM DTT to a final concentration of 10 μM. At this concentration, &gt; 90%<lb/> transmittance occurs, thereby minimizing any inter-filter effect. The samples were irradiated<lb/> for varying amounts of time ranging from 0 to 90 sec (180 to 1080 for peptide 12), and then<lb/> 100 μL aliquots were subjected to LC-MS analysis with UV monitoring at 350 nm and MS<lb/> scanning over a 500-2000 m/z window. The gradient was isocratic at 1% buffer A for 5 min,<lb/> followed by a 1-100% gradient over 10 min (10% increase per min). Peaks exhibiting the<lb/> m/z of the caged peptide were integrated in the UV chromatogram, and the amount of<lb/> remaining caged peptide was calculated using the formula: Remaining SM (%) = (Peak area<lb/> after irradiation)/(Peak area of unirradiated sample)*100. The quantum yield of uncaging<lb/> (Φ) in mols/ein was calculated using the relationship Φ = (Iσt 90 ) -1 , where I is the irradiation<lb/> intensity in ein•cm -2 .sec -1 , σ is the decadic extinction coefficient in cm 2 •mol (1000•ε), and<lb/> t 90 is the irradiation time in seconds required to achieve 90% uncaging. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> The intensity (I) at<lb/> 350 nm was measured to be 1.93E-09 ein•cm -2 .sec -1 via actinometry using 6 mM potassium<lb/> ferrioxalate as a standard. <ref type="biblio">32<lb/></ref> Laser apparatus for Two-Photon (TP) irradiation:<lb/></p>
