			<p>Capturing and effectively using clinical information and knowl-<lb/>edge to ensure a quality, safe and sustainable healthcare service is<lb/> widely recognised as important <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref> and data from electronic health<lb/> records (EHRs) have been vital to decision-making on public health<lb/> policies during the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. An EHR provides a<lb/> longitudinal record of information regarding the health status of an<lb/> individual in computer-processible form across practices and spe-<lb/>cialists, and enables authorised access to clinical records in real-time<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[4,5]</ref>. As well as expanding the capacity to utilise clinical data for<lb/> monitoring of patient outcomes and conducting audits and research<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[6,7]</ref>, the EHR provides access to patient information in a timely<lb/> manner, enabling healthcare professionals (HCPs) to spend more time<lb/> with patients <ref type="biblio">8</ref> , reducing duplication of tests and work, and improving<lb/> the safety and quality of care provided <ref type="biblio">[4,7,9-14]</ref>. Additionally,<lb/> integration of other functions and software, such as clinical decision<lb/> support and bar code medication administration, further expand its<lb/> potential benefits <ref type="biblio">[15,16]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Electronic patient records (EPRs) or electronic medical records<lb/> (EMRs) also offer many of these benefits but solely contain the records<lb/> from an individual organization. Whilst shared or summary care records<lb/> and patient portals respectively store and facilitate access to specific<lb/> patient information required by HCPs <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref> and patients <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. Despite<lb/> the number of benefits which can be derived from these systems, chal-<lb/>lenges have been met in implementing a fully interoperable EHR be-<lb/>tween primary and secondary care <ref type="biblio">[13,19]</ref>, often attributed to the<lb/> implementation process as opposed to the product supplied by the EHR<lb/> vendor <ref type="biblio">[20,21]</ref>. Therefore, the implementation process is critical <ref type="biblio">[22]<lb/></ref> and must be considered as an ongoing process beginning during pro-<lb/>curement and continuing throughout each phase of design, develop-<lb/>ment, testing, &apos;Go Live&apos; and optimization.<lb/></p>

			<p>Whilst hospital information systems (HIS) in the USA have been in<lb/> existence since the 1960s <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>, HIS are a more recent phenomenon in<lb/> the Republic of Ireland where public healthcare is managed by the<lb/> Health Service Executive (HSE) which co-exists with a private health<lb/> system. The Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) has overall<lb/> responsibility for embedding technology within the health infra-<lb/>structure <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref> and to date, EPRs have been implemented in some<lb/> individual private and public hospitals and the majority of general<lb/> practitioner (GP) offices (i.e., private primary care physicians often<lb/> with HSE contracts), as well as for specific cohorts of patients (e.g.,<lb/> maternal and newborn, and epilepsy) <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>. However, many other<lb/> hospitals and HSE primary care (i.e., community) centres remain<lb/> largely paper-based. With an EHR in the pipeline <ref type="biblio">[24,26]</ref>, three na-<lb/>tional projects have been planned by eHealth Ireland which is led by<lb/> the Office of the CIO; Acute EHR, Community EHR and the Shared<lb/> and Integrated Care Record. Therefore, this is an opportune time for<lb/> policy-makers and other key stakeholders to review the learnings<lb/> from the implementations of health information technology (HIT)<lb/> both in Ireland and internationally.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, a vast amount of literature is published on topics such as<lb/> EHRs which renders it difficult for policy-makers to remain up-to-date<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[27,28]</ref>, perhaps amplifying the &quot;know-do&quot; gap. Additionally,<lb/> healthcare is a complex and adaptive system which needs to be<lb/> recognized and acknowledged when attempting to replicate successes<lb/> in another context <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>. The EHR programme in Ireland is also<lb/> already underway and therefore, it&apos;s critical that knowledge is<lb/> generated to provide actionable and relevant key considerations in a<lb/> timely manner aligned with the policy and decision-making cycles<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref>. Therefore, the aim of this review is to identify and explore the<lb/> key factors which promote a successful EHR implementation across<lb/> healthcare settings, with active collaboration from key stakeholders<lb/> in the Irish context.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Methods<lb/></head>

			<head>2.1. Design<lb/></head>

			<p>A rapid umbrella review was conducted and guided by the World<lb/> Health Organisation (WHO) practical guide for Rapid Reviews to<lb/> Strengthen Health Policy and Systems <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref>. Unlike a systematic review, an<lb/> umbrella review also known as a review of reviews, compiles evidence<lb/> from several research syntheses across different healthcare contexts and<lb/> stakeholder groups <ref type="biblio">[32,33]</ref>. Active collaboration with an expert panel of<lb/> knowledge users facilitated the acceleration of the systematic review<lb/> process <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref> and to facilitate uptake and use of these findings by plan-<lb/>ners and decision-makers, the synthesized findings were also presented<lb/> in a report format <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2. Expert panel of knowledge users<lb/></head>

			<p>A multi-disciplinary panel of experts and knowledge users (n = 10)<lb/> were engaged and involved throughout the review process to inform its<lb/> methodology, validate the generalizability and relevance of the review<lb/> findings <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref>, and ensure it reflects current thinking and is useful <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>.<lb/> The panel was convened in January 2019 by the Office of Nursing and<lb/> Midwifery Services Director (HSE) and comprised of those currently<lb/> involved in large HIT implementation projects across primary and sec-<lb/>ondary care at local and national levels in Ireland, as well as clinicians,<lb/> health service researchers and academic partners from healthcare and<lb/> health informatic backgrounds (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Five consultative in-person<lb/> group meetings and several individual meetings and email exchanges<lb/> within the group were conducted throughout the review process.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3. Research question and search strategy<lb/></head>

			<p>An initial exploratory scope of the EHR literature in the PubMed<lb/> database was reviewed by the expert panel and the final research<lb/> question, methodology and search strategy were developed and agreed.<lb/> A large number of search terms to describe &quot;Electronic Health Record&quot;,<lb/> &quot;Implementation&quot; and &quot;Literature Review&quot; were identified from previous<lb/> systematic reviews <ref type="biblio">[7,36-40]</ref>, additional literature <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>, medical sub-<lb/>ject heading and controlled vocabulary and via consultation with the<lb/></p>

Health<lb/> Service Executive (HSE), government-funded organisation responsible for the<lb/> provision of health and personal social services; UCD, University College Dublin;<lb/> Ireland East Hospital Group, one of seven hospital groups in Ireland comprising<lb/> of 11 hospitals and four community healthcare organisations; ICT, Information<lb/> Communication Technology; Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management<lb/> System (MN-CMS), an EHR for all women and babies being cared for across<lb/> maternity and new born services in Ireland; GPIT, General Practice Information<lb/> Technology; EPR, Electronic Patient Record.<lb/></figure>

			<p>expert panel and an experienced information technologist at the Health<lb/> Sciences Library, UCD <ref type="biblio">[Appendix]</ref>. The search string was tailored to the<lb/> indexing language of each database and in March 2019, it was executed<lb/> across PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore,<lb/> ACM Digital Library, ProQuest and Cochrane, with limitations of English<lb/> language and published since 2010. Grey literature including reports<lb/> and conference proceedings were also searched (international Health<lb/> Informatics Societies, the World Health Organization (WHO), European<lb/> e-health network, Kings Fund, Gartner and Lenus). Panellists also drew<lb/> on their expertise to identify any additional relevant sources <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4. Identification of literature reviews<lb/></head>

			<p>Identified articles were calibrated in the citation management soft-<lb/>ware Endnote version x9.2 and titles and abstracts were screened by one<lb/> researcher using the inclusion and exclusion criteria agreed with the<lb/> expert panel (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Full text articles were then accessed and screened<lb/> by the same researcher, with any doubts regarding inclusion or exclu-<lb/>sion discussed with the panel to overcome any risk of errors or in-<lb/>consistencies associated with using one reviewer <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref>. In line with our<lb/> chosen rapid review methodology, a quality assessment of identified<lb/> reviews was not conducted.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5. Data extraction and synthesis<lb/></head>

			<p>A standardized data extraction form was developed and included<lb/> authors, year of publication, study design, participants, healthcare<lb/> setting, included studies and findings related to factors impacting on the<lb/> implementation (i.e., themes and/or paragraphs as required). Following<lb/> data extraction, a qualitative content analysis of the factors impacting<lb/> on the EHR implementation was undertaken by the researcher <ref type="biblio">[41]</ref>.<lb/> Using an iterative process, a list of codes representing the identified<lb/> factors from each of the literature reviews was formed <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref>. The expert<lb/> panel reviewed these codes via an adapted nominal group technique,<lb/> which saw collated appraisals distributed amongst the panellists <ref type="biblio">[43]</ref> to<lb/> assess whether they were comprehensive of the literature and their own<lb/> experiences, and to determine whether the findings could be transferred<lb/> to Irish contexts and settings <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref>. Having reached a final consensus<lb/> regarding the factors for a successful EHR implementation, these factors<lb/> were further categorized into a theoretical framework <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref> and resulted<lb/> in the generation of key considerations <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Results<lb/></head>

			<head>3.1. Characteristics of literature reviews<lb/></head>

			<p>Of the 5,040 articles retrieved, 27 literature reviews were identified<lb/> which captured factors deemed important for the successful imple-<lb/>mentation of EHRs, as well as other HIT implementations (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/> Fifteen were classified as systematic reviews, whilst the others were<lb/> umbrella reviews (n = 3), scoping reviews (n = 2), interpretive review<lb/> (n = 1), literature review with a meta-narrative (n = 1) and other non-<lb/>systematic literature reviews (n = 5). Overlap in included publications<lb/> existed across the literature reviews with 974 unique studies, literature<lb/></p>

			<p>reviews, reports, books and guidelines identified. Perspectives of a va-<lb/>riety of stakeholders were captured in these reviews including GPs (or<lb/> primary care physicians), other doctors, nurses, health and social care<lb/> professionals (HCPs), patients, policymakers, vendors and IT consultants<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Although many literature reviews encompassed studies from a<lb/> variety of healthcare settings, others were specific to primary care (i.e.,<lb/> community) <ref type="biblio">[13,44,45]</ref>, long term care <ref type="biblio">[46]</ref> and mental health settings<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[47]</ref> or within specific countries or groups of countries <ref type="biblio">[19,48-51]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Synthesized findings<lb/></head>

			<p>Fifteen common factors were identified and classified as organiza-<lb/>tional, human and technological. Each of these factors are discussed in<lb/> detail below as well as how they interact within different contexts.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1. Organizational factors<lb/></head>

			<p>Factors relating to the processes by which the EHR was introduced<lb/> and incorporated into routine care were categorized as organizational<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[54]</ref>. Whilst each of the six factors were important across all contexts,<lb/> the size and type of organization impacted on how each triggered suc-<lb/>cess during the EHR implementation <ref type="biblio">[46,53,61]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1.1. Governance, leadership and culture.</head>

			<p>The governance of the EHR<lb/> implementation <ref type="biblio">[13,19,37]</ref>, as well as leaders <ref type="biblio">[7,10,36,44,48,52-54,62,<lb/> 63]</ref> and organizational culture, were identified as paramount in<lb/> ensuring a successful EHR system <ref type="biblio">[7,10,13,36,45,50-53,56,59,62]</ref>.<lb/> Whilst top-down, middle-out and bottom-up governance structures have<lb/> been utilised, ongoing political willingness, national policies and some<lb/> independence at an individual organizational level regarding EHR pro-<lb/>curement, development and design, were recommended to promote<lb/> engagement, usability and interoperability <ref type="biblio">[13,48,51,62]</ref>. It was also<lb/> important that executive leaders such as CIOs and project management<lb/> teams establish good and trusting relationships with vendors and<lb/> consulting firms <ref type="biblio">[12,44,52,56,63]</ref>, and designed the implementation<lb/> strategy with clear measurable objectives <ref type="biblio">[10,50,52]</ref>, a fitting imple-<lb/>mentation process (e.g., big-bang or phased) <ref type="biblio">[44,46,51,58]</ref>, and clear<lb/> roles and divisions of labour <ref type="biblio">[10,60]</ref>. A shift away from the dominance<lb/> of top and middle management has also been recommended <ref type="biblio">[10,19,36]</ref>,<lb/> with the appointment of local leaders or champions, and supporting of<lb/> internal and external communication and collaboration <ref type="biblio">[10,11,19,52,<lb/> 59]</ref>, innovation and continual improvement <ref type="biblio">[52]</ref>, and patient-centred<lb/> care <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>. This also helps to create a favourable <ref type="biblio">[10,36,44,63]</ref> and<lb/> flexible <ref type="biblio">[52]</ref> culture.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1.2. End-user involvement.</head>

			<p>During each stage of the EHR imple-<lb/>mentation process, end-user involvement was highlighted as important<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[7,10,37,47,48,52,54,56,57,60,62,63]</ref>, as it helps to ensure that the<lb/> EHR meets end-users&apos; needs and workflows, as well as promoting a sense<lb/> of ownership <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref> and acceptance amongst staff <ref type="biblio">[10,37,63]</ref>. Engaging<lb/> end-users from each stakeholder group was recommended <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>, and this<lb/> has often been done in the form of appointing champions. These leaders<lb/> should be respected amongst their colleagues as well as having the<lb/> relevant knowledge to act as a bridge between the end-users and IT staff<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[60,62,63]</ref>. However, champions may sometimes need to be shared be-<lb/>tween organizations <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1.3. Training.</head>

			<p>Basic computer and EHR-specific training were<lb/> identified as key to a successful EHR implementation <ref type="biblio">[7,10,12,13,19,36,<lb/> 37,45,46,48,50-53,56,57,60,61,63]</ref>. However, the effectiveness and<lb/> resource-efficiency of training depended on the appropriateness of the<lb/> appointed trainers, training content, timing of training (i.e., as close to<lb/> Go Live as possible <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>) and methods of training e.g., classroom based<lb/> versus eLearning <ref type="biblio">[57]</ref>. EHR training was also recommended on an<lb/> ongoing basis for new staff, as well as existing staff to optimize their use<lb/> of the system <ref type="biblio">[37,53]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1.4. Support.</head>

			<p>Expert, technical, executive and external support have<lb/> been critical to successful EHR implementations <ref type="biblio">[7,10-13,19,36,37,44,<lb/> 50-53,56-58,60-63]</ref>. Expert or peer support, often referred to as<lb/> super-users, reportedly helped end-users to optimize their use of the EHR<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[7,11,12,36,53]</ref>, whereas technical support staff helped solve IT issues<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[51,62]</ref>. During Go Live (often first 3-4 weeks <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>), technical and peer<lb/> support should be available 24/7 seven days a week in hospitals <ref type="biblio">[12,36]</ref>.<lb/> However, this may not be feasible or required in primary care centres<lb/> but channels to obtain support during working hours remain important.<lb/> Other crucial support comes from an executive or policy level <ref type="biblio">[19,50,52,<lb/> 53,56,57,60,63]</ref> and professional networks or external parties <ref type="biblio">[19,53]</ref>.<lb/> Although maintenance support for servers and networks was not as<lb/> evidenced in the identified literature <ref type="biblio">[50]</ref>, the expert panel also deemed<lb/> this as important.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1.5. Resourcing.</head>

			<p>The availability of resources in terms of finance,<lb/> skilled workforce and time was also important <ref type="biblio">[7,10,12,13,36,37,<lb/> 44-46,48,49,51-54,56,59-63]</ref>. Financial resourcing was often high-<lb/>lighted as a barrier especially by primary care doctors <ref type="biblio">[12,13]</ref> and those<lb/> in lower income countries <ref type="biblio">[48]</ref>, and scope creep of the budget was a<lb/> common occurrence for larger hospitals <ref type="biblio">[10,52,54]</ref>. Therefore, a cost<lb/> analysis which encompasses infrastructure, personnel, maintenance and<lb/> ongoing optimization was critical <ref type="biblio">[36,62]</ref>. Having a skilled workforce<lb/> in-house who understand the clinical workflows was also recommended<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[53,61]</ref> as it can reduce dependence on and cost of vendors <ref type="biblio">[12,36]</ref>.<lb/> However, this may not be feasible for smaller organizations, and larger<lb/> organizations also reportedly had issues with IT staff retention <ref type="biblio">[10,13,<lb/> 36,48,51]</ref>. Adequate time for end-user involvement and habituation to<lb/> the EHR was also vital <ref type="biblio">[7,10,12]</ref> to ensure organizational readiness <ref type="biblio">[7,<lb/> 13,51,53]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.1.6. Workflows.</head>

			<p>Inability of the EHR system to meet the workflows<lb/> of end-users and organizations was commonly cited as negatively<lb/> impacting on success <ref type="biblio">[7,10-12,36,37,51,52,54,56,62,63]</ref>, including<lb/> end-user efficiency, productivity, satisfaction and acceptance of the EHR<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[7,11,63]</ref>. Although replicating existing paper-based practices may<lb/> minimize disruptions for end-users <ref type="biblio">[7,13,19,62]</ref>, re-engineering of<lb/> workflows during digitization to make them safer and more efficient was<lb/> recommended <ref type="biblio">[19,62,63]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2. Human factors<lb/></head>

			<p>Ability of healthcare organizations to successfully adopt an EHR<lb/> system was largely determined by the individual end-users <ref type="biblio">[10,54]</ref>, and<lb/> three overarching human factors were identified.<lb/></p>

			<figure type="table">Table 3 (continued )<lb/> Author<lb/> (Year)<lb/> Design<lb/> Focus<lb/> Setting/<lb/> participants<lb/> Studies<lb/> Inclusion<lb/> criteria<lb/> Identified factors<lb/> interest in<lb/> computers<lb/> ecosystem<lb/> Privacy and<lb/> confidentiality<lb/> concerns<lb/> Note: EHR, Electronic health record; LTC, long-term care; HIT, Health Information Technology; OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development;<lb/> EFTA, European Free Trade Association; HCPs, Health and Social Care Professionals.<lb/></figure>

			<head>3.2.2.1. Skills and characteristics.</head>

			<p>IT skills as well as personal charac-<lb/>teristics of individuals impacted on the success of an EHR implementa-<lb/>tion <ref type="biblio">[10,12,50,51,53,56,58,60,62,13,19,36,37,44,47-49]</ref>. Assessing<lb/> computer literacy of end-users enabled provision of basic computer<lb/> training to those requiring it, prior to effective EHR training <ref type="biblio">[36,48]</ref>.<lb/> Whilst the research assessing the impact of age, gender and clinical<lb/> experience on acceptance of the EHR reported in the identified reviews<lb/> was inconclusive, personal traits such as being open-to-change and a<lb/> problem-solver appeared to contribute to success <ref type="biblio">[56,62]</ref>. However,<lb/> resistance to embracing the EHR could also be attributed to unusable<lb/> technology <ref type="biblio">[10,51]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2.2. Perceived benefits and incentives.</head>

			<p>Where individual end-users<lb/> perceived the EHR to positively impact on patient care and workload,<lb/> this reportedly facilitated a successful implementation <ref type="biblio">[10,12,50,51,56,<lb/> 58,60,13,19,36,37,44,47-49]</ref>. However, realistic benefits and time-<lb/>frames specific to the organization should be communicated with<lb/> end-users <ref type="biblio">[44,45,62]</ref>. Monetary incentives or penalties have also been<lb/> shown to be important, especially for privately-governed organizations<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[13,45,59]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.2.3. Perceived changes to the healthcare ecosystem.</head>

			<p>End-users&apos; con-<lb/>cerns with changes to data privacy and security, patient-clinician re-<lb/>lationships and their roles and responsibilities, appeared to negatively<lb/> impact on EHR implementations <ref type="biblio">[7,10,51,53,56,58,60-62,12,13,19,36,<lb/> 44,47-49]</ref>. These concerns may differ depending on the specific setting<lb/> and type of sensitive personal information being collected (e.g., mental<lb/> health) <ref type="biblio">[47]</ref>. Therefore, specific concerns and their causes of concerns<lb/> should be identified and addressed as soon as possible to mitigate their<lb/> impact on EHR implementations <ref type="biblio">[19,36]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3. Technological factors<lb/></head>

			<p>Six factors relating to the technology aspect of the EHR imple-<lb/>mentation were identified as critical to its success and were intrinsically<lb/> linked to the organizational and human factors.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3.1. Usability.</head>

			<p>EHR usability was deemed important across several<lb/> reviews <ref type="biblio">[7,10,11,13,36,37,44,46,47,49,51,52,54,58,60,62]</ref>, as it<lb/> impacted on end-user efficiency, patient-facing time <ref type="biblio">[12,13,37,53]</ref>,<lb/> quality of care <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>, patient-clinician relationships <ref type="biblio">[52]</ref> and safety <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>.<lb/> However, a simple and intuitive system in one setting may not be<lb/> transferrable to another, and therefore, end-user involvement in devel-<lb/>opment, design <ref type="biblio">[10,37,62]</ref> and usability testing were recommended at<lb/> each site <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>. Additionally, enabling personalization of the EHR<lb/> interface <ref type="biblio">[53]</ref> and access to legacy paper-based records <ref type="biblio">[50,51]</ref> as well<lb/> as consideration of data quality and accuracy <ref type="biblio">[13,44,51]</ref> with use of<lb/> health terminologies and classifications <ref type="biblio">[56]</ref> was recommended. How-<lb/>ever, usability needs to be balanced with security <ref type="biblio">[44]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3.2. Interoperability.</head>

			<p>To enable health information exchange both<lb/> within and across healthcare organizations, interoperability was iden-<lb/>tified as critical <ref type="biblio">[7,10-13,19,37,44,45,49-52,54,58,60,62]</ref>. Local<lb/> contextual factors within countries such as two tier and fully private<lb/> health systems, lack of employment of national standards <ref type="biblio">[45,53,62]</ref>,<lb/> inconsistent data capture in incompatible formats <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>, have rendered<lb/> the creation of a fully interoperable EHR as difficult. Therefore, tech-<lb/>nical standards and communication between organizations were rec-<lb/>ommended to ensure interoperability was built in from the outset<lb/> including for legacy and existing health IT systems <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3.3. Infrastructure.</head>

			<p>Procurement or enhancement of infrastructure,<lb/> including software (e.g., EHR, anti-viral), hardware (e.g., data-entry<lb/> devices, Wi-Fi, power outlets) and furniture, accounted for a large pro-<lb/>portion of the financial resourcing and were deemed critical for the<lb/> success of the overall EHR implementation <ref type="biblio">[10,12,56,62,63,36,47-53]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The existing and new hardware and software must be compatible with<lb/> the specific EHR product <ref type="biblio">45</ref> , reliable and functional <ref type="biblio">[13,36,44,53,56]</ref>,<lb/> and enable sufficient accessibility to the EHR for end-users <ref type="biblio">[36,45,52,<lb/> 56]</ref>. According to the expert panel and additional literature reviewed,<lb/> selection of mobile and stationary data-entry devices also require<lb/> consideration of vendor certification, healthcare setting (e.g., out-<lb/>patients versus isolation rooms), required functions and workflows (e.g.,<lb/> checklists versus long narrative notes), and end-user preferences for<lb/> usability.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3.4. Regulation, standards and policies.</head>

			<p>As stated earlier, national<lb/> and international standards as well as regulation and policies were<lb/> critical for interoperability and addressing privacy and security concerns<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[7,13,19,45,46,51,52,56,58,60,62,63]</ref>. Therefore, messaging and lan-<lb/>guage standards <ref type="biblio">[45,52,56]</ref>, as well as robust privacy laws and policies<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[13,44,52,56,62]</ref> were recommended. Where healthcare organizations<lb/> were permitted to procure their own EHR product, these standards<lb/> would likely be especially important.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3.5. Adaptability.</head>

			<p>Many of the literature reviews reported that<lb/> adaptability of the software was important to facilitate customization of<lb/> the EHR software to meet the needs of the end-users and organizations<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[10,36,37,50,51,53,54,62]</ref>. This reportedly required the software ven-<lb/>dors to be open to sharing code development data and willing to adapt<lb/> their product <ref type="biblio">[36,37,53]</ref>, and the organization to have access to a skilled<lb/> workforce with the capabilities to adapt the EHR to clinical workflows<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>. Where interoperability standards exist, the need for adaptations to<lb/> the software may be reduced <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2.3.6. Testing.</head>

			<p>Comprehensive testing of the system was critical to<lb/> ensure usability and safety <ref type="biblio">[7,10,37,54]</ref>, and was more commonly cited<lb/> as important by IT staff and management than by HCPs <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>. This<lb/> rigorous, resource-intensive, multi-step testing process of each EHR<lb/> function needed to be conducted within live environments with actual<lb/> end-users <ref type="biblio">[54]</ref> and should not be underestimated.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>This umbrella review distilled the large volume of evidence available<lb/> regarding the successful implementation of a national EHR and these<lb/> findings were corroborated by an expert panel as being relevant to the<lb/> Irish healthcare context. Fifteen key organizational, human and tech-<lb/>nological factors were identified as critical and by synthesizing the<lb/> findings from several stakeholder groups and clinical settings, such as<lb/> doctors in primary or secondary care <ref type="biblio">[11,13,45,53,58,61]</ref> and nurses in<lb/> a mental health setting <ref type="biblio">[47]</ref>, this review of reviews identified that each<lb/> of these factors were also relevant and important to EHR and other HIT<lb/> implementations across different healthcare contexts.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, between country differences including health service<lb/> management, politics, economics, regulation and socio-culture impact<lb/> on how the identified factors influence success. This was evident in the<lb/> literature reviews which largely focused on studies conducted in the<lb/> predominantly private health service in the USA where return on in-<lb/>vestment and productivity were perceived benefits and incentives of<lb/> EHRs or EMRs <ref type="biblio">[50,51,56]</ref>. Additionally whilst the governance approach<lb/> was identified as important, a successful approach in one country cannot<lb/> necessarily be replicated in another, as occurred in the UK where the<lb/> top-down approach successfully employed in the Netherlands resulted in<lb/> disengaged healthcare organizations across the UK <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. Therefore,<lb/> these factors need to be employed with consideration of the national<lb/> context and in the Republic of Ireland this will also require close<lb/> collaboration and communication across the co-existing public and<lb/> private health sectors <ref type="biblio">[64,65]</ref>, as well as with those in Northern Ireland<lb/> (UK). Additionally, European Union (EU) citizens may avail of health-<lb/>care from any member state under the Cross-Border Healthcare<lb/> Directive (2011/24/EU) and thus, efficient exchange of health data<lb/> across borders is a major priority <ref type="biblio">[66]</ref> and is a pillar of EU4Health<lb/> 2021-2027 <ref type="biblio">[67]</ref>. Therefore, the EU interoperability policies and<lb/> frameworks <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref> as well as standards such as the International Patient<lb/> Summary, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and stand-<lb/>ardised terminologies <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref> to support these frameworks need to be<lb/> employed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the expansion in internationally-recognised standards (e.<lb/> g., HL7 FHIR) and significant regulatory and financial incentives<lb/> created by the HITECH Act and &quot;Meaningful Use&quot; requirements in the<lb/> USA, factors such as Usability and Regulations, standards and policies<lb/> continue to be highlighted as important for success as opposed to<lb/> being assumed components of EHR products. Whilst the inclusion of<lb/> older studies by these reviews perhaps contributed to this, it is also<lb/> likely that standards and requirements alone will not ensure an<lb/> interoperable and usable EHR. In fact, it is the dynamic interaction<lb/> between each of the identified factors which promotes a successful<lb/> EHR <ref type="biblio">[68]</ref>. However, placing more emphasis on an individual factor<lb/> can reduce the resources required for others. For example, promoting<lb/> Usability and Standards can respectively reduce the burden of training<lb/> and support, as well as adaptability <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>. Additionally, this may be<lb/> achieved by advances in evidence and technology such as artificial<lb/> intelligence (AI) including automated testing <ref type="biblio">[69]</ref>, eLearning mod-<lb/>ules <ref type="biblio">[70,71]</ref>, and personalization of the EHR interface <ref type="biblio">[72]</ref>. There-<lb/>fore, it is recommended that those involved in each aspect of the<lb/> implementation process communicate throughout it and review the<lb/> latest evidence regarding technology including peer-reviewed publi-<lb/>cations and white papers.<lb/></p>

			<p>At a more local or meso level, the size of the organization, infra-<lb/>structure, organizational readiness and culture, capabilities and be-<lb/>liefs of the workforce, and available finance <ref type="biblio">[36,37]</ref>, were also<lb/> identified as important when considering the application of the<lb/> identified factors. Certain aspects of the internal context can also be<lb/> enhanced to improve the likelihood of EHR success such as employing<lb/> change management to create a clear and realistic vision of the EHR<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[73]</ref> and providing basic computer training <ref type="biblio">[36,48]</ref>. However, the<lb/> size of the organization and its workforce will likely remain more<lb/> limited compared to their larger counterparts <ref type="biblio">[10,37]</ref>. Therefore,<lb/> sharing of resources such as champions, support staff and trainers<lb/> between larger and smaller hospitals or primary care settings has<lb/> been recommended, with some countries creating networks or<lb/> encouraging collaboration between existing regional groups of<lb/> healthcare organizations <ref type="biblio">[73,74]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1. Strengths and Limitations<lb/></head>

			<p>Undertaking a rapid qualitative evidence synthesis requires accel-<lb/>eration of many of the research processes, is dependent on the reporting<lb/> in the original reviews <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref> and could risk losing the context and<lb/> complexity of the original research setting <ref type="biblio">[32,42,75]</ref>. Additionally, five<lb/> of the literature reviews were conducted by the same lead author which<lb/> could lead to bias of individual study inclusion. However, the inclusion<lb/> of literature reviews, consideration of the inclusion criteria of each<lb/> literature review and ongoing collaboration with an expert panel <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref>,<lb/> provided a degree of confidence regarding the coherence, relevance and<lb/> adequacy of the findings and their generalisability across healthcare<lb/> settings <ref type="biblio">[76]</ref>. Additionally, actively involving knowledge-users who<lb/> were undertaking HIT implementations led to the concurrent translation<lb/> of this knowledge into practice <ref type="biblio">[77]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>5. Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>The key organizational, human and technological factors identified<lb/> in this review provide policy-makers and other key stakeholders with a<lb/> foundation for making evidence-based decisions during the imple-<lb/>mentation of a fully interoperable EHR across primary, secondary and<lb/> long-term care. However, consideration of the specific contextual in-<lb/>fluences is critical to the successful application of these factors. Addi-<lb/>tionally, the end-users, existing technological standards and policies,<lb/> and advances in technology and research in the area, will impact on how<lb/> these factors dynamically interact during the EHR implementation and<lb/> will influence success.<lb/></p>
