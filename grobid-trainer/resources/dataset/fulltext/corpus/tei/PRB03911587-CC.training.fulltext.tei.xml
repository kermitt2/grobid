			<p>Magnetic impurities in conventional superconductors<lb/> strongly depress the superconducting transition tempera-<lb/>ture T,. But in the new high-T, cuprates La2Cu04 and<lb/> YBa2Cu30», in which superconductivity is believed to be<lb/> confined within Cu02 planes, T, is depressed whether Cu<lb/> is replaced by magnetic or diamagnetic ions. <ref type="biblio">&apos; 3</ref> For<lb/> YBa2Cu30», however, the study of this depression of T, is<lb/> complicated because there are two different copper sites<lb/> that the impurity can occupy, as opposed to La2Cu04,<lb/> where there is only one. The Bi-based high-T, materials<lb/> of general formula Bi2Sr2Ca&quot; iCu&quot;O» with n 1, 2, and<lb/> 3, where all the Cu atoms lie in Cu02 planes, &quot; is another<lb/> simpler system for studying the effect of magnetic impuri-<lb/>ties.<lb/></p>

			<p>All of the Bi-based superconductors have an incom-<lb/>mensurate structural modulation. <ref type="biblio">s</ref> We recently discussed<lb/> the crystal chemistry of this modulation within the 80-K<lb/> superconductor BizSr2CaCu20s+<lb/> (n=2) in a study of<lb/> 6<lb/> the isostructural commensurate Bi~oSr~5Fe~0046 phase.<lb/> This study showed that the modulation is caused by the<lb/> insertion of extra oxygen in a perovskite position within<lb/> the Bi layers. The Bi2Sr2CuO» phase (n l ), whose basic<lb/> unit cell has been found to be either orthorhombic<lb/> or<lb/> face-centered monoclinic, has a commensurate modula-<lb/>tion of the structure, and it is likely that the modulation<lb/> has the same origin in all the Bi phases, but the structures<lb/> of the various compounds must be solved to verify this hy-<lb/>pothesis.<lb/></p>

			<p>We have previously shown that Co and Fe can be sub-<lb/>stituted for Cu in the Bi2SrzCuO» phase. To address the<lb/> above questions of structural modulation and magnetism,<lb/> we have studied these substitutions on the Cu sites in more<lb/> detail. We have followed the evolution of magnetism and<lb/> the structural modulation as a function of the amount of<lb/> Cu replaced by Fe and Co. During this work, we syn-<lb/>thesized a structurally related Bi phase containing only<lb/> Co (Bi2Sr2CoO»), in both bulk or single-crystal form, and<lb/> solved its structure. We present both the structure and<lb/> the magnetic properties. We find that within this phase<lb/> the structural modulation is commensurate, and that the<lb/> magnetic properties suggest hidden ferromagnetism, simi-<lb/>lar to that found in La2Cu04 but with the canted com-<lb/>ponent of the spins lying in the CoOz planes.<lb/></p>

			<head>SYNTHESIS<lb/></head>

			<p>Samples of nominal composition BizSrzCu) -xM Oy<lb/> (M Co and Fe) were prepared by thoroughly mixing ap-<lb/>propriate amounts of the starting oxides and carbonates,<lb/> then heating the mixture in air for 24 h at temperatures<lb/> ranging from 860-900&apos;C and 900-950&apos;C when M Co<lb/> and Fe, respectively. Higher temperatures are required<lb/> for samples with increased doping content x. The reacted<lb/> powders were then pressed into pellets, reannealed in air<lb/> at the above temperatures for 24 h, and rapidly cooled (at<lb/> 10 /min) to room temperature.<lb/></p>

			<p>X-ray studies of the resulting samples summarized in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">I</ref> show that for M Co, single-phase materials are<lb/> obtained for all x. With M Fe the materials are multi-<lb/>phase for x greater than 0.6. The subcell parameters are<lb/> displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> as a function of x for the Bi2Sr2-<lb/> Cut -&quot;MO~series. The most prominent feature is the<lb/> sharp drop in the subcell volume at x 0.5 and x =0.25<lb/> for the Co and Fe series, respectively, which might indi-<lb/>cate subtle structural changes. The powder patterns for<lb/> samples close to the Fe composition, x=0. 25, show the<lb/> coexistence of two sets of lines, indicating a noncontinuous<lb/> structural change. This is in contrast with the Co series<lb/> where (within the accuracy of the measurements) we did<lb/> not detect coexistence of two phases for compositions close<lb/> to x =0.5.<lb/></p>

			<p>The atmosphere used during the processing of Bi2Sr2-<lb/>CoO~is important. When samples are annealed at 840&apos;C<lb/> under Ar, the structure is preserved, although the unit-cell<lb/> volume increases by 1 A . In contrast, when heated in ox-<lb/>ygen at 820&apos;C the material became multiphase as indi-<lb/>cated by its x-ray powder diffraction pattern which shows<lb/> two sets of Bragg peaks with the most intense ones corre-<lb/>sponding to the n =1 phase. Among the weak extra Bragg<lb/> peaks, the one at 28-6&apos; (for Cu radiation) suggests the<lb/> existence of another phase (denoted as the n-2 phase)<lb/> which will be discussed elsewhere. <ref type="biblio">&apos;</ref> This &quot;n 2&quot; phase<lb/> becomes predominant when lower reannealing tempera-<lb/>tures ( &amp; 800&apos;C) under oxygen are used.<lb/></p>

			<p>To determine the stability of the n=1 phase under<lb/> higher pressure of oxygen, we performed (as previously<lb/> reported for the synthesis of pure undoped BizSr2CuOp<lb/> hase&quot; ), solid-state reactions within sealed quartz am-<lb/></p>

			<p>poules using strontium peroxide as the source of Sr (to<lb/> produce a pressure of oxygen). From the volume of the<lb/> ampoule and the amount of Sr02, the pressure in the tube<lb/> was roughly estimated at 20 bars at temperatures of<lb/> 800 C. The Fe and Co series were made using this tech-<lb/>nique at temperatures of 860&apos;C and 840&apos;C, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>We found that Bi2Sr2Cu~-Co O~s ingle-phase materials<lb/> can only be obtained up to x 0.6, At higher Co concen-<lb/>trations, the material was multiphase containing the n =1<lb/> phase and a layered phase &quot;n =2 or 2:3:0:2&quot;with a c-axis<lb/> of 29.8 A. The amount of this layered phase was found to<lb/> increase with increasing Co content, so that no Bragg<lb/> peaks corresponding to the n 1 phase could be detected<lb/> in the x-ray powder diffraction pattern of the x= 1 sam-<lb/>ple. For the Fe series, a less crucial eA&apos;ect was observed,<lb/> since a range of solubility was found to exist from 0 to<lb/> 0.5~0.1 when the materials are prepared using Sr02 in<lb/> contrast to 0.6~0.1 when they are prepared in air. At<lb/> higher Fe concentrations we observed the formation of the<lb/> Bi2Sr3Fe209 2 (n =2) phase, whose structure has been dis-<lb/>cussed elsewhere.<lb/></p>

			<p>These experiments demonstrate that<lb/> the x, T, P(02) phase diagram for the stability of the<lb/> Bi2Sr2CoO~is quite complex because of the n 2 phase as<lb/> the competing phase. The main results are that (1)<lb/> single-phase Bi2Sr2CoO~materials can be obtained in air<lb/> at temperatures of 870~30 C or at lower temperatures<lb/> in partially reducing ambient and (2) that lowering the<lb/> synthesis temperature either in air or oxygen, or increas-<lb/>ing the oxygen pressure at T=800 C, always result in a<lb/> multiphase<lb/> sample.<lb/> Synthesis under oxygen usually<lb/> favors the high oxidation state of the metal elements<lb/></p>

			<p>within a compound. Thus the observation that the 2:2:0:1<lb/> is not stable under oxygen for high Co content or even in<lb/> air for high Fe content, suggests that the 2:2:0:1 phase<lb/> does not allow an oxidation state of Fe(Co) as great as the<lb/> 2:3:0:2,as we will confirm shortly.<lb/></p>

			<p>The oxygen content in this phase was determined<lb/> directly by thermogravimetric<lb/> measurements<lb/> (TGA) as<lb/> described elsewhere, &quot; or indirectly by chemical anal-<lb/>ysis. &apos; In the chemical method, the material is dissolved<lb/> in an acidified solution and the solution is titrated with a<lb/> second solution of Ce(SO4)2 (10 N). Ce + oxidizes<lb/> Co + to Co +, so the amount of Ce + consumed gives the<lb/> formal valence of Co and, thereby, the amount of oxygen,<lb/> assuming that Bi and Sr have a fixed valence of + 3 and<lb/> +2, respectively. By chemical analysis we found that the<lb/> formal valence for Co is 2.3+ 0.1, resulting in an oxygen<lb/> content of 6.15~0.05 per unit formula. A similar formal<lb/> valence for Co (within the accuracy of the titration) was<lb/> found for the material annealed under argon. TGA mea-<lb/>surements performed on several powdered samples and on<lb/> powdered single crystals consistently gave oxygen contents<lb/> ranging from 6.4 to 6.5. The discrepancy between the<lb/> chemical analysis and TGA may arise from loss of Bi dur-<lb/>ing the reduction under H2, because a reddish deposit was<lb/> observed along the wall of the TGA furnace during the<lb/> reduction experiment.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the hope of determining more quantitatively how<lb/> the n 1 Co phase is affected by ambient, several TGA<lb/> (weight-loss measurements) were performed with identi-<lb/>cal results. A TGA trace is reported in the inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">8<lb/></ref> for the Bi2Sr2CoO~phase heated in argon, cooled in ar-<lb/>gon, and then reheated in air. Note that up to tempera-<lb/>tures of 500&apos;C the weight loss (0.15%) of the sample<lb/> heated under argon is equal to its weight gain (0.15%)<lb/> when reheated under air, indicating a reversible intercala-<lb/>tion of 0.06 oxygen atoms per formula unit. At higher<lb/> temperatures the weight gain becomes smaller than the<lb/> weight loss, most likely due to a loss of Bi, which is quite<lb/> volatile at high temperatures, and especially so under vac-<lb/>uum. Thus, with respect to its oxygen affinity this com-<lb/>pound bears a striking similarity to Bi2Sr2CaCu20~and<lb/> La2CuO~for which a small ran~e of oxygen non-<lb/>stoichiometry (hy 0.04) was found.<lb/></p>

			<p>Crystals of the Bi2Sr2CoO~phase (either in platelet or<lb/> needlelike form) were prepared in a dense alumina cruci-<lb/>ble ( -, in. diam and 2 in. high) containing an 11 g charge<lb/> composed of 60% Bi203, 31% SrCO3, and 9% Co304 by<lb/> weight. The charge was heated in air to 1000&apos;C over a<lb/> period of 6 h, maintained at this temperature for 2 h,<lb/> slowly cooled to 700&apos;C at a rate of 6&apos;C per h, and then<lb/> removed from the furnace at this temperature. This treat-<lb/>ment partially melted the material. Within the charge<lb/> were large cavities containing free crystals (sizes ranging<lb/> from several micrometers to <ref type="biblio">3</ref> or 4 mm) that were used<lb/> for the structural and physical measurements reported<lb/> herein.<lb/></p>

			<p>An 8-pm-thick platelet with metallic luster and specu-<lb/>lar reflection was selected and turned out to be an ortho-<lb/>rhombic crystal with space group 12mb and cell parame-<lb/>ters a 21.836(5), b 5.4615(8), c 23.450(4) A. The<lb/> plane of the platelet was (002).<lb/></p>

		<p>The essential details of the structure data collection and<lb/> data reduction are given in Table <ref type="table">II</ref>. Direct methods fol-<lb/>lowed by least-squares refinement and difference-Fourier<lb/> maps gave the atomic positions in Table <ref type="table">III</ref>. The result-<lb/>ing metal positions are schematically shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. For<lb/> the BisSrsCo402s phase [or 2:2:0:1 (Co), for short], the<lb/> modulation along the a-axis is a fourfold multiplication of<lb/> the subcell parameter. In previously studied compounds,<lb/> the modulation was fivefold, in BiiSr2CuO~[2:2:0:1(Cu)]<lb/>(Ref. <ref type="biblio">8</ref>) and BiiSr3Fe20~[2:3:0:2(Fe)] (Ref. <ref type="biblio">6</ref>), or ap-<lb/>proximately fivefold, in Bi2Sr2CaCuzO~[2:2:1:2(Cu)].<lb/> <ref type="biblio">&apos;</ref><lb/></p>

			<p>gen content corresponds to a Co valence greater than +2,<lb/> again contrary to Ref. <ref type="biblio">8</ref>, which reported a Cu valence<lb/> below +2 in 2:2:0:1(Cu).<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref> shows the displacement along z produced<lb/> by the up-and-down flexing of the slabs. This flexing is al-<lb/>most purely sinusoidal with amplitude 0.5 and 0.3 A for<lb/> the Sr and Bi layers, respectively, but it is more distorted<lb/> for the Co layer, with obvious components from higher<lb/> harmonics. These harmonics stem from the displacement<lb/> of Co atoms toward the regions of the Bi layers where the<lb/> Bi is separated by oxygen in bridging positions (see<lb/> below). In a simple ionic picture of Bi +3 and 0 -2<lb/> point ions, those regions are more negative than the other<lb/> regions of the Bi-0 layers, where the oxygens are in rock-<lb/>salt positions, and they would be expected to attract p&apos;osi-<lb/>tive Co ions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">3(b)</ref> shows the associated compression and ex-<lb/>tension of the slabs along the a axis. In the 2:3:0:1(Fe)<lb/> phase, the Sr at the center of the perovskite slab showed<lb/> negligible compression, corresponding to a simple elastic<lb/> model where the center of the slab is at the so-called neu-<lb/>tral plane. Here, however, the Co atoms at the center of<lb/> the plane show some compression. Again, this may be due<lb/> to the negatively charged perovskite regions at the convex<lb/> part of the slabs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">4(a)</ref> shows the ideal oxygen distribution for<lb/> rocksalt and bridging types. The actual distribution [Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">4(b)</ref> l is disordered, and each oxygen site has 50% occu-<lb/>pancy. The reason for this disorder is probably that, con-<lb/>trary to the exhibited by the 2:2:0:1 (Cu), 2:2:I:2 (Cu),<lb/> and 2:3:0:2 (Fe) phases, the Bi atoms here do not form<lb/> ribbons, but are equally spaced along the y axis. There-<lb/>fore, more patterns of Bi-0 bonds become possible,<lb/></p>

			<p>perhaps producing domains or perhaps producing true dis-<lb/>order. Nevertheless, the mechanism of oxygen insertion<lb/> found in 2:3:0:2(Fe) is clearly recognizable here, in spite<lb/> of the disorder; the periodic alternation between the rock-<lb/>salt and the perovskite types allows a ninth oxygen row to<lb/> be inserted for every eight Bi rows.<lb/></p>

			<p>To determine the evolution of the structural modulation<lb/> upon increasing the doping content within the Bi2Srz-<lb/>Cu &amp; &quot;M&quot;O» series, transmission-electron-microscopy<lb/> studies were performed. Electron diffraction patterns ob-<lb/>tained with a 0.27-pm selected-area aperture, looking<lb/> down to the c axis, were collected for several samples and<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> displays the most representative ones. In order to<lb/> keep a consistent set of axes throughout for easy compar-<lb/>ison, the intense subcell reflections are indexed with the<lb/> 5.4&amp;&amp;5.4&amp;25 A F-centered orthorhombic subcell used for<lb/> example in Ref. <ref type="biblio">16</ref>. In all cases, with the a translation of<lb/> the subcell slightly shorter than b, the modulation occurs<lb/> along a. On the hk0 section, the substructure allows only<lb/> spots with It and k even due to the F centering of the lat-<lb/>tice. In order to index the superstructure reflections,<lb/> which are not the same in all cases, we used a second<lb/> reference system denoted by asterisks. The extra spots<lb/> due to the structure modulation along the a axis are la-<lb/>beled with h k0. For Bi2Sr2Co0~[pattern (d)l, in agree-<lb/>ment with the above x-ray single-crystal work the struc-<lb/>tural modulation is commensurate<lb/> with multiplicity 4.<lb/></p>

			<p>For Bi2Sr2CuO» [pattern (a)l, the structural modulation<lb/> is still commensurate, but with multiplicity 5, in agree-<lb/>ment with the work of Onoda and Soto.<lb/> For<lb/> Bi2Sr2Cu~-&quot;Fe&quot;O» with x 0.1 and 0.4 [patterns (b) and<lb/> (c), respectively], the structural modulation along the a<lb/> axis is incommensurate.<lb/></p>

			<p>A comparison of (a) and (d) reveals interesting<lb/> features. In Fig. <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref> for the pure Cu phase, there are<lb/> nine modulation spots equally spaced between the (000)<lb/> and (200) subcell reflections or between the (010) and<lb/> (210) subcell reflections, indicating a commensurate<lb/> modulation of multiplicity 5. On the other hand, Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">5(d)</ref> for the Co phase shows only three modulations spots<lb/> equally spaced between the (000) and (200) subcell<lb/> reflections and a few weak spots along (h 10), possibly due<lb/> to multiple reOections. This is consistent with the struc-<lb/>ture model established by x-ray diffraction shown in Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">5(f)</ref> for the Co phase, that the superstructure cell result-<lb/>ing from the a-axis modulation has a body-centered ar-<lb/>rangement, allowing only reflections with the sum of in-<lb/>dices even. The quasiabsence of reflections of the type<lb/> (h 10) for the Co phase (as compared to the Cu phase) is<lb/> due to the b-glide absence of the I2mb space group, but<lb/></p>

The electron beam is along the c axis and a<lb/> 0.27-pm selected-area aperature is used. The main diffractions<lb/> of the tetragonal subcell with a =b=0.54 nm are labeled with<lb/> hkO, while the additional diA&apos;ractions of the superstructure due<lb/> to the structural modulation along the a axis are labeled h*k0.<lb/> Schematic drawing of the superstructures in the a-c plane are<lb/> shown in (e) for Bi2Sr2CuO» (Ref. <ref type="biblio">8</ref>) and (f) for Bi2Sr2CoO»<lb/> from this work.<lb/></figure>

			<p>some weak multiple reflections are visible here. In other<lb/> words, the lowering of the extended unit-cell symmetry in<lb/> going from the Co to the Cu phase, i.e. , from Figs. 5(f) to<lb/> 5(e), allows more reflections, leading to the observed addi-<lb/>tional spots.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Bi2Sr2Cu~-&quot;FeO~series was also examined as a<lb/> function of the Fe composition. We find that the electron<lb/> diffraction patterns for low-Fe-content samples (0&amp; x<lb/> &amp; 0.2) [pattern (b) for example] are quite similar to that<lb/> of the undoped phase x =0, suggesting that the super-<lb/>structure is still monoclinic but with an incommensurate<lb/> modulation of periodicity 4.65~0.10. In contrast, the<lb/> electron diffraction patterns for higher-Fe-content sam-<lb/>ples 0.3 &amp; x &amp; 0.5 [pattern (c) for instance] bear a strik-<lb/>ing similarity to that of the pure Co phase, suggesting an<lb/> orthorhombic superstructure,<lb/> but the modulation is in-<lb/>commensurate with a periodicity of 4.3 0.1 instead of 4.<lb/> We noted that in Fig. <ref type="figure">5(c)</ref>, (h 10) spots with h* =odd<lb/> become clearly visible, an indication of the formation of<lb/> ribbons in the Bi layer, which are ruled out by the b glide<lb/> plane of the Co analog. In addition, there is a striking<lb/> similarity between these two patterns. It is interesting to<lb/> point out that the Fe (x 0.5) and full Co-doped phase<lb/> have the same unit-cell volume and a similar modulation<lb/> periodicity, and also note that the value of x at which the<lb/> sharp drop in the subcell volume is observed also corre-<lb/>sponds to the composition at which a drastic change in the<lb/> modulation<lb/> periodicity associated with a monoclinic-<lb/>orthorhombic transition was found.<lb/></p>

Temperature dependence of the susceptibility for<lb/> several members of the Bi2Sr2Cul -Co~0&quot;series. The data<lb/> were collected on warming the samples in a field of 500 G.<lb/></figure>

			<p>The superconducting<lb/> properties of the Co-and Fe-<lb/>doped Bi2Sr2Cu~-M&quot;O~samples were investigated using<lb/> an ac mutual inductance apparatus. None of the doped<lb/> samples were superconducting<lb/> down to below 4.2 K in<lb/> contrast to the undoped material which shows a T, of 10<lb/> K.<lb/></p>

			<p>The magnetic susceptibility measurements were per-<lb/>formed for several members of the Bi2Sr2Cu~&quot;Co&quot;Os<lb/> eries over the temperature range 4.2-300 K. At low Co<lb/> concentrations, the temperature dependence was Curie<lb/> type over the entire temperature range (data not shown).<lb/></p>

			<p>For x 0.5, a Curie temperature dependence is only<lb/> obeyed above 100 K (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), and at higher concentra-<lb/>tions, the susceptibility develops a cusp, suggesting an an-<lb/>tiferromagnetic ordering. With increasing Co content, the<lb/> amplitude of this cusp increases and the temperature at<lb/> which it occurs (Tv ) shifts only slightly to lower tempera-<lb/>ture; for Bi2Sr2CoO» (x 1), TN 150 K. Well above<lb/> T~, the susceptibility can be 6t to a Curie-%&apos;eiss law of<lb/> general formula gg Cg(T+e~)+go where Cg, e~, and<lb/> go are the Curie constant, the paramagnetic Curie tem-<lb/>perature, and the temperature-independent<lb/> susceptibility,<lb/> respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">7)</ref>. Fits over the range of temperature<lb/> 250-400 K and 300-400 K led, respectively, to the follow-<lb/>ing parameters p,a 2. 4ptt, e~-130 K, and a root-<lb/>mean-square deviation from the Curie-Weiss law (sigma)<lb/> of 0.2% and p,a 3.01ptt, e~-78, , cr 0.1%. Caution<lb/></p>

				<figure>Temperature (K)<lb/> FIG. 7. The variation of the susceptibility from 4.2 to 400 K<lb/> in a field of 1 kG is shown for a Bi2SrqCoO~sample. Crosses<lb/> refer to the data points. The solid line is a fit of the data to a<lb/> Curie-Weiss law with the parameters given in the text. Also<lb/> shown is the 1/g vs temperature plot from which the eff&apos;ective<lb/> magnetic momentum per Co atom and the paramagnetic Curie<lb/> temperature, reported in the text, were deduced.<lb/></figure>

			<p>should be exercised in interpreting these results, as the<lb/> lack of data above 400 K makes the values of p,tr underes-<lb/>timated. If there is 2D behavior as in La2Cu04, where an<lb/> upturn of the susceptibility (due to short-range antiferro-<lb/>magnetic order within the Cu02 planes) was observed<lb/> below 1000 K, &apos; the values of e~c an be meaningless. In<lb/> both cases, however, the values of -e~a re positive, indi-<lb/>cating (within the range of temperature investigated) the<lb/> presence of ferromagnetic interactions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The eA&apos;ective<lb/> magnetic moment of 3.01@8 found for Co is smaller than<lb/> that expected (3.9) for high-spin Co + (S 2 ) or (4.9)<lb/> for Co3+ high-spin (S 2) and greater than that expected<lb/> (1.7) for low-spin Co + (S -, &apos; ) or (0) for low-spin Co +<lb/> (S 0). Thus, the valence of Co cannot be simply deter-<lb/>mined from magnetic measurements.<lb/></p>

			<p>Magnetic transitions are usually sensitive to changes in<lb/> compositions, which can be caused by changes in process-<lb/>ing. This is also true for the BiqSr2CoO~phase. A sample<lb/> processed in air at T 890 C (denoted A) has a TIv of<lb/> 150 K, and by lowering the annealing temperature of the<lb/> sample in air to 840 C, we found that T~moves to higher<lb/> temperatures (up to 270 K). This ordering temperature<lb/> decreases to 100 K when the compound is treated at<lb/> 800&apos;C under argon (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). When such a sample is an-<lb/>nealed under oxygen, as reported in the experimental sec-<lb/>tion, another phase forms that has no magnetic order so<lb/> that the magnetic transition vanishes (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Such a<lb/> large dependence of the magnetic ordering temperature<lb/> on stoichiometry also occurs for other perovskites, such as<lb/> La2Cu04, &apos; &apos; La2Ni04,<lb/> or YBa2Cu30$.<lb/> For<lb/> both La2Cu04 and YBa2Cu30s, however, Tlv is shifted to<lb/> lo~er temperatures with increasing oxygen content, the<lb/> opposite of what we observe here. We also found that the<lb/> antiferromagnetic ordering temperature in Bi2Sr2CoO~is<lb/> lowered if the materials are made with cobalt deficiency,<lb/> indicating again that there is a close correlation between<lb/> composition and magnetic properties for this compound.<lb/></p>

			<p>(without hysteresis). As the temperature decreases, this<lb/> sudden increase in magnetization is smeared and shifted<lb/> to higher fields, and hysteresis develops. This is reminis-<lb/>cent of a metamagnetic state or hidden ferromagnetism as<lb/> has been recently reported for LaqCu04.<lb/> Two oriented crystals were investigated for magnetism<lb/> with identical results. Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref> shows the susceptibility<lb/> (uncorrected for demagnetization)<lb/> for several rectangu-<lb/>larlike crystals (of overall weight 2.6 mg and of overall di-<lb/>mensions 4X 1 X0.1 mm ), with the applied field parallel<lb/> to the a, b, and c crystallographic directions. When the<lb/> applied field is parallel to a, clear evidence for antifer-<lb/>romagnetism is observed at T~= 150 K. But, in addition<lb/> a well-defined peak of lower amplitude [which is barely<lb/> detectable when the measurements are performed on bulk<lb/> (see, for instance, inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>)) shows up at T 100 K.<lb/></p>

			<p>This peak may be either due to impurities or is intrinsic to<lb/> the compound.<lb/></p>

			<p>For instance, two magnetic transitions<lb/> were found within the layered LaqCo04.~Experiments<lb/> are in progress to determine the origin of this peak, and<lb/> we will not comment any further. However, a rather<lb/> striking feature of Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref> is the large difference in the<lb/> amplitude of the susceptibility both above and below TJv,<lb/> depending on the orientation of the applied field. Such a<lb/> large difference most likely arises from a large crystalline<lb/> anisotropy, as expected from the structure. When the ap-<lb/>plied field is parallel to c, the susceptibility above and<lb/> below TIv does not change significantly, indicating that it<lb/> is difficult to move the spins out of the planes, and already<lb/> defining the orientation of the spins (within the ab plane).<lb/></p>

			<p>The large anisotropy of the susceptibility above T&amp;<lb/> (g4oolia and g4oollb &amp; g4oollc) is also suggestive that<lb/> BiqSrzCoO~may be an Ising or A&apos;Y antiferromagnet.<lb/> This<lb/> anisotropy in the susceptibility, where the field along c<lb/> gives the smallest signal, is opposite to that found by Thio<lb/></p>

			<p>et al. on La2Cu04 (in their crystal, a field parallel to b is<lb/> equivalent to a field parallel to c in our crystal). Resistivi-<lb/>ty measurements on a Bi2Sr2CoO» lamellarlike aggregate<lb/> (consisting of several plateletlike crystals) from the same<lb/> batch as used for magnetic measurements is shown in Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">10(a)</ref>. The resistivity increases with decreasing tempera-<lb/>ture indicative of a semiconducting or insulating regime.<lb/></p>

			<p>Note a change in the rate at which the resistivity increases<lb/> at T 180~10 K. It is interesting to note that it is over<lb/> the same temperature range that a magnetic transition is<lb/> observed suggesting that both are related. We should<lb/> point out that similar measurements made on sintered pel-<lb/>lets gave greater values for the resistivity at room temper-<lb/>ature (on the order of 20 0 cm instead of I for the crys-<lb/>tal), and also no anomalies in the temperature-depen-<lb/>dence resistivity curve were observed, even though the<lb/> same sample shows a magnetic transition.<lb/></p>

			<p>Such dif-<lb/>ferences may be due to grain boundaries and/or inhomo-<lb/>geneities problems, always greater in bulk than in crystals.<lb/></p>

			<p>To further investigate the magnetic anomaly observed<lb/> in the susceptibility, neutron diffraction was performed on<lb/> a powder sample. This sample was prepared in air at<lb/> 840 C in contrast to 890&apos;C for the previous sample<lb/> denoted A, thus explaining the difference in Tiv between<lb/> both samples. Here we briefly present some of the results;<lb/> more details will be published elsewhere. 6 Various anti-<lb/>ferromagnetic refiections of the type IOL were observed at<lb/> low temperature. This cell indexing refers to the subcell<lb/> of dimensions 5.459 &amp;&amp; 5.462 x 23.45 A. , where the a axis is<lb/> one-quarter of that in the modulated structure. Figure <ref type="figure">11<lb/></ref> shows the temperature dependence of the (102) magnetic<lb/> peak which exhibits a Neel temperature of T~270 K, in<lb/> agreement with the susceptibility (measured on the same<lb/> sample) shown in the inset. The intensity does not fall<lb/> abruptly to zero at T&amp;. This smearing of T~may be due<lb/> to critical scattering or to inhomogeneities in the sample,<lb/> because, as already noted, Tz is sensitive to composition<lb/> changes. From the observed magnetic intensities, the spin<lb/> structure (Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>, inset) has spins lying in the plane per-<lb/>pendicular to c, in agreement with the susceptibility data.<lb/> The spins point perpendicular to the direction of the anti-<lb/>ferromagnetic wave vector, z, which is along either the a<lb/> or b axis. The difference between a and b cannot be<lb/> resolved directly from the subcell peaks due to the near<lb/> tetragonality of the substructure. However, because of<lb/> the structural modulation, we also observe superlattice<lb/> refiections which are purely magnetic in character. From<lb/> these, we can conclude<lb/> that the spins point along the b<lb/> axis, perpendicular to the structural modulation direction.<lb/></p>

			<p>We have also studied the magnetic properties of Bi2-<lb/>Sr2Cu~-&quot;Fe&quot;O», which turns out to be simpler than for<lb/> the Co series. For the undoped material the susceptibility<lb/> is temperature independent.<lb/></p>

			<p>As Cu is replaced by Fe a<lb/> Curie-Weiss behavior develops. No anomalies are ob-<lb/>served in the curves of g vs T [Fig. <ref type="figure">12(a)</ref>], suggesting that<lb/> there are no magnetic transitions. Over the range of tem-<lb/>perature 200-350 K the data can be successfully fitted to<lb/> a Curie-Weiss law as described above, giving an effective<lb/> magnetic moment p,g 5.13pg per Fe atom.<lb/></p>

		<p>From this moment, it is again impossible to unambigu-<lb/>ously ascribe a valence to Fe. Thus, the Fe Mossbauer<lb/> effect was used to study the electronic valence state of Fe<lb/> and the local structure in Bi2Sr2Cuo5Feo50». The Fe<lb/> Mossbauer absorption spectrum was obtained in a stan-<lb/>dard transition geometry with a conventional constant ac-<lb/>celeration spectrometer using a Co in Rh source. The<lb/> room-temperature<lb/> Mossbauer spectrum is shown in Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">12(b)</ref>. The spectrum shows four resonance lines due to<lb/> two nonequal quadrupole interactions, indicating that the<lb/> iron ions are in two inequivalent sites (denoted as Fei and<lb/> Fez). The intensity of the two different quadrupole lines<lb/> are in the ratio 4:3.

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>This study of the Bi2Sr2Cui -, M&quot;O» system has shown<lb/> that there is a subtle and delicate balance between compo-<lb/>sition, structural, and physical properties. The transport<lb/> and magnetic properties of these materials are determined<lb/> by the electronic state of each element in the material. In<lb/> chemical terms, these properties are determined by the<lb/> valence or oxidation state and spin state of each element<lb/> and the nature of the bonding, ionic or covalent; in physi-<lb/>cal terms, they are determined by the nature of the wave<lb/> function at the Fermi level (the degree of hybridization of<lb/> the 3d metal orbitals with oxygen 2p levels, for example).<lb/> The following discussion addresses these properties. In<lb/> some oxides, bismuth can adopt either the valence 3+ or<lb/> 5+ or both, as the result of the hybridization of the Bi 6s<lb/> and 0 2p levels. This possibility is ruled out here, since<lb/></p>

			<p>x-ray photoemission measurements<lb/> on the Bi cuprate<lb/> phases, either undoped or doped with Co or Fe, have<lb/> shown that Bi is only +3 in these phases. En agreement<lb/> with these measurements,<lb/> band-structure<lb/> calculations<lb/> show that the Bi 6s band is well below the Fermi level and<lb/> the Bi 6p band well above, thereby implying Bi +. Furth-<lb/>ermore, the Bi-0 stereochemistry from the crystal studies<lb/> does not correspond to Bi +.<lb/></p>

			<p>The subcell of the new Bi2Sr2CoO» compound is iso-<lb/>structural to that of the 10-K phase. Both compounds<lb/> contain MO2 layers with elongated CuOs or Co06 octahe-<lb/>dra and crystallographically sheared Bi-0 layers. The full<lb/> structure, however, differs because the periodicity of the<lb/> structural modulation is four subcells for Co and five for<lb/> Cu. The structural modulation in Bi2Sr2CoO» is caused<lb/> by the insertion of one extra row of oxygen atoms for<lb/> every eight rows of Bi atoms, as in Bi2Sr3Fe20», where<lb/> one extra row of oxygen is inserted in every ten rows of Bi.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a result, the oxygen content for Bi2Sr2CoO», which<lb/> would be 24 if the Bi slabs were 100% rocksalt structure,<lb/> is increased to 25, or one extra oxygen for every four Co<lb/> atoms. A simple valence count (assuming Bi + and Sr +)<lb/> gives the formal valence of Co as 2.50 (50% of Co + and<lb/> 50% of Co +). Within the Cu phase where the structural<lb/> modulation is five, there should be (according to our mod-<lb/>el ) an extra oxygen for every five Cu atoms, leading to a<lb/> formal valence of Cu of 2.4, compared to 2.2 obtained<lb/> from chemical analysis.<lb/> In Bi2Sr2CuO», the Cu 3d levels<lb/> mix with oxygen 2p levels so that the electrons collectively<lb/> give rise to both metallic behavior and to temperature-<lb/>independent susceptibility [Fig. <ref type="figure">12(a)</ref>]. In moving to the<lb/> left of Cu in the Periodic Table, the energy difference be-<lb/>tween the metal 3d levels and oxygen 2p levels increases<lb/> so that the orbital overlap decreases, resulting in a locali-<lb/>zation of the d-like electrons and producing an insulator.<lb/> This applies to the BiqSrqCoO» phase (Co left of Cu in the<lb/> Periodic Table), since both insulating and paramagnetic<lb/> behavior are observed. However, Co has a mixed valence,<lb/> and in a localized electron regime, one normally expects<lb/> two diA&apos;erent sites or environments for Co, as in Co304. It<lb/> is suggestive that for two of the four Co in the structure of<lb/> Bi2Sr2CoO» (Co-1 and Co-4 in Table III), the Co is shift-<lb/>ed toward one of the two apical oxygens on the distorted<lb/> CoOs octahedron, so that this Co-0 distance is almost as<lb/> short as the four Co-0 distances to the four equatorial ox-<lb/>ygens. Thus, two of the Co atoms are nearly fivefold coor-<lb/>dinated, while the other two are fourfold coordinated, in-<lb/>dicating that two different sites for Co exist within the<lb/> structure.<lb/> (Two different sites are also seen in the<lb/> Mossbauer results for the Bi2Sr2Cuo 5Feo 50» compound. )<lb/> Thus, with two structural Co sites, the insulating behavior<lb/> of Bi2Sr2CoO» in which Co has the formal valence 2.5 is<lb/> not so surprising. In this compound, a formal valence of<lb/> Co below +3 is also consistent with the fact that<lb/> Bi2Sr2CoO» must be synthesized in a reducing atmo-<lb/>sphere, not an oxidizing one. A reducing atmosphere<lb/> might be expected to favor Co + whereas an oxidizing at-<lb/>mosphere stabihzes the n =2 phase, in which, by analogy<lb/> to the Fe compound, the valence of Co is probably +3.<lb/> Now we consider the lattice parameters for the Fe-and<lb/> Co-doped BiqSr2Cui &quot;M&quot;O» series. In both series, the<lb/> unit-cell volume does not change continuously, but drops<lb/> sharply from 705 to 699 A&apos;, at x =0.25 for Fe and x 0.5<lb/> for Co. Lattice instabilities or changes in the electronic<lb/> state or spin configuration of the 3d metal ions generally<lb/> account for such sharp changes in unit-cell volume. For<lb/> instance, increasing the oxidation state of an ion or chang-<lb/>ing its spin configuration from high spin (HS) to low spin<lb/> (LS) reduces its ionic radius and thereby the unit-cell<lb/> volume of the compound containing this ion. On the other<lb/> hand, sudden changes in the electronic state of the 3d<lb/> metal ions should produce equally drastic changes in the<lb/> effective magnetic moment per 3d metal ion, and such<lb/> changes in the moment per Co or Fe were not observed for<lb/> either the Co or Fe series. It is more likely, therefore, that<lb/> lattice instabilities cause the sharp drops in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. These<lb/> instabilities<lb/> may simply be related to the observed<lb/> structural change (monoclinic-orthorhombic)<lb/> associated<lb/> with the sudden change in the periodicity of the structural<lb/> modulation from 5 to 4 observed in going from the Cu to<lb/> the Co system, thereby suggesting a noncontinuous<lb/> change of the modulation. Among the Bi compounds, the<lb/> structural modulation determines the oxygen content and<lb/> thereby the valence of the 3d metal. Moreover, we have<lb/> shown that Fe enters the structure as a + 3 ion whereas<lb/> Co has an average valence of 2.5 in the fully-doped com-<lb/>pound. Thus if the structural modulation occurs at some<lb/> specific valence of M, it should occur at a value of x half<lb/> as large in the Fe series as in the Co series, as observed.<lb/></p>

			<p>We turn now to the magnetism in Bi2Sr2CoO». We<lb/> found for this phase a 3D antiferromagnetic transition<lb/> which, depending on the stoichiometry and processing of<lb/> the samples, occurs over a range of temperature from<lb/> 100-280 K. Within the CoOq planes, the CoOs elongated<lb/> octahedra share corners, so that superexchange Co-0-Co<lb/> interactions rather than direct Co-Co exchange interac-<lb/>tions probably determine the magnetic interactions. Thus,<lb/> one would expect the magnetic transition to be sensitive to<lb/> stoichiometry of oxygen or cobalt, as we observe experi-<lb/>mentally.<lb/></p>

			<p>The sharpness of the susceptibility peak at the Neel<lb/> temperature is suggestive of a ferromagnetic component<lb/> among the magnetic interactions. This is also supported<lb/> by the field-dependent magnetization curves collected at<lb/> constant temperature below Tlv which show a step at a<lb/> critical field denoted H, . For applied fields greater than<lb/> H, and up to 5 T we did not reach a saturation in magne-<lb/>tization. A similar behavior was observed for La2Cu04. &quot;<lb/></p>

			<p>It was ascribed to a fiip of the small component of the Cu<lb/> spins normal to the Cu02 layers.<lb/></p>

			<p>&apos; However, the peak<lb/> in susceptibility was seen for fields normal to the plane,<lb/> whereas here it is largest for fields in the plane, suggesting<lb/> that the canted component of the spins lies in the plane in<lb/> our case. A comparison of the field-induced magnetiza-<lb/>tion data for La2Cu04 (see figure in Ref. <ref type="biblio">24</ref>) with that of<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> for Bi2Sr2CoO» indicates that in both materials<lb/> the field-induced antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic<lb/> (AF-<lb/>F) transition occurs at the same field (3-4 T), and that<lb/> the amplitude of this transition when reported in pg per<lb/> Co atom is of the same order, leading to the belief that the<lb/> energy required for the transition is similar in both ma-<lb/>terials. For La the canting is out of the plane in contrast<lb/> to in the plane with Bi phase (i.e. , for La the AF-F transi-<lb/>tion involves a reorientation of a small ferromagnetic mo-<lb/>ment in alternate sheets, whereas in the Bi compound ac-<lb/>cording to our results it involves a reorientation of a small<lb/> ferromagnetic moment within the Co02 layer). Usually<lb/> one expects the interlayer coupling to be much weaker<lb/> than the intralayer coupling. Our results do not seem to<lb/> support this point. At present we cannot qualitatively ex-<lb/>plain such a difference which may be related to the cant-<lb/>ing transition (i.e. , symmetry of the spin system) which is<lb/> more complicated, due to the structural modulation, for<lb/> the Co phase than for the La2Cu04 compound. Also, it<lb/> turns out that there are four different Co atoms in the su-<lb/>perstructure, and perhaps not all of them are canted in the<lb/> same way.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to this metamagnetic behavior, the elastic<lb/> neutron-scattering<lb/> data shows that the spin structure of<lb/> Bi2Sr2CoO» is similar to La2Cu04, since the antiferro-<lb/>magnetic wave vector and the spin direction are perpen-<lb/>dicular, with the spins pointing along the I» axis. Alterna-<lb/>tively, the anisotropy in the susceptibility above T~sug-<lb/>gests XYor Ising behavior as in La2Co04. Thus, further<lb/> neutron-scattering<lb/> experiments on single crystals would<lb/> be useful to look for 2D correlations above T~and to<lb/> study the inelasticity of the scattering.<lb/> In summary, we have reported the synthesis of new Bi-<lb/>based phases Bi2Sr2Cu~&quot;M0» (M =Fe, Co) which<lb/> have .similar structure to the IO-K superconducting<lb/> Bi2Sr2CuO» phase. The substitution of Cu by Co reduces<lb/> the structure modulation (caused by the uptake of an oxy-<lb/>gen atom every ten or eight Bi rows) from 5 to 4. But<lb/> based on the study of Fe and Co solid solutions, it appears<lb/> that this structural transition is discontinuous. This might<lb/> account for the difficultie encountered in removing oxy-<lb/>gen from these materials. The fully doped Co material<lb/> (Bi2Sr2CoO») is an antiferromagnetic<lb/> insulator with a<lb/> Neel temperature sensitive to deviation from stoichio-<lb/>metry and with a magnetic phase transition suggesting Is-<lb/>ing critical behavior. However, further work remains to<lb/> be done in order to determine the origin of the metamag-<lb/>netic state in this compound and to better understand the<lb/> role of the structural modulation on the magnetic proper-<lb/>ties.</p>
