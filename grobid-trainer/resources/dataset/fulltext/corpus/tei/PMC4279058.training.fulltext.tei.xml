			<p>Fatty acid vesicles are an important part of protocell<lb/> models currently studied <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>. As protocells can be<lb/> considered as pre-biological precursors of cells <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>, the<lb/> models try to contribute to a better understanding of<lb/> the (cellular) origin of life and emphasize on 2 major as-<lb/>pects: compartmentalization and replication <ref type="biblio">[2,4-6]</ref>. It<lb/> has been demonstrated that lipid-based membranes are<lb/> amenable to growth and division <ref type="biblio">[1,7]</ref>. Small unilamellar<lb/> vesicles divide after micelle addition <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. Autocatalytic<lb/> self-replicating micelles are formed from amphiphiles gen-<lb/>erated from the alkaline hydrolysis of ethyl caprylate (shell<lb/> replication) <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. Furthermore compartmentalization cre-<lb/>ates a unique micro-environment in which biomolecules<lb/> can accumulate <ref type="biblio">[9,10]</ref> and reactions can occur <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. Pio-<lb/>neering research by Sugawara <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>, Deamer <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>, Luisi <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>,<lb/> Szostak <ref type="biblio">[7,14,15]</ref> and Rasmussen <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref> gave more insight<lb/> in obtaining autocatalytic, self-replicating vesicles capable<lb/> of containing and reproducing nucleic acid sequences<lb/> (core replication).<lb/></p>

			<p>Linking both core and shell replication is a challenging<lb/> feat requiring thorough understanding of membrane dy-<lb/>namics <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref> and (auto)catalytic systems <ref type="biblio">[4,17]</ref>. A possible<lb/> solution may lie in a class of compounds called nucleoli-<lb/>pids, who combine a nucleoside, nucleotide or nucleo-<lb/>base with a lipophilic moiety. Early contributions by the<lb/> group of Yanagawa <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> mentions the prebiotic signifi-<lb/>cance (as a primitive helical template) arising from the<lb/> supramolecular organization of these compounds. Fur-<lb/>ther contributions, exploring the supramolecular scope<lb/> regarding phospoliponucleosides (e.g. 5 -dioleylphospha-<lb/>tidyl derivatives of adenosine, uridine and cytidine) can<lb/> be accounted to Baglioni, Luisi and Berti. This emerging<lb/> field of amphiphiles is being investigated for surface be-<lb/>havior, supramolecular assembly and even drug ability<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[19,20]</ref>. Besides improving permeability, modifying medi-<lb/>cinally active nucleosides or nucleotides with long alkyl<lb/> chains has proven (also by our group) to be an adequate<lb/> prodrug tactic <ref type="biblio">[10,21]</ref>.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>Now we designed of a series of nucleolipids as possible<lb/> activated precursors for obtaining oligonucleotides. Besides<lb/> its role as supramolecular recognition element ensuring<lb/> the vicinity of the nucleophilic 2′-and 3′-hydroxyl groups<lb/> and the electrophilic (activated) phosphate, it is necessary<lb/> that the lipid part of the conjugate is also a good leaving<lb/> group. This may be achieved by intramolecular catalysis; as<lb/> we have recently demonstrated that a carboxylic acid func-<lb/>tion introduced in α-position of a phosphoramidate or<lb/> phosphodiester group may help in catalyzing the cleavage<lb/> of the phosphoramidate or phosphodiester bonds. This oc-<lb/>curs by means of a cyclic intermediate that forms under<lb/> (mild) acidic conditions (Scheme <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). One must also con-<lb/>sider the competing acidic hydrolysis (Scheme <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) and<lb/> cleavage of the ester bond between nucleoside and phos-<lb/>phate (not depicted). Previous results have shown that the<lb/> cleavage ratio of Nucleoside-O-P and P-X-leaving group<lb/> depends on the nature of the latter bond, the leaving group<lb/> (with or without nearby carboxyl group), nucleobase and<lb/> pH (a more detailed discussion of these factors can be<lb/> found in the work of Maiti et al <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Depending on the cleaved bond, this might lead to<lb/> oligonucleotide formation due to the leaving group prop-<lb/>erties of the lipid moiety or through the formation of cyc-<lb/>lic nucleotides, (e.g. 3′-5′ cyclic GMP) which are able to<lb/> polymerize in water to give short RNA fragments <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>. As<lb/> the properties of the phospholipids with and without nu-<lb/>cleoside are different, the potential of obtaining a dynamic<lb/> system is present.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here, we have investigated the potential of α/β-hydroxy<lb/> fatty acids and α-amino fatty acids, covalently bound to<lb/> nucleoside-5′-monophosphates via a hydroxyl or an amino<lb/> group on the fatty acid (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) to spontaneous self-<lb/>assemble in spherical aggregates. Their stability towards<lb/> intramolecular cleavage was examined and thus their<lb/> ability to function as (activated) monomer for oligo-<lb/>nucleotide synthesis was assessed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results and discussion<lb/> </head>
				
			<head>Chemistry<lb/></head>

			<p>Several types of phospholipid conjugates of nucleotides<lb/> were synthesized as represented by structure A and B<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). A stearic acid scaffold should provide an opti-<lb/>mal balance between membrane fluidity and sufficient<lb/> permeability <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. A nucleoside moiety consists of either a<lb/> (deoxy)ribofuranose or a xylofuranose linked to thymine<lb/> or adenine; thus creating amphiphiles with large, polar<lb/> head groups.<lb/></p>

			<p>The (? )-α-hydroxy stearic acid 3 is prepared in two<lb/> steps from stearic acid 1 by bromination <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref> using Hell-<lb/>Volhard-Zelinsky condition giving compound 2 followed<lb/> by hydrolysis in 88% overall yield (Scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The (? )-β-<lb/>Hydroxy stearic acid 8 is synthesized by the procedure<lb/> described by Masamune <ref type="biblio">[25,26]</ref>, which involves homolo-<lb/>gation of palmitic acid 5 <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref> using in situ generated<lb/> magnesium monomethylmalonate to a preformed acyl<lb/> imidazole to produce the β-keto stearic acid methyl<lb/> ester, which is reduced <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref> with sodium borohydride in<lb/> ethanol providing 7. Saponification with 1 N NaOH<lb/> resulted in the formation of (? )-β-hydroxy stearic acid 8<lb/> in 77% overall yield (Scheme <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The benzyl esters of α-hydroxy stearate 4 was synthe-<lb/>sized <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref> by heating α-hydroxystearic acid 3, with ben-<lb/>zyl bromide in presence of triethylamine, and catalytic<lb/> amount of TBAI in toluene for 12 h in a yield of 56%.<lb/> The benzyl ester of β-hydroxy stearate 9 is prepared in a<lb/> similar way.<lb/></p>

			<p>The phosphoramidite approach is used for the synthesis<lb/> of the lipid-nucleotide conjugates. The phosphoramidites of<lb/> (? )-α-12 and (? )-β-hydroxy benzyl stearate 13 (Scheme <ref type="figure">4</ref>)<lb/> were prepared by reaction of 4 and 9, respectively, with the<lb/> phosphoramidite reagent 11 (Scheme <ref type="figure">4</ref>), which was ob-<lb/>tained by reaction of bis(diisopropylamino)chlorophosphine<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref> 10 with benzyl alcohol.<lb/></p>

			<p>The protected 2′-deoxyadenosine 14 and adenosine<lb/> 16 were prepared in a similar manner as previously de-<lb/>scribed <ref type="biblio">[31,32]</ref>. Likewise, protected thymidine 15 was<lb/> prepared according to a previously reported procedure<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[31,32]</ref> (Scheme <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The 2′, 3′-O-protected xylofuranose derivative 27 with<lb/> an adenine base moiety (Scheme <ref type="figure">6</ref>) was prepared, starting<lb/> from commercially available diacetone-D-glucose 17.<lb/> Benzoylation of 17 was carried out using sodium hy-<lb/>dride and benzyl bromide in dry dimethylformamide.<lb/></p>

			<p>Selective hydrolysis of the terminal isopropylidene group<lb/> followed by oxidation with sodium periodate, and boro-<lb/>hydride reduction, afforded the 1,2-acetonide 20, in 88%<lb/> yield over three steps. After benzoylation of 20 <ref type="biblio">[33,34]<lb/></ref> and treatment of 21 with Ac 2 O/H 2 SO 4 , a mixture of the<lb/> anomers of 1,2-di-O-acetyl-3-O-benzyl-5-O-benzoyl-D-<lb/>xylofuranose 22 was obtained. Condensation of 22 with<lb/> N 6 -benzoyladenine <ref type="biblio">[35,36]</ref>, provided the desired β-anomer<lb/> 23 in 86% yield.<lb/></p>

			<p>Deprotection of 23 was carried out by using saturated<lb/> methanolic ammonia to give the nucleoside 24 in 68%<lb/> yield. The selective silylation of the 5′-hydroxyl group of<lb/> compound 24 was carried out with TBDMSCl, imidazole<lb/> in dry DMF to obtain nucleoside 25. The 2′-hydroxyl<lb/> group of compound 25 was protected with a carbobenzy-<lb/>loxy group. Finally, the 5′-O-TBDMS group is removed<lb/> with 1 M TBAF in dry THF to obtain compound 27.<lb/></p>

			<p>The synthesis of the phosphotriesters was accomplished<lb/> in a one-pot method by reacting 12 and 13 with the pro-<lb/>tected nucleosides 14, 15, 16 and 27 in the presence of<lb/> 1H-tetrazole followed by oxidation with hydrogen perox-<lb/>ide at -78? C, resulting in the phosphotriesters 29, 32, 35,<lb/> 38, 41, 44, 46, and 48 (Scheme <ref type="figure">7</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>hydrogenolysis in the presence of Pd/C in THF/MeOH.<lb/> Hydrogenolysis in THF/H 2 O as solvent in the presence of<lb/> K 2 CO 3 , was carried out for the deprotection of the phos-<lb/>photriesters of the adenine derivatives (29, 35, 38, 44, 46,<lb/> and 48) to obtain phosphodiesters 30, 36, 39, 45, 47, 49.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>α-(? )-Aminostearic acid 50 was synthesized based on<lb/> the method reported by Toth <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref> and Porter <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>, starting<lb/> from 1-bromohexadecane and diethylacetamido malonate.<lb/> The crude material was directly used for esterification to<lb/> obtain compound 50 (Schemes <ref type="figure">8 and 9</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The synthetic protocol, used for the synthesis of the<lb/> phosphoramidates of dAMP 51 and dTMP 53 was based<lb/> on literature prescription <ref type="biblio">[39,40]</ref> using dicyclohexylcar-<lb/>bodiimide (DCC) as coupling agent for the conjugation<lb/> of nucleotides and amino acid. The phosphoramidates<lb/> 51, 53 were obtained by refluxing the nucleoside mono-<lb/>phosphates and the amino acid methyl ester in t-BuOH<lb/> and water (5:1) in the presence of DCC (dicyclohexyldi-<lb/>carbodiimide). Deprotection of methyl ester was per-<lb/>formed using 0.5 N NaOH in MeOH/H 2 O-5:1 at room<lb/> temperature for 4 h result in the phosphoramidates 52<lb/> and 54.<lb/></p>

			<p>The self-assembling properties of these nucleolipids<lb/> were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy using water<lb/> soluble, and organic soluble (chloroform) fluorescent<lb/> dyes 55 and 56 respectively (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Synthesis of the<lb/> new, water-soluble BODIPY dye 55 was carried out by<lb/> conjugating 8-S-Methyl BODIPY <ref type="biblio">[41]</ref> with taurine in<lb/> presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate in DMSO:DCM<lb/> (1:1) at room temperature. BODIPY 56 was prepared ac-<lb/>cording to the procedure previously reported by Dehaen<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[42,43]</ref> at rt.<lb/></p>

			<p>The nucleolipids, which have been analyzed, consist of<lb/> an α-hydroxy fatty acid (30, 33, 36, 47), a β-hydroxy<lb/> fatty acid (39, 42, 45, 49) or a α-amino fatty acid (52, 54).<lb/> The polar head group is a nucleoside monophosphate<lb/> (dAMP or dTMP) connected to the lipid by a phospho-<lb/>diester (30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 47, 49) or by a phosphora-<lb/>midate bond (52, 54). The sugar is either a deoxyribose<lb/> (30, 33, 39, 42, 52, 54), or a ribofuranose (36, 45) or a<lb/></p>

			<p>xylofuranose (47, 49). The reason for this selection is that<lb/> we would like to evaluate a) if the sugar moiety may influ-<lb/>ence the self-aggregation process, b) if oligomerization<lb/> may lead to DNA and/or RNA sequences, c) if it would<lb/> be possible to form 3′-O, 5′-O-cyclic phosphates in so-<lb/>lution, d) if the properties of the leaving group may<lb/> influence oligomerization or cyclic phosphate formation.<lb/> For example, an α-hydroxy acid may lead to a 5-membered<lb/> intermediate and a β-hydroxy acid to a 6-membered inter-<lb/>mediate during activation of the phosphodiester bond<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>). A phosphoramidate may be activated as leav-<lb/>ing group by acidification of the medium. A xylofuranose<lb/></p>

			<p>may lead easier to cyclic nucleoside formation than a ribo-<lb/>furanose. The availability of as well A as T nucleolipids<lb/> would allow us to study mixed vesicles, in which aggrega-<lb/>tion may be influenced by base pairing.<lb/></p>

			<p>For studying the aggregation of the compounds, fol-<lb/>lowing 2′-deoxynucleolipids have been used: 30, 33, 39,<lb/> 42, 52, and 54. The fluorescent Bodipy dyes (55, 56)<lb/> were used to monitor self-assembly of the nucleolipids<lb/> by visualization under fluorescent microscopy using a spin<lb/> coat method on the surface of a microscopic glass plate.<lb/> Vesicle formation of nucleolipids in water was facilitated<lb/> by adding small amounts of organic solvents to solubilize<lb/> respectively the dye (THF) or the nucleolipid (DMSO).<lb/> Soon after dissolving the nucleolipid by vortexing, a struc-<lb/>tural transition towards thermodynamically more stable<lb/> spherical structures is observed. Vesicular aggregations<lb/> are formed ranging from about a few to 10 μm (large vesi-<lb/>cles), depending on the dilution and solvent conditions.<lb/> Also irregular (small and large tubular structures) aggre-<lb/>gates are formed in some cases. A series of representative<lb/> examples (most frequently occurring aggregates) for the<lb/> phospholipids 30, 33, 42, 52, 54 are shown.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows microphotographs of compound 30 in<lb/> H 2 O using dye 55 for visualization. Single vesicles are<lb/> formed (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) as well as several vesicle aggregates in<lb/> which three (Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) or four (Figure <ref type="figure">3c, d</ref>) water com-<lb/>partments are present. This could be intermediate stages<lb/> in vesicle association or vesicle dissociation. Some of them<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">3d</ref>) are similar in morphology to the thread-like<lb/> vesicles <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>, which are formed before division in daughter<lb/> vesicles. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> gives the images of compound 33 using<lb/> dye 56. Here, single, spherical vesicles are formed using<lb/> water-miscible organic solvents (Figure <ref type="figure">4a, b</ref>), in water<lb/> vesicles tend to associate (Figure <ref type="figure">4c, d</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> is representative for the images observed<lb/> using compound 42 and dye 56. As well the vesicles<lb/> (5a, b, c) are observed as rod-like structures (5a, c)<lb/> which may be precursor structures for vesicle forma-<lb/>tion. Finally, the aggregates formed by the phospho-<lb/>ramidate conjugates with an adenine (52) and thymine<lb/> (54) base moiety were visualized using dye 56. The<lb/> pictures of 52 (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> in THF/dioxane) and 54<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">7b</ref>, c in water) shows the start of the forma-<lb/>tion of vesicle colonies <ref type="biblio">[44]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>For studying the potential of the nucleolipids to di<lb/> (poly)merize and/or to form cyclic nucleotides, com-<lb/>pounds with a deoxyribose (30, 33, 39, 42, 52 and 54), a<lb/> ribose (36, 45) or a xylose (47, 49) sugar moiety were<lb/> envisaged. Both basic and acid circumstances were con-<lb/>sidered. Oligomerization could occur by an intermo-<lb/>lecular reaction in which the 2′-OH or 3′-OH group of<lb/> the sugar moiety attacks the 5′-O-phosphoester func-<lb/>tion, using the hydroxy (amino) lipid as leaving group.<lb/> The carboxylate group in the α-or β-position may<lb/> catalyze this reaction. Alternatively, a 3′-O, 5′-O-cyclic<lb/> nucleotide may be formed (by intramolecular reaction)<lb/> which could oligomerize in solution. During the synthe-<lb/>sis of the compounds, we already observed that some of<lb/> them are not stable in acidic medium. Therefore, all<lb/> compounds were treated in acid and in base medium<lb/> (pH4 and pH12) for a period of 48 h. However in none<lb/> of the cases, polymerization products were detected using<lb/> NMR spectroscopy. These negative results could be ex-<lb/>plained by the high chemical stability of the nucleolipids<lb/> (only starting material present) or by hydrolysis of the<lb/> compounds in acidic and/or basic medium. Therefore, we<lb/> have evaluated this stability for representative examples<lb/> (30, 33, 52, 54).<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>31 P  NMR was used to study the stability of the nucleo-<lb/>lipids in acidic (pH4) and in base (pH12) environment.<lb/> One-dimensional 31 P spectra were used as a fast screening<lb/> experiment to monitor degradation of the conjugates.<lb/> Two-dimensional 1 H-31 P correlation spectra were used to<lb/> characterize the 31 P containing products formed by deg-<lb/>radation of the nucleolipids. Correlations were established<lb/> using a heteroTOCSY experiment with a DIPSI spinlock<lb/> of 50 ms, allowing correlations of 31 P  resonances with sev-<lb/>eral 1 H resonances of adjacent spin systems.<lb/></p>

			<p>The β-hydroxystearic acid containing nucleolipids (39,<lb/> 42, 45, 49) are stable in both acidic and basic conditions<lb/> with no difference in the 31 P and 1 H NMR signals over<lb/> time at different pH s. All other compounds are stable in<lb/> basic conditions (pH = 12 in D 2 O) while degradation oc-<lb/>curs in acidic conditions. For phosphate diesters, a gel is<lb/> formed instantly upon lowering pH in water. Although<lb/> (hydro)gelation is an interesting property and promising<lb/> application of nucleolipids, this was not further investi-<lb/>gated <ref type="biblio">[45]</ref>. Due to hampered NMR measurements in<lb/> aqueous conditions, sample degradation in acid medium<lb/> was monitored in DMSO.<lb/></p>

			<p>An example NMR study on an nucleolipid diester with<lb/> α-hydroxy stearic acid is given in Figures <ref type="figure">8 and 9</ref> for<lb/> compound 30. Original 31 P signals appear in 1D 31 P spec-<lb/>tra between 0.1 and 0.0 ppm corresponding to Cα in R<lb/> and S enantiomers in nucleolipid 30. Due to degradation<lb/> in acidic conditions, a new 31 P signal rises slightly down-<lb/>field (0.4 ppm) while the original signals decrease. In a<lb/> 2D-heteroTOCSY the original signals close to 0 ppm<lb/> correlate with protons in the spin systems of the ribose<lb/> ring (5′/5″/4′) as well as the lipid (α, β, γ). The new signal<lb/> at 0.4 ppm only correlates with protons of the lipid (α, β,<lb/> γ), indicating that the covalent bond between lipid and<lb/> phosphorus still exists after degradation. In acidic medium<lb/> (pH4-5), the thymidine congener 33 is degraded in the<lb/> same way as the adenine congener 30, which shows that<lb/> the cleavage mechanism is not dependent on the nucleo-<lb/>base (Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Decomposition of the phosphoramidate 52 was first<lb/> studied in aqueous, acidic conditions (Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>). We ob-<lb/>served decrease of the original 31 P signal (7 ppm) in D 2 O<lb/> while to signals rose at 2 and 1 ppm. The latter were<lb/> assigned to dAMP and inorganic phosphate respectively<lb/> using [ 1 H, 31 P ]-heteroTOCSY. Since the ratio of both new<lb/> signals is constant over time, we suggest that initial cleav-<lb/>age occurs at both amide and ester bonds in the P linkage<lb/> yielding dAMP and dA respectively. While dAMP is stable<lb/> in the reaction medium, the phosphorylated lipid rapidly<lb/> undergoes hydrolysis releasing inorganic phosphate. In<lb/> DMSO, stability of the phosphorylated lipid is increased,<lb/> making it observable as an intermediate in 1D and 2D<lb/> NMR spectra ( 31 P signal at 8.8 ppm). The H8 signals from<lb/> the nucleobases in 52, dAMP and dA are nicely resolved<lb/> and allowed to determine a ratio of 1/4 for dAMP and dA<lb/> formation:20% of adenosine monophosphate and lipid are<lb/> formed via pathway A and 80% of deoxyadenosine, inor-<lb/>ganic phosphate and lipid are formed in pathway B. The<lb/> thymine containing congener of 52 (54) also follows both<lb/> degradation pathways in acidic conditions: 53% pathway A<lb/> with formation of dTMP and lipid and 47% pathway B<lb/> with formation of thymidine, inorganic phosphate and the<lb/> lipid. Indicating that the nucleobase influences the ratio<lb/> between P-O and P-N bond cleavage.<lb/></p>

			<p>To summarize, among all investigated systems, only<lb/> α-amino compounds have shown the desired, however<lb/> nucleobase dependent, bond breakage upon acidifying;<lb/> the only problem being that the nucleophile is water and<lb/> not the 2 -or 3 -hydroxyl groups. The β-hydroxystearic<lb/> acid containing nucleolipids are stable in both acidic and<lb/> basic conditions. This difference between α and β deriva-<lb/>tives is analogues to previous calculations (done on a<lb/> model in which the nucleoside had been replaced by a me-<lb/>thyl group), showing that the formation of a six-membered<lb/> intermediate by the attack of the β-carboxyl group is<lb/> higher in energy (5 kcalmol-1) than the five-membered<lb/> ring formed by an α-carboxyl group <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. The proposed<lb/> mechanism, predicting acidic instability, in Scheme <ref type="figure">1b</ref> is<lb/> supported by the fact that only amino derivatives cleaved<lb/> at the desired bond, due to the preferred protonation of a<lb/> phosphoramidate over a phosphodiester.<lb/></p>

One-dimensional 31 P spectra were used as a fast<lb/> screening experiment to monitor degradation of the<lb/> conjugates. Two-dimensional 1 H-31 P correlation spectra<lb/> were used to characterize the 31 P containing products<lb/> formed by degradation of the nucleolipids. Correlations<lb/> were established using a Proton-detected hetero-TOCSY<lb/> experiment <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref> with a DIPSI spinlock of 50 ms, allowing<lb/> correlations of 31 P resonances with several 1 H resonances<lb/> of adjacent spin systems.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>We have synthesized a series of amphiphiles in which<lb/> the polar group consists of an adenine or thymine nu-<lb/>cleotide and the lipid moiety is based on stearic acid.<lb/> The nucleolipids are constructed from a phosphodiester<lb/> or phosphoramidate bond formed between α-or β-<lb/>hydroxyl group or the α-amino group present on the lipid<lb/> moiety and the 5′-phosphate group of the nucleotide.<lb/> These molecules have been analyzed for their potential to<lb/> form vesicles in water. This can be considered as a model<lb/> of a protocell with a shell containing covalently bond<lb/> nucleotides, which may be used to establish an informa-<lb/>tion system in the vesicle by polymerization. The func-<lb/>tionalized lipid may function as leaving group for the<lb/> polymerization reaction and the α (or β) carboxylic acid<lb/> may catalyze phosphodiester cleavage.<lb/></p>

			<p>The nucleolipids with a deoxyribose sugar moiety may<lb/> form small or large vesicles, rod-like structures or vesicle<lb/> aggregates. Some of these aggregates can be considered<lb/> as intermediate forms in vesicle formation or division. It<lb/> seems that a diversity of communication systems, by diffu-<lb/>sion (in/out the vesicle) or exchange of material between<lb/> vesicles (via vesicle fusion), between such vesicles exist.<lb/> Suggesting that a protocell could stay out of equilibrium<lb/> by diverse forms of material exchange.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, we could not observe nucleotide polymer-<lb/>ization or cyclic nucleotide formation of these nucleoli-<lb/>pids, regardless of the sugar moiety that is investigated<lb/> (deoxyribose, ribose, xylose). To unravel this observa-<lb/>tion, the chemical stability of the constructs was stud-<lb/>ied. While the nucleolipids containing β-hydroxy fatty<lb/> acids are stable as well in base as in acid circumstances,<lb/> others degraded in acidic conditions. Phosphoramidate<lb/> nucleolipids hydrolyzed by P-N as well as P-O bond<lb/> cleavage where the ratio between both pathways de-<lb/>pends on the nucleobase. Diester constructs with a α-<lb/>hydroxy stearic acid degraded exclusively by hydrolysis of<lb/> the phosphorus to 5′-O-nucleoside ester. To summarize,<lb/> among all investigated systems, only α-amino compounds<lb/> have shown the desired bond breakage, the only problem<lb/> being that the nucleophile is water and not the 2 -or 3 -<lb/>hydroxyl groups. Favoring the intramolecular mechanism<lb/> in order to promote polymerization, acyclic sugar moieties<lb/> such as in GNA could be considered. Also their prebiotic<lb/> relevance makes them ideal candidates to explore proto-<lb/>cells capable of simultaneous core and shell replication<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[48]</ref>. As the compounds are too stable and harsh condi-<lb/>tions would destruct the material itself, more reactive spe-<lb/>cies (such as lipid imidazolates of nucleotides) need to be<lb/> synthesized to further analyze the potential polymerization<lb/> process. This research could be based on the original work<lb/> of L. Orgel <ref type="biblio">[49]</ref>, in which he used phosphorimidazolate<lb/> for nucleotide polymerization. Furthermore, quantitative<lb/> investigation is in order to address the interesting (hydro)<lb/> gelating properties of these new phosphodiester nucleoli-<lb/>pids in acidic aqueous environment.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head>

			<p>All reactions were performed in an inert atmosphere<lb/> (argon). Chemicals and solvents were purchased from<lb/> Sigma-Aldrich, TCI Europe, and Alfa Aesar, and were<lb/> used without further purification. Unless otherwise men-<lb/>tioned, each reaction vessel was oven dried prior to use.<lb/> Column chromatography was performed using silica gel<lb/> (63-200 mesh) obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich Com-<lb/>pany. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was<lb/> performed on Merck pre-coated aluminum plates (silica<lb/> gel 60, F 254 ) and visualized under 254-nm UV light. 1 H,<lb/> 31 P and 13 C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker<lb/> 300 MHz and Bruker 500 MHz instrument at ambient<lb/> temperature in CDCl 3 -d3, MeOD-d4, D 2 O and DMSO-<lb/>d6. Chemical shifts are reported as values in parts per<lb/> million (ppm) downfield from internal standard tetra-<lb/>methylsilane (δ = 0.0 ppm) from the residual solvent sig-<lb/>nal. Splitting patterns are designated as follows: s, singlet;<lb/> d, doublet; t, triplet; m, multiplet; dd, doublet of doublet;<lb/> br, broad peak. NMR signal assignment of sugar protons<lb/> and carbons are numbered with a prime. 31 P  NMR chem-<lb/>ical shifts are referenced to an external 85% H 3 PO 4 stand-<lb/>ard (d =0.000 ppm). Mass spectra were performed on a<lb/> Hewlett Packard MALDI-TOF spectrometer. Fluorescent<lb/> microscopy images were recorded by Olympus Fluoview<lb/> FV 1000 spectrometry.</p>
