			<p>Diosgenin is a phytosteroidal sapogenin found in nature in the<lb/> form of glycosides. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> Due to its impressive pharmacological<lb/> profile, <ref type="biblio">2-7</ref> diosgenin is commonly isolated from plants. <ref type="biblio">8-13<lb/></ref> Methods of its synthesis have also been investigated. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> To<lb/> enhance its pharmacological properties, diosgenin is often<lb/> chemically modified. <ref type="biblio">15-20<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>Diosgenyl glycosides constitute a group of intensively<lb/> explored diosgenin derivatives. Much attention is devoted to<lb/> dioscin, a natural diosgenyl trisaccharide, <ref type="biblio">21-26</ref> but other<lb/> glycosides of diosgenin have also been investigated. <ref type="biblio">27-31<lb/></ref> Among them, diosgenyl glucosaminosides are of great interest<lb/> because it was found that diosgenyl 2-amino-2-deoxy-β-D-<lb/>glucopyranoside hydrochloride induces apoptosis and necrosis<lb/> in some leukemic B-cells. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> The amino group in glucosamine<lb/> creates the possibility of chemical modifications, which is why<lb/> diosgenin is often glycosylated with this sugar. <ref type="biblio">33<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>This work presents the application of the Ferrier rearrange-<lb/>ment to the synthesis of 2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides.<lb/> The Ferrier rearrangement, introduced to sugar chemistry in<lb/> 1962, <ref type="biblio">34</ref> is a useful route leading to 2-enopyranoses that hold a<lb/> high synthetic potential, as described in subsequent re-<lb/>views. <ref type="biblio">35-38</ref> The structural diversity of the obtained 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated glycosides and their substrates allowed for a<lb/> thorough discussion of Ferrier rearrangement mechanism and<lb/> provided novel insight into its course and the factors<lb/> influencing it. The obtained saponins have an atypical pyranose<lb/> ring structure and, in most cases, α configuration of the<lb/> anomeric carbon atom, which have not been reported in the<lb/> literature so far. Chemoselective hydrogenation of 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides provided 2,3-dideoxy dio-<lb/>sgenyl glycosides. The cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of<lb/> all synthesized saponins are presented along with a discussion<lb/> on the structure-activity relationships.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<lb/> </head>

			<head>2.1. Synthesis.</head>

			<p>Six O-acetylated glycals, namely, D-glucal<lb/> (1), D-galactal (2), L-rhamnal (3), L-fucal (4), D-xylal (5), and<lb/> L-arabinal (6), were prepared by adopting the procedures<lb/> described in the literature. <ref type="biblio">39</ref> These were then subjected to<lb/> Ferrier rearrangement, where diosgenin acted as a nucleophile<lb/> and subsequently de-O-acetylated (Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Two catalysts,<lb/> boron trifluoride etherate (BF 3 × OEt 2 ) and iron(III) chloride<lb/> (FeCl 3 ), were tested for coupling glycals 1-6 with diosgenin.<lb/> FeCl 3 was found to be more efficient in these reactions. Among<lb/> the tested solvents, the best yields were obtained in a 2:1<lb/> mixture of diethyl ether (Et 2 O) and dichloromethane (DCM).<lb/></p>

			<p>The reactions of glycals with diosgenin, carried out in the<lb/> presence of FeCl 3 , took 5 min for acetylated D-glucal (1), L-<lb/>rhamnal (3), D-xylal (5), and L-arabinal (6). Acetylated D-<lb/>galactal (2) and L-fucal (4) required 15 min to complete the<lb/> reaction. All these reactions were highly stereoselective,<lb/> yielding 2,3-unsaturated glycosides with the α configuration<lb/> solely in the case of 8-10, the highly predominant α<lb/> configuration in the case of 7 (α/β ∼ 10:1), and the clearly<lb/> predominant β configuration in the case of 11 (α/β ∼ 1:3) and<lb/> 12 (α/β ∼ 1:4).<lb/></p>

            <p>To obtain 2,3-dideoxy diosgenyl glycosides (13-18),<lb/> hydrogenation of 7 using palladium on activated charcoal<lb/> under a hydrogen atmosphere was tested first. Unfortunately,<lb/> this procedure led to several compounds, including diosgenin<lb/> hydrogenation products and the products of hydrogenolysis of<lb/> the glycosidic bond. The latter reaction is justified because the<lb/> anomeric carbon in a 2,3-unsaturated glycoside is an allylic<lb/> carbon. It is known that allylic alcohols, <ref type="biblio">40</ref> ethers, and esters <ref type="biblio">41</ref><lb/></p>

			<figure>Scheme 1. Synthesis of 2,3-Unsaturated (7-12) and 2,3-Dideoxy (13-18) Diosgenyl Glycosides along with the Atom<lb/> Numbering System Used in This Paper<lb/></figure>

			<p>tend to undergo hydrogenolysis. A similar unwanted reaction<lb/> was observed for 2,3-unsaturated sugar 1-O-pivalate when<lb/> subjected to transition-metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of a<lb/> double bond. <ref type="biblio">42<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>Next, the azo compound diimide (HN�NH) was selected<lb/> for the transformation of 7-12 glycosides into 13-18.<lb/> Diimide is a reactive species used for hydrogenation of<lb/> multiple bonds and is known to react more efficiently with<lb/> disubstituted rather than with trisubstituted olefins. <ref type="biblio">43</ref> Notably,<lb/> diimide did not cause hydrogenolysis of the C1-OPiv bond in<lb/> 2,3-unsaturated sugar. <ref type="biblio">42</ref> Hydrazine hydrate, oxidized by<lb/> hydrogen peroxide, <ref type="biblio">44</ref> was used for the in situ generation of<lb/> diimide. We found this reagent to be efficient and selective,<lb/> causing hydrogenation of the double bond in the sugar part<lb/> only without disturbing the glycosidic bond or the double<lb/> bond in diosgenin.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.1. Gen-<lb/>eral Considerations.</head>

			<p>Acetylated glycals treated with nucleo-<lb/>philes in the presence of protic acid tend to undergo acid-<lb/>catalyzed electrophilic addition, where protonation of the<lb/> double bond is followed by the attack of the nucleophile at the<lb/> C1 carbon atom, leading to the formation of 2-deoxyglycosides<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref>). <ref type="biblio">35</ref> The same glycals treated with a nucleophile in<lb/> the presence of a Lewis acid undergo a reaction, leading to 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated glycosides. This reaction is named the Ferrier<lb/> rearrangement after its researcher. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> While the Ferrier<lb/> rearrangement can be carried out with the use of protic<lb/> acids, this procedure is often limited in terms of the chemical<lb/> yields due to a competitive addition reaction. Similarly,<lb/> synthesizing 2-deoxyglycosides from glycals in the presence<lb/> of a protic acid can yield the formation of 2,3-unsaturated<lb/> glycosides as byproducts. Unlike a protic acid, a Lewis acid<lb/> cannot initiate electrophilic addition; instead, it cleaves the 3-<lb/>OAc group, leading to the Ferrier rearrangement.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two pathways of the Ferrier rearrangement are considered,<lb/> both involving a two-step process. The first pathway (Scheme<lb/> <ref type="figure">3A</ref>) should be formally classified as a nucleophilic substitution<lb/> reaction of the S N 1′ type. It involves an allylic carbon atom and<lb/> is characterized by the nucleophile attacking a position<lb/> different from where the nucleofuge leaves. <ref type="biblio">45</ref> In the first step<lb/> of this pathway of the Ferrier rearrangement, a Lewis acid<lb/> cleaves the 3-OAc group in the acetylated glycal, leading to the<lb/> formation of a resonance-stabilized allyloxycarbenium ion<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). Cleavage of any other OAc group in the<lb/> acetylated glycal would not result in the formation of such a<lb/> stable cation <ref type="biblio">46</ref> and, therefore, does not occur. In the second<lb/> step of the first pathway, nucleophilic attack occurs in the<lb/> position where the partial positive charge of the formed cation<lb/> is the greatest, namely, on the anomeric carbon atom (C1).<lb/> This regioselectivity leads exclusively to the formation of 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated glycosides. Rare cases of substitution at the C3<lb/> carbon atom occur when using soft nucleophiles, e.g., RSH,<lb/> N 3<lb/> -. <ref type="biblio">47<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>The second considered pathway of the Ferrier rearrange-<lb/>ment (Scheme <ref type="figure">3B</ref>) assumes that the departure of the 3-OAc<lb/> group is anchimerically assisted by the attack of the<lb/> neighboring 4-OAc group. In this case, the mechanism<lb/> involves a combination of two nucleophilic substitutions.<lb/> The first one is an S N 2 substitution where the trans-oriented 4-<lb/>OAc group acts as a nucleophile, pushing out the 3-OAc group<lb/> to form a dioxolenium ion. In the second step of this pathway<lb/> of the Ferrier rearrangement, the dioxolenium ion should<lb/> undergo an S N 2′ substitution where the nucleophile attacks the<lb/> less hindered C1 carbon atom. Importantly, anchimeric<lb/> assistance requires the 3-OAc and 4-OAc groups in glycal to<lb/> be antiperiplanarly oriented, which excludes the possibility of<lb/> such assistance in the cases of acetylated galactal, fucal, and<lb/> arabinal.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.2. Influence of the Glycal Structure on the Course of<lb/> the Reaction.</head>

			<p>Regardless of which mechanism of the Ferrier<lb/> rearrangement (Scheme <ref type="figure">3</ref>) is more likely, it is the first stage of<lb/> the reaction that determines its rate. This step involves<lb/></p>

			<p>breaking of the C3-O3 bond and may be influenced by the<lb/> structure of the glycal.<lb/></p>

			<p>The double bond of glycals, positioned between the C1 and<lb/> C2 carbon atoms of the pyranoid ring, forces the half-chair<lb/> conformation (H), where the O5, C1, C2, and C3 atoms lie in<lb/> one plane. The remaining two ring atoms (C4 and C5) are<lb/> located either above (superscript) or below (subscript) this<lb/> plane. This means that glycals remain in the 4 H 5 ⇄ 5 H 4<lb/> conformational equilibrium (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The vinylogous anomeric effect (VAE), independently<lb/> introduced by Curran and Suh <ref type="biblio">48</ref> and Denmark and Dappen, <ref type="biblio">49<lb/></ref> is an important factor influencing the conformational<lb/> equilibrium of acetylated glycals. <ref type="biblio">50,51</ref> Actually, this is an<lb/> anomeric effect extended to the C3 carbon atom via a double<lb/> bond. Thus, VAE favors the pseudoaxial orientation of the<lb/> allylic ester group at the C3 carbon in acetylated glycals, and it<lb/> is rationalized by the n → π → σ* delocalization of electrons<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). Importantly, VAE not only stabilizes a given<lb/> glycal conformation (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) but it also weakens the C3-O3<lb/> bond (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>), facilitating its dissociation and thereby<lb/> promoting the Ferrier rearrangement. <ref type="biblio">52</ref> The ease of under-<lb/>going the Ferrier rearrangement is indeed correlated with the<lb/> population of conformations in which the VAE operates. The<lb/> populations of the respective conformations for glycals (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">1</ref>) were established based on the 1 H NMR spectra for 1 and<lb/> 2 <ref type="biblio">53</ref> and based on the DFT calculations for 3-6. <ref type="biblio">51</ref> Comparing<lb/> the stereoisomers in pairs, glucal (1) with a population of 40%<lb/> of the conformer is one in which VAE operates reacts more<lb/> readily than galactal (2) with a population of 12%. Similarly,<lb/> rhamnal (3) with 34% population reacts faster than fucal (4)<lb/> with a population of 26%. Both xylal (5) and arabinal (6)<lb/> reacted equally easily with our reaction, and both adopt mainly<lb/> the conformation in which VAE operates (93% and 92%,<lb/> respectively).<lb/></p>

			<p>An appropriate glycal structure is undoubtedly necessary to<lb/> enable anchimeric assistance (Scheme <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). Stereodirecting<lb/> participation of the ester neighboring group has a rich history<lb/> concerning the typical glycoside synthesis. <ref type="biblio">54</ref> In the case of the<lb/> Ferrier rearrangement, the occurrence of anchimeric assistance<lb/> is cited to explain why acetylated glucal undergoes reaction<lb/> more readily than the acetylated galactal. <ref type="biblio">55</ref> However, it is<lb/> evident that not all glycals require such assistance from the 4-<lb/>OAc group for effective Ferrier rearrangement. <ref type="biblio">37,56</ref> The Ferrier<lb/> rearrangements presented herein also do not fully confirm the<lb/> involvement of the anchimeric assistance in the course of the<lb/> reaction mechanism. Such anchimeric assistance would be<lb/> expected in the cases of acetylated D-glucal (1), L-rhamnal (3),<lb/> and D-xylal (5), which possess trans-oriented 3-OAc and 4-<lb/>OAc groups (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Indeed, reactions under identical<lb/> conditions proceed more rapidly for 1, 3, and 5 compared to 2<lb/> and 4. However, there was no difference in the reaction time<lb/> between acetylated D-xylal (5) and L-arabinal (6); both were<lb/> completed within 5 min, suggesting that anchimeric assistance<lb/> does not determine these reaction times. This conclusion,<lb/> however, remains uncertain, as we did not examine the kinetics<lb/> of these reactions minute by minute.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.3. Influence of the Intermediate&apos;s Structure on the<lb/> Course of the Reaction. </head>

			<p>Two different intermediates are<lb/> considered in the Ferrier rearrangement (Scheme <ref type="figure">3</ref>): the<lb/> allyloxycarbenium ion and the dioxolenium ion. The<lb/> allyloxycarbenium ion derived from acetylated glucal was<lb/> identified and fully characterized by using a superacid. <ref type="biblio">57</ref> In<lb/> turn, respective dioxolenium ions were identified when both<lb/> acetylated glucal and galactal were subjected to nano-<lb/>electrospray ionization followed by in-source fragmentation<lb/> of sodiated glycal precursor ions. <ref type="biblio">58</ref> Meanwhile, anchimeric<lb/> assistance is impossible in the case of the acetylated galactal,<lb/> where the 3-OAc and 4-OAc groups are cis-oriented.<lb/> Therefore, the interconversion of the allyloxycarbenium ion<lb/> into the dioxolenium ion is the only explanation for the<lb/> formation of the latter in the case of the acetylated galactal.<lb/> This equilibrium state means that the formation of the<lb/> dioxolenium ion is not synonymous with anchimeric<lb/> assistance.<lb/></p>

			<p>To gain knowledge about the stability of the intermediate<lb/> products of the Ferrier rearrangement, both the allyloxycarbe-<lb/>nium ions and the dioxolenium ions derived from glycals 1-5<lb/> were optimized by using DFT methods. Glycal 6 was excluded<lb/> from these calculations because the intermediates formed from<lb/> it are enantiomers of the analogous intermediates formed from<lb/> glycal 5. All possible rotations of the exocyclic substituents in<lb/> both ions and in both the 5 H 4 and 4 H 5 conformations were<lb/> considered in these calculations. The optimized, lowest-energy<lb/> structures of the allyloxycarbenium ions (1′-5′) and the<lb/> dioxolenium ions (1″-5″) along with their relative Gibbs free<lb/> energies are presented in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Cartesian coordinates of the<lb/> optimized structures are given in Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>According to the results of DFT calculations (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>), all<lb/> dioxolenium ions (1″-5″) are more stable than their<lb/> allyloxycarbenium counterparts (1′-5′), the difference being<lb/> 2.04 (1″/1′), 4.57 (2″/2′), 2.61 (3″/3′), 4.31 (4″/4′), and<lb/> 5.31 (5″/5′) kcal/mol. However, the most stable dioxolenium<lb/> ions cannot be formed directly from acetylated galactal (2),<lb/> fucal (4), nor arabinal (6). In these cases, if the dioxolenium<lb/> ion exists in the reaction mixture, it is a product of the<lb/> transformation of the respective allyloxycarbenium ion<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">3</ref>). This process is justified by the greater stability<lb/> of the dioxolenium ion compared to that of the allylox-<lb/>ycarbenium ion. An analogous state of equilibrium was<lb/> postulated between the acyloxonium ion (product of the<lb/> anchimeric assistance) and oxacarbenium ion (product of the<lb/> glycosidic bond dissociation) in the proposed mechanism of<lb/> acid hydrolysis of methyl glucosides. <ref type="biblio">59</ref> The question is whether<lb/> the dioxolenium ion can react with diosgenin. Formally, it<lb/> would be a nucleophilic substitution of the S N 2′ type, which is<lb/> possible in the case of steric hindrance at the allylic C3 carbon<lb/> atom. However, such a reaction requires a strong nucleophile,<lb/> while diosgenin is not one. The S N 1′ mechanism seems more<lb/> likely in this situation. According to this mechanism, in the first<lb/> stage, the C3-O3 bond in the dioxolenium ion dissociates,<lb/> leading to the formation of the allyloxycarbenium ion, which is<lb/> attacked by the nucleophile in the second stage. Thus, the<lb/> presence of the allyloxycarbenium ion seems inevitable and<lb/> necessary for Ferrier rearrangement to occur, although the<lb/> existence of the dioxolenium ion in the reaction mixture<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 3. Lowest-energy structures of the allyloxycarbenium (1′-5′) and the dioxolenium ions (1″-5″) and their relative Gibbs free energies<lb/> [kcal/mol], related to the most stable form within a given group of stereoisomers.<lb/></figure>

			<p>cannot be excluded. On the other hand, dioxolenium ions may<lb/> not form at all in the case of acetylated galactal (2), fucal (4),<lb/> and arabinal (6) if it is assumed that the rate constant of<lb/> glycoside formation is higher than the rate constant of the<lb/> allyloxycarbenium ion transformation into the dioxolenium ion<lb/> (k 4 &gt; k 3 ).<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2.4. Influence of the Product&apos;s Structure on the Course<lb/> of the Reaction.</head>

			<p>The attack of the nucleophile on the C1<lb/> carbon atom in the intermediate product of the Ferrier<lb/> rearrangement led to the formation of the α anomer and/or<lb/> the β anomer of the 2,3-unsaturated glycoside (Scheme <ref type="figure">4</ref>). As<lb/> shown below, the ratio of the two anomers formed is closely<lb/> correlated with their conformational stability.<lb/></p>

			<p>The double bond in the Ferrier rearrangement products<lb/> causes the C1, C2, C3, and C4 carbon atoms to lie in one<lb/> plane. Therefore, 2,3-unsaturated glycosides adopt the 0 H 5 or<lb/> 5<lb/> H 0 half-chair conformation (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The conformational<lb/> stability of such a sugar ring depends on three factors. First, to<lb/> avoid unfavorable 1,3 pseudodiaxial interactions, the molecule<lb/> tends to favor the equatorial orientation of the terminal group<lb/> (red in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Second, due to the anomeric effect (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">2C</ref>), a molecule tends to favor the pseudoaxial orientation of<lb/> the aglycone (green in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Third, according to the allylic<lb/> effect, introduced and named by Ferrier and Sankey, <ref type="biblio">60</ref> the<lb/> allylic ester group in 2,3-unsaturated pyranoses favors the<lb/> pseudoaxial orientation (Figure <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). As proved below, not<lb/> only the allylic ester group but also the allylic hydroxyl group<lb/> prefers the pseudoaxial orientation (blue in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>).<lb/> Probably, the allylic effect also applies to the pseudoaxial<lb/> orientation of the aglycone and overlaps with the anomeric<lb/> effect (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>All favorable factors mentioned above are found in the 0 H 5<lb/> conformation identified for 8α and in the 5 H 0 conformation<lb/> identified for 10α (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). These 2,3-unsaturated glycosides<lb/> were formed by the reactions of per-O-acetyl-D-galactal (2)<lb/> and per-O-acetyl-D-fucal (4), respectively. The accumulation of<lb/> favorable factors makes the α glycosides 8α and 10α<lb/> particularly stable and causes the equilibrium of the<lb/> anomerization (Scheme <ref type="figure">4</ref>) to be clearly shifted toward them.<lb/> It is worth noting that galactal (2) and fucal (4) react more<lb/> slowly than other glycals (kinetic aspect), but reactions<lb/></p>

			<figure>Scheme 4. Equilibrium of the Anomerization in the Ferrier Rearrangement<lb/> </figure>

			<figure>Figure 4. Conformations adopted by 7-12 and their characteristic coupling constants. Factors stabilizing conformation: the equatorial orientation<lb/> of the terminal group (red), the anomeric effect (green), and the allylic effect (blue). The slash &quot;/&quot; separates two recorded values for the same<lb/> coupling constant (the digital resolution of the 1 H NMR spectra is 0.305 Hz/point). Subscripts &quot;ax&quot; and &quot;eq&quot; mean axial and equatorial protons,<lb/> respectively.<lb/></figure>

			<p>involving them are highly stereoselective and lead to the<lb/> thermodynamically most stable products.<lb/></p>

			<p>It appears that the equatorial orientation of the terminal<lb/> group and the pseudoaxial orientation of the aglycone are<lb/> enough to make the half-chair conformation stable. This<lb/> statement concerns the 0 H 5 conformation identified for 7α and<lb/> the 5 H 0 conformation identified for 9α. Due to this<lb/> conformational stability, the equilibrium between the formed<lb/> anomers in the reaction of glucal (1) and rhamnal (3) with<lb/> diosgenin is again shifted toward the α anomer (7α and 9α),<lb/> but not as strongly as in the case of galactal (2) and fucal (4).<lb/> Small amounts of 7β are also obtained in the reaction of glucal<lb/> (1) with diosgenin. This anomer, however, is not thermody-<lb/>namically favored because it is conformationally unstable. In<lb/> the 0 H 5 conformation of 7β, the terminal group is oriented<lb/> favorably, but the aglycone and 4-OH groups are oriented<lb/> unfavorably. It is exactly the opposite in the 5 H 0 conformation<lb/> of 7β. None of the half-chair conformations of 7β are stable<lb/> enough to be fully adopted. Therefore, 7β remains in the 0 H 5<lb/> ⇄ 5 H 0 conformational equilibrium, which was proven based<lb/> on its 1 H NMR spectrum (see Section 2.3). The fact that 7β is<lb/> in conformational equilibrium indicates that the equatorial<lb/> orientation of the terminal hydroxymethyl group is the most<lb/> important factor in determining the conformational preference<lb/> of 2,3-unsaturated glycosides. This effect in the 0 H 5<lb/> conformation of 7β is offset by both the anomeric effect and<lb/> the allylic effect in the 5 H 0 conformation of 7β. The lack of this<lb/> important factor in 11 and 12 completely changes the<lb/> anomeric preferences in the Ferrier rearrangement in the<lb/> case of acetylated xylal (5) and arabinal (6). The products of<lb/> their reactions are dominated by β anomers, which can adopt a<lb/> conformation where the other two favorable effects occur. This<lb/> is the 5 H 0 conformation in the case of 11β and the 0 H 5<lb/> conformation in the case of 12β (it should be added that the<lb/> sugar parts of 11β and 12β are mirror images). The α<lb/> configuration of 2,3-unsaturated glycosides 11α and 12α,<lb/> unlike the β configuration of 11β and 12β, does not allow for<lb/> the aglycone and 3-OH groups to be pseudoaxially oriented at<lb/> the same time. As a result, the α anomers are thermodynami-<lb/>cally less stable than the β anomers, which shifts the<lb/> anomerization equilibrium in favor of the latter. The fact<lb/> that α anomers adopt a conformation in which the aglycone is<lb/> pseudoaxially oriented may mean that the anomeric effect is<lb/> stronger than the allylic effect caused by the 3-OH group. It is<lb/> also possible that both the anomeric and allylic effects act in<lb/> the pseudoaxial arrangement of the aglycone. On the other<lb/> hand, the fact that the β anomers (11β and 12β) dominate<lb/> over the α anomers (11α and 12α) in the products of reaction<lb/> of xylal (5) and arabinal (6) is evidence of the allylic effect<lb/> action caused by the 3-OH group.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3. Identification of the 0 H 5 and 5 H 0 Conformations.<lb/></head>

			<p>The J 4′,5′ coupling constant is the most diagnostic for<lb/> distinguishing between the 5 H 0 and 0 H 5 conformations. If<lb/> the J 4′,5′ is in the range of 8-9 Hz, it means that the H5 proton<lb/> is axially oriented and the H4 proton is pseudoaxially oriented.<lb/> Such a situation takes place in the 0 H 5 conformation of 7α and<lb/> the 5 H 0 conformation of 9α (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The J 3′,4′ ∼ 0 Hz<lb/> recorded for 7α and 9α is an additional confirmation of the<lb/> pseudoaxial orientation of the H4 proton. This value means<lb/> that the H3-C3-C4-H4 torsion angle is close to 90°. In the<lb/> half-chair conformations where the C1, C2, H2, C3, H3, and<lb/> C4 atoms are arranged in one plane, such a value of the torsion<lb/> angle occurs with the pseudoaxial orientation of the H4<lb/> proton. The pseudoequatorial orientation of the H4 proton is<lb/> in accordance with the allylic effect and takes place in the most<lb/> stable conformations, i.e., the 0 H 5 for 8α and the 5 H 0 for 10α.<lb/> In these cases, the J 4′,5′ coupling constants are 2.14 or close to<lb/> zero. These values, in particular J 4′,5′ ∼ 0 Hz, clearly confirm<lb/> the conformation assigned to compounds 8α and 10α because<lb/> these are characteristic of the antiperiplanar orientation of the<lb/> H4 proton and the ring oxygen atom. <ref type="biblio">61</ref> In turn, J 3′,4′ = 5.49 Hz<lb/> is typical for a torsion angle of about 10°. <ref type="biblio">62<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>There is no terminal group on the C5 carbon atom in<lb/> pentopyranoses; thus, two different J 4′,5′ coupling constants are<lb/> recorded for them. The larger constant is for the axial H5<lb/> proton, and the smaller one is for the equatorial H5 proton. If<lb/> one of these constants is 7.93 Hz and the other is 5.49, then<lb/> the H4 proton is pseudoaxially oriented. This situation occurs<lb/> in the 0 H 5 conformation of 11α and the 5 H 0 conformation of<lb/> 12α. If one of these constants is 2.75 Hz and the other is 1.22<lb/> Hz, then the H4 proton is pseudoequatorially oriented. This<lb/> situation takes place in the 5 H 0 conformation of 11β and the<lb/> 0 H 5 conformation of 12β. The coupling constant J 3′,4′ = 5.19<lb/> Hz additionally confirms the pseudoequatorial orientation of<lb/> the H4 proton in 11β and 12β.<lb/></p>

			<p>The coupling constants recorded for 7β, particularly J 3′,4′ =<lb/> 3.05/3.35 Hz and J 4′,5′ = 3.96 or 5.50 Hz, indicate the<lb/> conformational equilibrium of the 2,3-unsaturated sugar ring.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4. Cytotoxic Activity.</head>

			<p>The MTT assay was performed to<lb/> specify the cytotoxicity of 7-12 and 13-18 against prostate<lb/> cancer cells (PC3 line), breast cancer cells (MCF7 line), and<lb/> human keratinocytes (HaCaT line). The mentioned cell lines<lb/> were assayed by exposing them for 48 h to a medium<lb/> containing the studied compounds over a wide range of<lb/> concentrations. The viabilities of PC3 (A), MCF7 (B), and<lb/> HaCaT (C) cells with the tested compounds are presented in<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">S16</ref>. The IC 50 values (dose of the compound which<lb/> caused a 50% reduction of cell viability) and the selectivity<lb/> indexes (SI), which show the ratio of IC 50 for normal cell line<lb/> to IC 50 for cancer cell line, are shown in Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The majority of the presented saponins, both 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated (7-12) and 2,3-dideoxy (13-18), are effectively<lb/> active against PC3 cancer cells at concentrations above 18-19<lb/> μM (Figure <ref type="figure">S16</ref>). The effective action of these saponins on<lb/> MCF7 cancer cells requires rather high concentrations. The<lb/> 2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycoside with the α-D-erythro<lb/> configuration (7α), which is derived from D-glucal (1) and<lb/> adopts the 0 H 5 conformation, is the most active saponin<lb/> against PC3 cancer cells. The respective IC 50 value for 7α is<lb/> 16.84 μM (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). This means that 7α exhibits larger<lb/> cytotoxicity against PC3 cancer cells than diosgenyl β-D-<lb/>glucopyranoside (7β) and diosgenin alone, both tested on<lb/> cervical HeLa and CaSki cancer cells. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> Importantly, saponin<lb/> 7α has a slightly stronger effect on PC3 cancer cells than on<lb/> the healthy cells tested (SI = 1.20).<lb/></p>

			<p>Among the 2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides, saponin<lb/> 12β with β-L-glycero configuration and the 0 H 5 conformation<lb/> exhibits the best selectivity (SI 2.08). It has relatively good<lb/> activity against PC3 cells (IC 50 = 27.85 μM). The selectivity of<lb/> 12β is twice as high as the selectivity of 8α. The latter saponin<lb/> differs from the former only in the presence of a terminal<lb/> hydroxymethyl group. It seems that the lack of a terminal<lb/> hydroxymethyl group is a good predictor of the selectivity of<lb/> the anticancer effect of saponins. Those that have a favorable<lb/> SI value (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) for both cancer cell lines (ca. 2) have<lb/> hydrogen (12β, 18β) or methyl (15α) in place of the CH 2 OH<lb/> group.<lb/></p>

			<p>The configuration of the anomeric carbon atom of 2,3-<lb/>unsaturated saponin 11 influences its anticancer activity. While<lb/> the α anomer (11α) exhibits activity against the PC3, MCF7,<lb/> and HaCaT cell lines at the IC 50 level of 24.44, 40.59, and<lb/> 24.48 μM, respectively, the β anomer (11β) is completely<lb/> inactive in the case of all tested cell lines. This completely<lb/> inactive saponin 11β is a diastereoisomer of saponin 12β,<lb/> which is active against the tested cell lines at the IC 50 level of<lb/> 27.85, 35.61, and 57.87 μM, respectively. In diastereoisomers<lb/> 11β and 12β, the sugar parts are mirror images. This means<lb/> that the absolute configuration (D or L) of the sugar part is<lb/> relevant to the saponin activity. This situation changes when<lb/> we consider the analogous anomers of diosgenyl 2,3-dideoxy<lb/> glycosides (17). In their case, the β anomer (17β) is definitely<lb/> more active against all tested cell lines than the α anomer<lb/> (17α). In turn, the pair of diastereoisomers 17β and 18β, in<lb/> which the sugar parts are mirror images, do not differ<lb/> significantly in activity toward the tested cancer cell lines. The<lb/> presented results indicate that the presence or absence of a<lb/> double bond, which, among other things, determines the shape<lb/> of the pyranose ring, half-chair in the case of 11, and chair in<lb/> the case of 17, has a significant impact on the activity of the<lb/> tested compounds.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.5. Hemolytic Activity.</head>

			<p>Regardless of numerous<lb/> pharmacological properties, saponins are known to induce<lb/> hemolysis, which limits their potential. <ref type="biblio">63</ref> Therefore, the<lb/> hemolytic activities of compounds 7-12 and 13-18 were<lb/> determined. The results revealed that the tested compounds<lb/> have no hemolytic activity. The level of hemolysis for samples<lb/> exposed to the compounds at the highest concentrations was<lb/> not higher than 1% as compared to the positive controls.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.6. Antimicrobial Activity.</head>

			<p>2,3-Unsaturated (7-12) and<lb/> 2,3-dideoxy (13-18) diosgenyl glycosides were tested for their<lb/> in vitro antimicrobial activity against seven strains of Gram-<lb/>positive bacteria and four strains of Gram-negative bacteria.<lb/> The measured minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)<lb/> values for G(+) bacteria are summarized in Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>. The<lb/> MIC values for G(-) bacteria are not presented because these<lb/> are &gt;256 μg/mL in each case, which means a lack of activity at<lb/> the highest tested concentration.<lb/></p>

			<p>Lack of activity against G(-) bacteria is typical for diosgenyl<lb/> glycosides. None of the diosgenyl glycosaminosides previously<lb/> tested by us showed such activity. <ref type="biblio">64-66</ref> However, it is<lb/> surprising that 7-12 and 13-18 show such low activity<lb/> against G(+) bacteria (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). In the best cases, some of<lb/> the 2,3-unsaturated saponins (7-12) are active against some<lb/> of the bacterial strains and cultures used only when the<lb/> compounds are applied at the highest tested concentration<lb/> (256 μg/mL). The same can be said about 2,3-dideoxy<lb/> saponins (13-18), although compounds 14α and 17α are an<lb/> exception here. These inhibit the growth of the Staphylococcus<lb/> aureus strains tested, including methicilin-resistant S. aureus<lb/> (ATCC codes 43,300 and 33,591). The antistaphylococcal<lb/> activity was achieved when 14α and 17α were applied at<lb/> concentrations of 64-256 and 128-256 mg/L, respectively<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). S. aureus is one of the most health-threatening<lb/> bacteria due to its ability to develop resistance to<lb/> antimicrobials and form biofilms on biomaterials. The results<lb/> obtained for compounds 14α and 17α encourage further study<lb/> of their antistaphylococcal activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. SUMMARY<lb/></head>

			<p>This work presents an efficient and stereoselective synthesis of<lb/> 2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycosides mainly with the atypical α<lb/> configuration of the anomeric carbon atom. These saponins<lb/> were subsequently chemoselectively hydrogenated to 2,3-<lb/>dideoxy diosgenyl glycosides.<lb/></p>

			<p>The configurational diversity of the used glycals and<lb/> obtained 2,3-unsaturated glycosides enabled an in-depth<lb/> discussion of the Ferrier rearrangement mechanism. This<lb/> discussion led to the following conclusions: (1) the VAE in<lb/> glycals may have a beneficial impact on the reaction course. (2)<lb/> Although the structure of glucal, rhamnal, and xylal allows for<lb/> anchimeric assistance, the latter is not necessary for the<lb/> formation of the dioxolenium ion. (3) The intermediate<lb/> product of the Ferrier rearrangement represents an equilibrium<lb/> mixture of the dioxolenium ion and allyloxycarbenium ion,<lb/> shifted in favor of the former. (4) It is the allyloxycarbenium<lb/> ion that undergoes the farther reaction with the nucleophile.<lb/> (5) The high stereoselectivity of the Ferrier rearrangement is<lb/> clearly correlated with the conformational stability of the<lb/> products. (6) Factors influencing this stability are ranked as the<lb/> equatorial orientation of the terminal group &gt; pseudoaxial<lb/> orientation of the aglycone &gt; pseudoaxial orientation of the 3-<lb/>OH group.<lb/> </p>

			<p>The new type of saponins presented exhibits moderate<lb/> anticancer activity and almost no antibacterial activity. The<lb/> structure-activity relationship discussion indicates the follow-<lb/>ing: (1) the absence of a terminal hydroxymethyl group in a<lb/> sugar moiety is a good predictor of cytotoxic selectivity. (2)<lb/> The anomeric carbon atom configuration influences anticancer<lb/> activity. (3) Both the configuration and conformation of the<lb/> pyranose ring affect the activity of the tested saponins.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1.1. General Methods.</head>

			<p>Solvents and chemical reagents were<lb/> purchased and used without further purification. The 1 H and 13 C<lb/> NMR spectra were recorded on the Bruker Avance III 500 MHz<lb/> (500.13/125.76 MHz), using CDCl 3 as a solvent with internal Me 4 Si.<lb/> Structural assignments were made with additional information from<lb/> COSY and HSQC experiments. The digital resolution of the 1 H NMR<lb/> spectra was 0.305 Hz/point. Positive-ion mode MALDI-TOF mass<lb/> spectra were obtained using a Bruker Biflex III spectrometer with 4-<lb/>cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrixes.<lb/> High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra were recorded<lb/> using a Nexera X2 ultra high performance liquid chromatographyin-<lb/>strument coupled to a Triple TOF 5600+ (SCIEX) mass<lb/> spectrometer equipped with a duoelectrospray interface, operated in<lb/> the negative ionization mode as the monoisotopic formate adducts.<lb/> Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminum<lb/> plates coated with E. Merck Kieselgel 60 F 254 , using the following<lb/> eluent systems (v/v): A, 2:1 toluene/AcOEt; B, 6:1 toluene/AcOEt;<lb/> C, 9:1 toluene/AcOEt; D, 1:2 toluene/AcOEt; E, 2:1 n-heptane/<lb/> AcOEt; F, 4:1 n-heptane/AcOEt. For the compounds detection, the<lb/> dry plates were sprayed with 1% H 2 SO 4 in MeOH and heated at ca.<lb/> 200 °C in a stream of hot air. Filtration through silica gel was<lb/> performed on MN Kieselgel 60 (&lt;0.08 mm). Column flash<lb/> chromatography was conducted using a PuriFlash 450 instrument<lb/> with a UV-DAD detector on PuriFlash SI-HP 50 μm columns, using<lb/> one of the above-mentioned eluent systems.<lb/></p>

 			<head>4.1.3. 2,3-Unsaturated Diosgenyl Glycosides (7-12).</head>

			<p>General<lb/> procedure: Diosgenin (1.0-1.1 mmol) and the respective per-O-<lb/>acetylated glycal (1-6) (1.0 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of<lb/> anhydrous Et 2 O and DCM (2:1) with the addition of freshly dried,<lb/> ground molecular sieves 4 Å. Next, anhydrous FeCl 3 was added<lb/> (0.05-0.1 mmol). The mixture was stirred at rt for 5-15 min and<lb/> monitored with TLC (eluent A). Then, the reaction mixture was<lb/> filtered through silica gel under reduced pressure using DCM as an<lb/> eluent. Next, the solvents were evaporated, and the residue was<lb/> dissolved in an anhydrous solution of MeONa (0.3-0.5 mmol) in<lb/> MeOH (35 mL). The mixture was stirred at rt for 0.5-3 h, monitored<lb/> with TLC (eluent A), and finally passed through silica gel using<lb/> CHCl 3 as an eluent. The solvents were evaporated, and the residue<lb/> was purified using flash chromatography (eluent B or C).<lb/></p>

			<p>General<lb/> procedure: Respective 2,3-unsaturated diosgenyl glycoside (7-12)<lb/> (0.05-0.10 mmol) was dissolved in a 10% solution of hydrazine<lb/> hydrate in EtOH (10 mL). The mixture was stirred at 50-55<lb/> °C<lb/> under reflux, and 30% water solution of H 2 O 2 (3.5-4.0 mL) was<lb/> added in portions over 2 h. The reaction was continued for next 16-<lb/>22 h and monitored with TLC (eluent A or E). Next, a catalytical<lb/> amount of active charcoal was added to eliminate the excess of H 2 O 2<lb/> and the mixture was stirred for another 1 h. Then, the solution was<lb/> filtered through Celite, diluted with CHCl 3 , and washed three times<lb/> with water.

			<head>4.2. Cytotoxicity Assay.</head>

			<p>An MTT assay was performed to specify<lb/> the cytotoxicity of the studied compounds against breast cancer cells<lb/> (MCF-7 line, ATCC), prostate cancer cells (PC3 line, ATCC) and<lb/> human keratinocytes (HaCaT line, CLS). The MCF-7 cell line was<lb/> cultured in an RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher<lb/> Scientific), the PC3 cell line in a F-12K medium (Gibco, Thermo<lb/> Fisher Scientific), and the HaCaT cell line in a high-glucose DMEM<lb/> (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each medium was supplemented<lb/> with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and<lb/> antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Gibco, Thermo Fisher<lb/> Scientific). Cells were seeded at a density of 4000 per well into 96-<lb/>well plates and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. The cells<lb/> were treated with studied compounds in a concentration range of<lb/> 0.1-100 μg/mL or with a vehicle (1% DMSO) as a control and<lb/> subsequently incubated for 48 h. Thereafter, the MTT salt solution<lb/> (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide,<lb/> VWR) was added at a concentration of 4 mg/mL (25 μL per well),<lb/> and the obtained product (formazan) after 3 h of incubation was<lb/> dissolved in DMSO. An EnSpire microplate reader (PerkinElmer) was<lb/> used to measure absorbance at 570 nm (the reference wavelength was<lb/> 660 nm). The viability of the control cells was taken as 100%. Three<lb/> independent experiments were conducted in triplicate. Statistical<lb/> analysis of the results and estimation of IC 50 values were performed<lb/> using GraphPad Prism 7 software.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3. Hemolysis Assay.</head>

			<p>The hemolytic activity was determined on<lb/> erythrocytes from defibrinated sheep blood (Graso, Poland). The red<lb/> blood cells were suspended in phosphoric buffer (PBS; AppliChem,<lb/> Germany) to a final concentration of 4% and added to a polystyrene<lb/> 96-well plate and exposed to tested compounds (concentration range<lb/> of 256-0.25 mg/L) for 1 h at 37 °C. The compounds were<lb/> suspended in DMSO and serially diluted in PBS (the final<lb/> concentration of DMSO in samples did not exceed 5%; it was<lb/> confirmed that such concentration of DMSO did not cause<lb/> hemolysis). After incubation, the plates were centrifuged (800g, 10<lb/> min, 4 °C) and absorbance of supernatant was measured with a<lb/> microplate spectrophotometer under a wavelength of 590 nm<lb/> (Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO, Thermofisher). Sheep erythrocytes<lb/> exposed to 1% Triton X-100 served as a positive control (100%<lb/> hemolysis), while the suspensions were in PBS.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.4. Determination of Antibacterial Activity.</head>

			<p>MIC was<lb/> determined with the dilution method in Mueller-Hinton II broth<lb/> (MHB II) on 96-well polystyrene plates. The reference strains (Polish<lb/> Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland) of Gram-positive bacteria<lb/> (Enterococcus faecium ATCC 29,212, S. aureus ATCC 6538, S. aureus<lb/> ATCC 43,300, S. aureus ATCC 12,598, S. aureus ATCC 25,923, S.<lb/> aureus, ATCC 33,591, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14,990) and<lb/> Gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter baumanii ATCC 23,506,<lb/> Escherichia coli ATCC 25,922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700,603,<lb/> Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027) were suspended in MHB II<lb/> medium to initial inoculum of 10 5 cfu/mL. The microbes were<lb/> exposed to graded concentrations of tested compounds (range 0.5-<lb/>256 mg/L) for 18 h at 37 °C under aerobic conditions. The<lb/> compounds were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted with PBS. The<lb/> final concentration of DMSO in a sample with microbes did not<lb/> exceed 5% (it was confirmed that this amount of DMSO did not affect<lb/> the microbial growth). MIC was taken as the lowest concentration at<lb/> which no microbial growth was observed. The experiments were<lb/> performed in triplicate.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.5. Methodology of DFT Calculations.</head>

			<p>All the calculated<lb/> structures were built in the MOLDEN program. <ref type="biblio">67</ref> The structures<lb/> were optimized using M06-2X functional <ref type="biblio">68</ref> and Pople&apos;s 6-311+G**<lb/> basis set. The M062X function is recommended to solve a wide<lb/> variety of chemical problems, including the study of conformational<lb/> equilibria. <ref type="biblio">69</ref> It was previously used by us in conformational studies of<lb/> glycals, giving high agreement with the experiment. <ref type="biblio">70</ref> The<lb/> optimizations were considered satisfactory if the standard criteria<lb/> were fulfilled, that is, the energy difference between the optimization<lb/> cycles was lower than 1 × 10 -6 hartree and a gradient of &lt;1 × 10 -4 au<lb/> was achieved. Standard convergence criteria were employed for all<lb/> calculations. The Hessian calculations were performed for any<lb/> geometry optimized to confirm that the stationary points correspond-<lb/>ing to the minimum have been obtained with no negative eigenvalues.<lb/> The Hessian calculations were also used to estimate zero-point<lb/> vibrational effects, molecular entropies, and thermal energy<lb/> contributions according to statistical thermodynamics formulas. The<lb/> relative energy of the ith conformer is the sum of electronic and zero-<lb/>point energy, referring to the energy of the most stable conformer. In<lb/> turn, the relative Gibbs free energy of the ith conformer is the sum of<lb/> its electronic energy and thermal correction to Gibbs free energy,<lb/> referred to as the Gibbs free energy of the most stable conformer. All<lb/> calculations were performed in the gas phase at standard temperature<lb/> and pressure conditions (298.15 K and 1 atm.), using the GAUSSIAN<lb/> 09 package. <ref type="biblio">71</ref></p>
