			<p>Ambergris (&quot;grey amber&quot;) is a coprolite from the sperm whale<lb/> (Physeter macrocephalus) digestive tract, probably arising from gut irri-<lb/>tation by indigestible squid beaks. Its unique scent led to its use as a<lb/> flavoring agent, incense, and as a perfume base since antiquity. It still is<lb/> one of the best fixatives known for perfume production to date. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> How-<lb/>ever, the trade of ambergris jetsam is banned by many countries, <ref type="biblio">2</ref> and a<lb/> shrinking sperm whale population and increasing pollution make<lb/> ambergris extremely rare. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> Therefore, it is typically substituted by syn-<lb/>thetic alternatives.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a component of the ambergris&apos; odorless fraction, ambreinolide (1,<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), contributes to its extraordinary fixative properties. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> It is believed<lb/> to arise from ambreine (2), the main constituent of ambergris, by slow<lb/> autoxidative degradation in the open sea. <ref type="biblio">4</ref> Furthermore, it was found in<lb/> several plants used for medical applications. <ref type="biblio">5-11</ref> Several syntheses<lb/> feature ambreinolide (1) as an intermediate or as a starting materi-<lb/>al. <ref type="biblio">12-20</ref> Its terpene framework is typical for the drimane<lb/> sesquiterpenoids. <ref type="biblio">21<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>Previously reported syntheses of ambreinolide (1) mainly rely on<lb/> transformations of other complex natural products which are not always<lb/> easy to access. <ref type="biblio">12,14,15,22-26</ref> An acid-mediated polyene cyclization of the<lb/> far more simple farnesylacetic acid was reported early on by Stork, but<lb/> gave less than 3% yield of racemic ambreinolide (1). <ref type="biblio">27</ref> A more pro-<lb/>ductive modification of this procedure uses 2-nitropropane as a non-<lb/>benign solvent. <ref type="biblio">15,16</ref> However, in our hands, this procedure was diffi-<lb/>cult to reproduce and generated numerous byproducts which were<lb/> difficult to separate, resulting in low overall yields.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to develop a novel, scalable total synthesis of ambreinolide<lb/> (1) from a polyene precursor, its structure was retrosynthetically<lb/> simplified to enone 3 (Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>), which may be accessed from phenolic<lb/> derivatives 4 by reductive dearomatization. This terpenoid could rapidly<lb/> arise from suitably protected dienes 5 by a proton-initiated, diaster-<lb/>eoselective polycyclization reaction that is terminated by the electron-<lb/>rich arene nucleus. Diene 5 was planned to be synthesized from easily<lb/> available geranyl acetate (6) and a benzylic Grignard (7). Key to this<lb/> plan was the development of a scalable polyene cyclization. <ref type="biblio">28<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>Aiming to investigate and develop such a synthesis, the phenolic<lb/> polyene 9 was prepared from geranyl acetate (6) by employing S N 2-<lb/>selective substitution with a cuprate derived from Grignard reagent 7<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref>). <ref type="biblio">29</ref> Subsequent demethylation of anisole 5a afforded the<lb/> phenol 5b in very good yields.<lb/></p>

			<p>After unsuccessful attempts to promote polyene cyclizations of this<lb/> precursor with simple reagents, we turned our attention to Yamamoto&apos;s<lb/> Lewis-acid assisted chiral Brønsted acids (LBAs) <ref type="biblio">30</ref> and related reagents<lb/> for stereoselective protonation. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> These reagents are formed by coordi-<lb/>nation of a Lewis acid to a weak Brønsted acid, in order to increase its<lb/> acidity, and to confine the putative protonation vector. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> Enantiose-<lb/>lective polyene cyclizations with LBAs of type 8, formed from chiral<lb/> BINOL derivatives with tin tetrachloride in situ, have been reported. <ref type="biblio">28<lb/></ref> Owing to the preferred protonation of the terminal alkene, comparable<lb/> to terpene cyclases, this method is considered biomimetic. <ref type="biblio">33-37<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>We employed monobenzylated S-BINOL 10 as the Brønsted acid for<lb/> studying the intended polyene cyclization and investigated different<lb/> protecting groups for phenol 5b (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, entries 1-7) for achieving the<lb/> desired regioselectivity and for obtaining proper reactivity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Weakly electron-poor acylated phenols were found promising with<lb/> respect to regio-and diastereoselectivity (entries 1-3). In these cases,<lb/> additional exposure to BF 3 •OEt 2 was required to complete bicyclization<lb/> to tricycles 4c-f from mixtures with monocyclized alkenes 9. Never-<lb/>theless, the products were isolated as the desired single diastereo-and<lb/> regioisomers in very good yields. The pivaloyl protection provided best<lb/> yield and enantioselectivity (entry 3). Introduction of a phenyl-<lb/>carbamate group instead led to reduced enantiomeric excess (entry 4).<lb/> Less electron-withdrawing protecting groups like dimethylcarbamate<lb/> and TBDPS (entries 5-6) resulted in inseparable product mixtures. The<lb/> strongly electron-withdrawing triflate disabled the second cyclization<lb/> step (entry 7).<lb/></p>

			<p>Although the pivaloyl-protected phenol 5e was most productive, we<lb/> observed only moderate enantioselectivity (62% e.e.). Therefore, a se-<lb/>ries of different BINOL derivatives 11-21 were tested as alternative<lb/> reagents. Unfortunately, all modifications led to decreased enantiose-<lb/>lectivity or discouraging of activity (entries 8-18). Changing the<lb/> solvent or employing less active LBAs at higher temperature remained<lb/> unsuccessful. The application of an antimony pentachloride based LBA <ref type="biblio">38<lb/></ref> resulted in fully racemic product in this case (data not shown).<lb/></p>

			<p>A mechanistic rationale delineated from Yamamoto&apos;s studies on<lb/> LBA-induced asymmetric polyene cyclization is depicted in Scheme <ref type="figure">3</ref>.<lb/> LBA complexes 8 likely chelate SnCl 4 in an equatorial-equatorial<lb/> fashion. The only moderately face selective protonation traverses pu-<lb/>tative transition state I in which steric repulsion between the BINOL<lb/> moiety and the polyene substrate is minimized, and the n-π* interaction<lb/> between an oxygen lone pair and the terminal double bond is facili-<lb/>tated. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> Initial protonation could lead to a concerted transition state II<lb/> that produces decaline 4e directly by bicyclization. Alternatively, the<lb/> polyene cyclization may proceed stepwise by involving the aryl-shielded<lb/> intermediate III. This would give first the alkene isomers 9. After a<lb/> second protonation carbocationic intermediate IV would transform to<lb/> decaline 4e with high trans-selectivity. <ref type="biblio">35</ref> The stepwise mechanism may<lb/> be predominant considering the initial formation of alkenes 9 in large<lb/> amounts (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), with some bicyclization occurring in this application.<lb/></p>

			<p>To our delight, we found the simple LBA (±)-BINOL⋅SnCl 4 used in a<lb/> sub-stochiometric amount to preserve full regio-and diastereoselectivity,<lb/> and to give high yields for the desired bicyclization (Scheme <ref type="figure">4</ref>) after<lb/> addition of BF 3 •OEt 2 . Unfortunately, lowering the amount of catalyst or<lb/> using BF 3 •OEt 2 or SnCl 4 alone produced product mixtures. Further<lb/> optimization led to a one-pot procedure without the necessity to isolate<lb/> intermediates, while BINOL can easily be recovered and reused. <ref type="biblio">38<lb/></ref> Removal of the pivaloyl protecting group from bicyclization product 4e<lb/> provided highly crystalline phenol 4b in very good yield on decagram<lb/> scale (Scheme <ref type="figure">4</ref>). X-ray single-crystal structure analysis confirmed the<lb/> desired trans configuration.<lb/></p>

			<p>Methylation of phenol 4b gave anisole 4a quantitatively (Scheme <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/> Birch reduction and acidic hydrolysis of the resulting enol ether afforded<lb/> enone 3 selectively in very good yield.<lb/></p>

			<p>Treatment of enone 3 with mCPBA induced Baeyer-Villiger oxidation<lb/> and subsequent enol epoxidation, <ref type="biblio">24</ref> to cleanly yield epoxy lactone 22<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Wolff-Kishner-type conditions led to base-induced rear-<lb/>rangement and formation of intermediate hydrazone 23, which con-<lb/>verted to acid 24 with heating. <ref type="biblio">24,39</ref> Upon exposure to sulfuric acid in<lb/> acetic acid, carboxylic acid 24 underwent a cationic cyclization to<lb/> selectively give ambreinolide (±)-1 in an overall yield of 65% from<lb/> enone 3. X-ray single-crystal structure analysis confirmed the desired<lb/> structure of the obtained product (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). We synthesized 7.7 g of<lb/> ambreinolide (±)-1 in a single lab batch, demonstrating the scalability<lb/> and robustness of this total synthesis route.<lb/></p>

			<p>In summary, we have developed a novel total synthesis of racemic<lb/> ambreinolide, providing convenient access to (±)-1 on multigram-scale.<lb/> This material is not only highly valuable per se, but also an attractive<lb/> starting material for the synthesis of structurally related natural prod-<lb/>ucts. Key was the development of a regio-and diastereoselective, high-<lb/>yielding polyene cyclization induced by the LBA (±)-BINOL⋅SnCl 4 , of<lb/> which the BINOL component can be easily recycled. These results will<lb/> contribute to future terpene total synthesis projects and increase<lb/> accessibility of rare materials from nature for human use.<lb/></p>
