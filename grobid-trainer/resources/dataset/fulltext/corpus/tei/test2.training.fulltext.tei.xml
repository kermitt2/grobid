			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>In premenopausal women, oestrogen receptor positive (ER+)<lb/> disease constitutes over 80% of breast cancers. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> The vast majority<lb/> of these patients will receive endocrine therapy, often by ovarian<lb/> ablation, although ER status is an imperfect predictor of response<lb/> to this therapy. In the postmenopausal setting, short-term<lb/> withdrawal of oestrogens using an aromatase inhibitor for two<lb/> weeks between a woman&apos;s diagnosis and surgery has been used<lb/> to assess the oestrogen dependence of ER+ breast cancers. <ref type="biblio">2-5<lb/></ref> However, it is not feasible to conduct a similar pharmacological<lb/> pre-surgical test in premenopausal patients as the drugs used,<lb/> tamoxifen or gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists, often<lb/> display early biochemical &quot;flare&quot; which would obscure molecular<lb/> changes over the first few weeks. <ref type="biblio">6,7</ref> As an alternative way of<lb/> measuring a tumour&apos;s oestrogen-dependency in the premeno-<lb/>pausal setting, we hypothesised that if there are predictable and<lb/> consistent differences in the expression of oestrogen-regulated<lb/> genes (ERGs) and proliferation-associated genes (PAGs) in<lb/> hormone-responsive ER+ breast tumours in premenopausal<lb/> women due to the large variations in plasma concentrations of<lb/> oestrogen (c.100pM to c.1000pM) and progesterone (&lt;3 nM to<lb/> &gt;50 nM) during the menstrual cycle, the absence of such change<lb/> could signify hormone insensitivity. This was driven by the<lb/> observation that the expression of ERGs in ER+ breast tumours<lb/> correlated strongly with circulating levels of oestradiol in<lb/> postmenopausal women. <ref type="biblio">8<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>In a retrospective study we found ERG expression to be<lb/> 50-200% higher in mid-to late cycle (days 7-26), when oestrogen<lb/> levels are higher, compared to very late or earlier in the cycle (days<lb/> 27-35 and 1-6) when oestrogen levels are lower. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> PAGs appeared<lb/> to have a lower level of expression in the progesterone-dominated<lb/> luteal phase of the cycle. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> We also demonstrated that RANKL<lb/> (TNFSF11), an archetypal progesterone-regulated gene (PRG),<lb/> increased over twofold in the luteal phase.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to postulating that these differences in gene<lb/> expression in ER+ breast cancer might have the potential to be<lb/> used in an endogenous test of endocrine responsiveness we<lb/> reasoned that hormone-dependent changes in gene expression<lb/> through the cycle could impact on the interpretation of commonly<lb/> measured biomarkers (e.g. PgR) and multigene prognostic<lb/> signatures (such as Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS), Prosigna<lb/> (PAM50), EndoPredict (EP) and Breast Cancer Index (BCI)). <ref type="biblio">11-14<lb/></ref> These signatures contain multiple ERGs and PAGs, whose<lb/> expression might vary in ER+ breast cancer according to when<lb/> during the menstrual cycle they are measured.<lb/></p>

			<p>The earlier studies were retrospective in nature and limited to<lb/> cross-sectional comparisons between single samples from<lb/> patients in pre-defined windows of the menstrual cycle. As such,<lb/> while differences in tumoural gene expression through the cycle<lb/> were recorded, actual changes within patients could only be<lb/> implied and the variability between patients in any such changes<lb/> could not be assessed. Here we directly ask (i) whether the<lb/> differences noted previously are explained by consistent within<lb/> patient changes in gene expression through the phases of the<lb/> menstrual cycle and (ii) if these changes reflect the sensitivity of<lb/> the tumours to oestrogen-deprivation and therefore can predict<lb/> the antiproliferative response to ovarian ablation.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head> 

			<head>Patient demographics<lb/></head>

			<p>Patient demographics are described separately for the two<lb/> independent prosepective studies in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. All<lb/> patients were ER+, 88% were PgR+ve and 9% HER2+ve; five of<lb/> the six HER2+ve cases were in the Vietnamese cohort.<lb/></p>

			<head>Serum hormone levels<lb/></head> 

			<p>Serum hormone concentrations showed the expected patterns of<lb/> change during the menstrual cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). Levels of oestradiol<lb/> were highest in W2 (median 845 pmol/L; 95% CI 413-991) with<lb/> little overlap of values in W1 (127 pmol/L; 95% CI 96-166);<lb/> concentrations in W3 (364 pmol/L; 95% CI 277-468) were<lb/> intermediate between those in W1 and W2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). There was<lb/> nearly complete separation of progesterone concentrations in W3<lb/> (21.5 nmol/L; 95% CI 12.1-30.1) from the low values in W1<lb/> (1.1 pmol/L; 95% CI 0.7-1.7) and W2 (1.7 pmol/L; 95% CI 0.8-2.3).<lb/></p>

			<head>Sample availability<lb/></head>

			<p>RNA was successfully extracted in paired tumour samples<lb/> (diagnosis and surgery) from 54 of the 70 patients recruited in<lb/> MenCER (Consort diagram, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Nine of these<lb/> patients were excluded due to ambiguous menstrual cycle data.<lb/> Overall, 45 patients with good quality gene expression and<lb/> consistent menstrual cycle data were available. The median time<lb/> between the tumour samples was 27 days (interquartile range<lb/> 20-34 days).<lb/></p>

			<p>In the Vietnamese study, paired FFPE tumour samples at<lb/> diagnosis and two weeks later (prior to OvX) were available for 35<lb/> of 56 patients (Consort diagram, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Of these,<lb/> RNA was successfully extracted for 27 sample pairs, seven of which<lb/> were excluded due to ambiguous menstrual cycle data, yielding a<lb/> final set of 20 patients. The median time between the tumour<lb/> samples was 9 days (interquartile range 8-13 days).<lb/></p>

			<p>Combining samples from the two studies gave a final group of<lb/> 65 patients with the following window comparisons available:<lb/> 15 same window comparisons (all MenCER); 14 comparisons of W1<lb/> vs. W2 (7 MenCER, 7 Vietnamese); 20 comparisons of W2 vs. W3<lb/> (14 M, 6 V); 10 comparisons of W1 vs. W3 (7 M, 3 V); 28<lb/> comparisons of W1 vs. (W2 or W3) (14 M, 14 V); 32 comparisons<lb/> of (W1 or W2) vs. W3 (23 M, 9 V) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>,<lb/> Supplementary Data 1).<lb/></p>

			<head>Unsupervised clustering of combined sample set<lb/></head>

			<p>Unsupervised clustering of the gene expression data from this<lb/> combined sample set of 130 samples showed that 52 of the 65<lb/> paired samples clustered together. There were four main clusters<lb/> apparent, labelled A-D in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Cluster A was enriched for<lb/> samples taken in W3 (24% W1, 24% W2, 52% W3) and showed the<lb/> lowest relative expression of PAGs, high expression of most ERGs<lb/> and high PRG expression. Cluster B comprised a more evenly<lb/> mixed group of tumours from the three windows (36% W1, 32%<lb/> W2, 32% W3) and segregated from cluster A based on relatively<lb/> higher PAG and lower PRG expression. Clusters C and D differed<lb/> from the other clusters on the basis of their lower expression of<lb/> ERGs and PRGs and contained 94% (15/16) of the PgR -ve samples.<lb/> Cluster D was enriched for tumour samples taken in W2 (25% W1,<lb/> 45% W2, 30% W3) and showed the highest relative expression of<lb/> PAGs and the lowest of PRGs and PGR (30% IHC PgR -ve). Overall,<lb/> in this combined dataset, PGR expression and the AvProg were<lb/> both inversely correlated to the expression of PAGs (Spearman r =<lb/> -0.29, p = 0.0007 and r = -0.36, p = 0.0007, respectively) (Sup-<lb/>plementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparison of gene expression changes in samples from the<lb/> same window of the menstrual cycle<lb/> </head>

			<p>We first assessed if there were any significant changes in gene<lb/> expression between the 15 tumour samples taken in the same<lb/> window of the menstrual cycle (but one cycle apart). Five of our<lb/> 45 selected genes (GEM, NFKB1A, PTGS2, STAT5A, ZFP36)<lb/> increased significantly (1.6-4.4-fold; FDR 0.04 to 0.0025; Supple-<lb/>mentary Data 2, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) between diagnosis and<lb/> surgery. It appears that the upregulation of these genes may be<lb/> related to longer time to fixation for the surgical samples rather<lb/> than study-related as four of these genes were also up regulated<lb/> in our studies of changes in gene expression in the absence of<lb/> drug-treatment. <ref type="biblio">15,16</ref> These five genes were excluded from<lb/> further analysis, as any changes in their expression between<lb/> windows could not be ascribed with confidence to menstrual<lb/> cycle effects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Gene expression changes during the menstrual cycle: individual<lb/> window comparisons<lb/></head> 

			<p>For the individual window comparison between W1 and W3 and<lb/> between W1 and W2, the sample size was small (n = 10 and 14<lb/> pairs respectively) and none of the changes in individual gene<lb/> expression reached significance after correction for multiple<lb/> testing (FDR &lt; 0.05; Supplementary Data 2). However, for the<lb/> comparison between W1 and W2 whilst no gene had an FDR &lt;<lb/> 0.05, the four ERGs comprising the AvERG increased 1.9-2.7 fold in<lb/> W2 compared to W1 (uncorrected p-values 0.003 to 0.068, FDR<lb/> 0.068 to 0.23). The expression of all seven PAGs also showed a<lb/> consistent trend to increase between W1 and W2 (FC 1.1-1.5;<lb/></p>

			<p>uncorrected p-values 0.002 to 0.19, FDR 0.13 to 0.36; Supplemen-<lb/>tary Data 2).<lb/></p>

			<p>Between W2 and W3 (n = 20 pairs), TFF1 and ATP6V1B1 both<lb/> decreased significantly (FC 0.47, BH = 0.008; FC 0.55, BH = 0.034,<lb/> respectively; Supplementary Data 2). Of note FKBP5, a putative<lb/> PRG, increased in 16 of the 20 tumours and this neared statistical<lb/> significance (FC 1.6, BH = 0.051). RANKL, which was expressed to a<lb/> very low extent, and other putative PRGs (RASSF5, EFHD1, TGFB3,<lb/> SGK3, SHROOM3, TNFSF10) did not consistently change between<lb/> W2 and W3.<lb/></p>

			<p>The AvERG showed significant changes between the three<lb/> windows (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.0002); increasing between W1 and<lb/> W2 (FC 2.2, p = 0.011), and decreasing between W2 and W3 (FC<lb/> 0.62, p = 0.006) and between W3 and W1 (FC 0.58, p = 0.01) (Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Proliferation gene expression (AvProlif), also varied significantly<lb/> (Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.012), increasing between W1 and W2 (FC<lb/> 1.41, p = 0.035) with non-significant decreases thereafter between<lb/> W2 and W3 (FC 0.95, p = 0.50) and W3 to W1 (FC 0.74, p = 0.084).<lb/> The AvProg showed a numerically higher level in W3 compared to<lb/> the other windows but this did not approach statistical<lb/> significance (FC 1.2-1.6, p = 0.19-0.23; Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Gene expression changes during the menstrual cycle: Window 1<lb/> vs. Window 2 or 3<lb/> </head>

			<p>A pre-specified comparison of W1 vs. a combined W2 or W3 (n =<lb/> 28) allowed for greater power for assessing the change from a low<lb/> to high/intermediate oestradiol exposure. The expression of 10<lb/> individual genes (eight ERGs and two PAGs) changed significantly<lb/> between W1 and W2 or W3, with all genes showing higher levels<lb/> in W2-W3 (FC 1.4-2.4; FDR 0.016-0.05; Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 2 Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression data from the combined sample set of 130 samples (65 pairs)<lb/></figure>

			<p>These genes included three of the four archetypal ERGs (GREB1,<lb/> PGR and TFF1) comprising the AvERG and five putative ERGs<lb/> (IGSF1, MSMB, SERPINA3, ATP6V1B1, CELSR2) whose expression was<lb/> previously shown to be down-regulated after OvX. 17 IGSF1 and<lb/> MSMB showed the greatest magnitude of change between the<lb/> windows (FC 2.4 and 2.3-fold respectively). In agreement with the<lb/> gene expression data, mean protein levels of PgR increased<lb/> between W1 and W2 or W3 (18.3% increase, p = 0.0015, FDR<lb/> 0.024; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) but this did not lead to a change in<lb/> PgR positive/negative status for any tumour. Protein levels of ER<lb/> and Ki67 did not show a statistically significant change between<lb/> W1 and W2 or W3 (p = 0.056, BH 0.11 and p = 0.33, BH = 0.42<lb/> respectively; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The AvERG (FC 1.9, p = 0.0005) and AvProlif (FC 1.3, p = 0.013)<lb/> increased significantly between W1 and W2-W3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The<lb/> AvProg response was more variable but there was a trend to<lb/> increase in W2-W3 (FC 1.4, p = 0.09). The changes in AvERG and<lb/> AvProlif showed a weak correlation but there was no obvious<lb/> relationship between AvProg and either AvERG or AvProlif<lb/> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Individually the genes comprising the<lb/> AvERG increased approximately twofold in W2-W3 compared to<lb/> W1 (FC 1.7-2.2; BH 0.011-0.06) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). A similar pattern was<lb/> observed for PAGs with the exception of AURKA, although the<lb/> change was not as large (FC 1.3-1.5, BH 0.035-0.11) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Correlation of response to oestrogen deprivation with the change<lb/> in AvERG between W1 vs. W2-W3<lb/> </head>

			<p>There was no correlation of the response to OvX in the<lb/> Vietnamese study, as measured by % change in Ki67 (r = -0.30,<lb/> p = 0.32) or AvProlif (r = -0.05, p = 0.89), with the change in<lb/> AvERG between W1 vs. W2-W3 in the small group of patients<lb/> in which this could be compared (n = 12-13) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Anecdotally,<lb/> there was only one clear HER2-ve non-responder to OvX by<lb/> Ki67 and this showed the least increase in AvERG between W1<lb/> vs. W2-W3.<lb/></p>

			<head>Gene expression changes during the menstrual cycle: Window 3<lb/> vs. Window 1 or 2<lb/></head>

			<p>The effects of the higher level of progesterone in W3 (roughly<lb/> corresponding to the luteal phase) compared to the rest of the<lb/> cycle were examined by comparing gene expression changes<lb/> between W3 vs. a combined W1 or W2 (n = 32) (Supplementary<lb/> Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). For this comparison, FKBP5, a<lb/> putative PRG, was the most significant gene and showed the<lb/> greatest fold-change (FC 1.5, p = 0.0057, BH = 0.23), increasing in<lb/> 24 of 32 tumours in W3. RANKL was the 5th most significant gene<lb/> and showed the second greatest increase (FC 1.4, p = 0.10, BH =<lb/> 0.65). Other putative PRGs changed to a lesser extent and with less<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 3 Changes in AvERG, AvProlif and AvProg between individual windows (FC; fold-change). Dotted red lines indicate change in mean level<lb/> between compared windows. Error bars indicate mean ± 95% CI<lb/> significance. </figure>

			<p>Overall, AvProg increased significantly in W3 (FC 1.5,<lb/> p = 0.026) but there were no significant changes in AvERG or<lb/> AvProlif. The change in AvProg showed a borderline significant<lb/> correlation with PGR expression (r = 0.34, p = 0.06), such that the<lb/> tumours with higher PGR expression showed a greater change in<lb/> AvProg.<lb/></p>

			<head>Unpaired analysis of differences in gene expression through<lb/> menstrual cycle<lb/> </head>

			<p>To determine the consistency of these data with our earlier cross-<lb/>sectional analysis we performed an exploratory unpaired analysis<lb/> of all samples assessing the differences in gene expression<lb/> between the three pre-defined windows (103 samples; 29 in W1,<lb/> 37 in W2, 37 in W3). The AvERG showed significant differences<lb/> between the three windows (KW p = 0.0014) with the highest<lb/> level in W2; W1 vs. W2 (FC 2.2; p = 0.0005), W2 vs. W3 (FC 0.63,<lb/> p = 0.015), W1 vs. W3 (FC 0.73, p = 0.14) (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The AvProlif<lb/> showed a trend to increase between W1 and W2 (FC 1.3, p = 0.07)<lb/> and there was a strong trend for the AvProg to be higher in W3;<lb/> W2 vs. W3 (FC 1.5, p = 0.056), W1 vs W3 (FC 0.66, p = 0.07).<lb/> Hierarchical clustering of the unpaired gene expression data<lb/> according to the window in which the sample was taken further<lb/> illustrates the differences in gene expression between windows<lb/> and also demonstrates the large variation that occurs within each<lb/> window (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>We have previously reported significant differences in the<lb/> expression of ERGs, PAGs and the PRG, RANKL, in ER+ tumours<lb/> in a retrospective study that related to the major changes in<lb/> hormone levels that occur during the menstrual cycle. 9,10 Here, we<lb/> have extended that observation in a prospective study to show<lb/> significant changes of gene expression of ERGs, PRGs and PAGs<lb/> within individual patients through the menstrual cycle and the<lb/> degree of variability in these changes between patients.<lb/></p>

			<p>Previous work investigating changes in breast tumour biology<lb/> during the menstrual cycle is limited and the data are very<lb/> variable <ref type="biblio">18-25</ref> which is most likely due to difficulties and differences<lb/> in assigning the phase of menstrual cycle. Here, both serum<lb/> hormone concentrations and menstural cycle data were used to<lb/> improve the definition of times through the mentrual cycle and to<lb/> assign patients to one of three pre-defined menstrual cycle<lb/> windows. Approximately 20% of cases were excluded due to<lb/> inconsistent menstrual cycle data. Windows 1 and 2 had low and<lb/> high E2 levels, respectively (up to a sevenfold difference) and very<lb/> low progesterone levels; window 3, which largely represents the<lb/> luteal phase, had mean levels of E2 intermediate between those of<lb/> windows 1 and 2 and up to 20-fold higher levels of progesterone.<lb/></p>

			<p>We combined tumour samples from patients in two indepen-<lb/>dent trials to increase the power of the study as individually the<lb/> separate studies would have been too small to reach meaningful<lb/> conclusions. Whilst the trials had some differences in their design<lb/> and patient demographics, unsupervised clustering of the gene<lb/> expression data generated did not reveal any clear study-related<lb/> effects.<lb/></p>

			<p>Tumour samples taken in the same window of the menstrual<lb/> cycle provided a control group and indicated that the expression<lb/> of five of our selected genes increased between diagnosis and<lb/> surgery irrespective of cycle window. The upregulation of these<lb/> genes does not appear to be study-related as four of these genes<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 4 Changes in AvERG, AvProlif and AvProg and in expression of their individual component ERGs, PAGs and PRGs between Window 1 vs.<lb/> Windows 2 or 3 (n = 28)<lb/></figure>

			<p>were also upregulated in studies of changes in gene expression in<lb/> the absence of drug-treatment <ref type="biblio">15,16</ref> where the upregulation was<lb/> ascribed to differences in the time taken to fixation for the<lb/> samples at the two time points. These five genes were thus<lb/> excluded from further analysis, as any changes in their expression<lb/> between different windows would not be attributable to<lb/> menstrual cycle effects.<lb/></p>

			<p>Unsupervised clustering of the gene expression data from all<lb/> samples showed that most pairs clustered together indicating that<lb/> the changes in gene expression during the menstrual cycle were<lb/> not as great as the variation between patients in the majority of<lb/> cases. Nonetheless, the clustering revealed contrasting clusters<lb/> enriched for tumours taken in W2 and W3 indicating the timing of<lb/> the menstrual cycle had some effect on the clustering. The cluster<lb/> enriched for W2 tumours showed the highest relative expression<lb/> of PAGs and the lowest of PRGs while the cluster enriched for W3<lb/> tumours showed the lowest relative expression of PAGs and high<lb/> PRG expression. This was reflected by an inverse correlation<lb/> between both PGR expression and signalling and proliferation<lb/> across all samples. These data are consistent with progesterone<lb/> receptor signalling modulating oestrogen-driven proliferation in<lb/> this premenopausal setting. The concept that PR activation in the<lb/> context of oestrogen-driven, ER+ breast cancer, can have an anti-<lb/>proliferative effect has been postulated by others <ref type="biblio">26,27</ref> and it seems<lb/> that the oestrogenic status can directly affect whether progesto-<lb/>gens are pro-proliferative or antiproliferative. Thus, in the absence<lb/> of a functional oestrogen-activated ER complex, PgR activation<lb/> can stimulate proliferation <ref type="biblio">28-30</ref> but when oestrogen and a<lb/> progestogen are combined, reductions in the oestrogen-induced<lb/> growth response have been reported both in vitro <ref type="biblio">28,31</ref> and<lb/> ex vivo. <ref type="biblio">26</ref> Mechanistically, it appears that in the presence of both<lb/> oestrogen and progesterone ligands, PR can affect ER target gene<lb/> activity by altering the interaction between ER and chromatin<lb/> thereby changing the transcriptional output of the ER<lb/> complex. <ref type="biblio">26,27<lb/></ref></p> 

			<p>The comparison of gene expression between W1 (low<lb/> oestradiol) with W2 (high oestradiol) was the most biologically<lb/> straightforward window comparison in terms of hormone levels<lb/> and this revealed a strong trend for an increase in ERG expression<lb/> between W1 and W2. Thus, the four ERGs comprising the AvERG (a<lb/> pre-defined composite measure of ERG expression) all increased<lb/> two to threefold in W2 compared to W1 but this did not reach<lb/> statistical significance most likely due to the small sample size<lb/> available. Comparison of W2 and W3 is less straightforward to<lb/> interpret as changes could be due to either the lower oestradiol<lb/> levels (approximately 50%), or the much higher progesterone<lb/> levels in W3 (&gt;10-fold) or both; the only two genes that changed<lb/> significantly were ERGs (TFF1, ATP6V1B1) which both decreased by<lb/> approximately 50% in W3. The AvERG, showed significant changes<lb/> between the three individual windows with a mean increase of<lb/> 220% between W1 and W2 and approximate 40% decreases<lb/> thereafter between W2 and W3 and between W3 and W1.<lb/></p>

			<p>To increase the power to detect changes in gene expression<lb/> from a low to high/intermediate oestradiol exposure we<lb/> performed a pre-specified comparison of W1 vs. a combined W2<lb/> or W3. This showed that the expression of eight ERGs significantly<lb/> increased (mean of 1.9-fold) between W1 and W2 or W3 including<lb/> three of the four ERGs (GREB1, PGR and TFF1) comprising the<lb/> AvERG. Similar to our earlier retrospective study, <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> the fourth<lb/> gene comprising the AvERG, PDZK1, did not show a significant<lb/> change in expression although it showed a strong trend to do so.<lb/> This is in agreement with a recent study which showed a<lb/> correlation of GREB1, PGR and TFF1 but not PDZK1 gene expression<lb/> in ER +ve tumours with serum oestradiol levels in premenopausal<lb/> patients. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> This latter study concurred with our earlier cross-<lb/>sectional study but lacked the longitudinal aspect of the current<lb/> study to allow consideration of within patient changes. Overall,<lb/> the AvERG showed a near twofold increase in expression between<lb/> W1 and W2 or W3. This compared to a difference of 1.5-fold<lb/> between the same windows in the retrospective study. <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> Of the<lb/> other putative ERGs that changed significantly between W1 and<lb/> W2 or W3, IGSF1, a member of the immunoglobulin-like domain-<lb/>containing superfamily and MSMB, an immunoglobulin binding<lb/> factor showed the greatest magnitude of change. Both of these<lb/> genes have been reported to have inhibin activity, <ref type="biblio">33,34</ref> which may<lb/> be a factor in their increase in expression in W2-W3 vs. W1.<lb/></p>

			<p>An unpaired analysis to assess differences rather than changes<lb/> in gene expression between the three pre-defined windows<lb/> demonstrated that the AvERG showed significant differences<lb/> between all windows, mirroring the paired changes reported<lb/> above, and these showed the same pattern to the previous cross-<lb/>sectional retrospective study. <ref type="biblio">9,10<lb/></ref></p> 

			<p>The expression of PAGs across the menstrual cycle mirrored the<lb/> changes observed in ERG expression but the magnitude of effect<lb/> was less. Thus, between W1 and W2, individual PAGs showed a<lb/> trend to increase between W1 and W2 such that the AvProlif, a<lb/> pre-defined composite measure of PAG expression, showed<lb/> significant changes between the three windows characterised<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 5 Correlation of change in AvERG during menstrual cycle (Window 1 vs. Windows 2 or 3) with % change in Ki67 (a) and % change in<lb/> AvProlif (b) after OvX; • HER2+ ve tumours<lb/></figure>

			<p>particularly by a mean increase of 40% between W1 and W2.<lb/> Comparison of W1 vs. W2 or W3 revealed significant increases in<lb/> the expression of two individual PAGs and a 30% increase of the<lb/> AvProlif in W2 or W3 compared to W1. These data are in slight<lb/> contrast to our earlier report of lower PAG expression in W3 with<lb/> no difference between W1 and W2. 9,10 However, the unpaired<lb/> analysis of the current data demonstrated a very similar pattern of<lb/> expression of AvProlif to the previous retrospective study with a<lb/> decline in proliferation at the end of W2 (days <ref type="biblio">13-16</ref>) such that<lb/> the AvProlif is near its nadir at the start of W3.<lb/></p>

			<p>The RANK signalling pathway is known to be a key paracrine<lb/> mediator of progestogen action in breast epithelium and its<lb/> protein expression has been shown to correlate with serum<lb/> progesterone levels. <ref type="biblio">35,36</ref> We previously reported twofold higher<lb/> levels of RANKL in W3, roughly corresponding to the luteal phase<lb/> of the menstrual cycle, when progesterone levels are at their<lb/> highest, compared to the other windows 10 and this has also been<lb/> observed by others. <ref type="biblio">37</ref> Here, we measured RANKL and 10 other<lb/> putative PRGs to investigate if changes in their expression during<lb/> the menstrual cycle were apparent and used the AvProg as a<lb/> composite measure of PRG gene expression. Whilst the number of<lb/> samples available between W1 and W3 was too small to detect<lb/> any significant changes in individual gene expression, comparison<lb/> of W2 and W3 showed that FKBP5 increased in 80% of the tumours<lb/> in W3 and this was borderline significant. However, RANKL itself<lb/> did not show an increased level of expression in W3, possibly<lb/> because it was expressed to a very low extent in this group of<lb/> tumours. The AvProg did not show any significant changes<lb/> between the individual windows but showed a trend to increase<lb/> in W3 compared to the other windows. A comparison of W3 with a<lb/> combined W1 or W2 increased the power to compare the effects<lb/> of a high progesterone milieu in W3 with the much lower<lb/> progesterone levels in W1 or W2 and demonstrated that the<lb/> AvProg increased significantly in W3 as would be expected due to<lb/> the much higher level of progesterone in W3 compared to the rest<lb/> of the cycle. These changes in PRGs were more modest than those<lb/> in ERG and PAG expression across the cycle as a whole.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to investigate if the changes in gene expression in ER+<lb/> breast cancer during the menstrual cycle we report here could<lb/> predict the antiproliferative response to ovarian ablation we<lb/> correlated the change in AvERG between W1 and W2 or W3 with<lb/> the response to OvX in samples from the Vietnamese study. <ref type="biblio">17<lb/></ref> Only a very weak correlation was observed. Although this analysis<lb/> had only low power due to the small number of samples available,<lb/> even with this small number it appears that this putative<lb/> endogenous test of hormonal sensitivity could not be sufficiently<lb/> reliable for clinical use.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main weakness of the current work was the relatively low<lb/> proportion of patients available for comparisons of the individual<lb/> windows of the menstrual cycle, even after combining patient<lb/> samples from two independent studies. Combining windows<lb/> enabled greater power but in some cases (e.g. combining W2 and<lb/> W3) also added possible confounding factors such as widely<lb/> differing progesterone concentrations within the combined<lb/> window. Despite this, the impact of changes in endogenous<lb/> reproductive hormones on gene expression was demonstrated<lb/> very clearly.<lb/></p>

			<p>The multigene prognostic signatures which are commonly used<lb/> in ER+ breast cancer such as RS, PAM50, EP and BCI, <ref type="biblio">11-14</ref> contain<lb/> mulitple ERGs and PAGs and it is well established that the<lb/> expression of these genes are two of the main drivers of the<lb/> scores obtained from these tests. <ref type="biblio">38</ref> Thus, the possibility that<lb/> the hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle could affect the<lb/> read out from these signatures merits study and we are<lb/> investigating this hypothesis in a follow-up study.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, our data indicate that there are significant<lb/> changes in ERG, PRG and PAG expression in line with the<lb/> hormone changes that occur during the menstrual cycle. These<lb/></p>

			<p>changes need to be noted in any studies of the hormone-related<lb/> biology of breast cancer in premenopausal patients and may<lb/> affect the interpretation of data from some of the multigene<lb/> prognostic signatures which are commonly used in ER+ breast<lb/> cancer.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/></head> 
			<head>Patients and study designs<lb/></head>

			<p>Patients were drawn from two prospective studies that assessed the<lb/> possible impact of the menstrual cycle on breast tumour biology in ER+<lb/> breast cancer. The first of these was MenCER (The Menstrual cycle as a test<lb/> of endocrine responsiveness in premenopausal breast cancer), a UK-based<lb/> multicentre study. In addition, menstrual cycle effects were studied in<lb/> patients from a study of neoadjuvant oophorectomy (OvX) in Vietnam. The<lb/> endocrine and molecular effects of OvX in this Vietnamese study have<lb/> been recently published. <ref type="biblio">17<lb/></ref></p> 

			<p>For the MenCER study, premenopausal women aged &lt;50 years old with<lb/> histologically confirmed ER+ breast cancer who were proceeding to<lb/> surgery with no pre-surgical therapy, had a regular menstrual cycle and<lb/> had not received previous cancer therapy were eligible. Ethical approval<lb/> for the study was received from the local research ethics committee (South<lb/> West London REC 3). All participants provided written informed consent.<lb/> Paired blood and tumour samples were taken both at diagnosis and at<lb/> surgery with no treatment occurring between these time-points. Patient<lb/> reported date of last menstrual period and length of cycle were recorded.<lb/> The timing of surgery in relation to menstrual cycle was not controlled in<lb/> any way and it was expected that the menstrual phase at the time of<lb/> diagnosis and surgery for any given subject would be a chance event. We<lb/> also reasoned that the time between diagnosis and surgery would be<lb/> approximately two weeks and therefore in most patients would involve<lb/> different parts of their menstrual cycle. An accrual target of 70 patients was<lb/> selected on the basis of power calculations based on the magnitude of<lb/> changes (twofold) in ERGs we observed in our previous retrospective<lb/> studies. <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> With 70 paired comparisons between the groups it would be<lb/> possible to detect a standardised difference of 0.5 between the groups for<lb/> each of the biomarkers with 80% power, and a standardised difference of<lb/> 0.6 with 90% power.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Vietnamese study was a single arm study of neoadjuvant OvX in<lb/> patients with ER+ breast cancer, details of which have been described<lb/> previously. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> In brief, the study recruited 56 premenopausal women with<lb/> ER+ breast cancer for whom modified radical mastectomy and surgical<lb/> bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was planned as part of their breast cancer<lb/> treatment. Patients had to report regular menstrual cycles and must not<lb/> have received any prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for their cancer.<lb/> The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the<lb/> National Cancer Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam from where all study participants<lb/> were recruited and by the Research Ethics Board of the University of<lb/> Toronto, Canada, from where the study was coordinated. The Committee<lb/> for Clinical Research at the Royal Marsden Hospital, London approved the<lb/> analysis of the samples collected in this trial. All participants provided<lb/> written informed consent. Breast tumour core biopsies (formalin fixed and<lb/> paraffin embedded) taken at diagnosis (A) and intra-operatively at the time<lb/> of OvX (B; 2 weeks later) were used in the current study. No treatment<lb/> occurred between these time-points. A single blood sample taken pre-OvX<lb/> (on day of OvX prior to anaesthesia or pre-operative medication; timepoint<lb/> B) was available for hormone measurements. Similar to the MenCER study,<lb/> the timing of surgery in relation to menstrual cycle was not controlled.<lb/></p>

			<p>Exclusion criteria for both studies included: metastatic disease, use of<lb/> oral contraceptives or other hormonal contraceptives and concomitant use<lb/> of medications known to influence oestrogen levels. Informed consent was<lb/> obtained from all participants.<lb/></p>

			<head>Serum hormone measurements<lb/></head>

			<p>Serum concentrations of oestradiol (E2) were measured by radioimmu-<lb/>noassay following pre-assay purification using an organic extraction as<lb/> described previously. <ref type="biblio">39,40</ref> Progesterone was measured using a solid phase<lb/> radioimmunoassay (Beckman Coulter IM1188). LH and FSH were measured<lb/> using immunoradiometric assays (IBL International MG12151 and Dia-<lb/>source KIP0841 respectively). The serum hormone measurements were<lb/> used in combination with menstrual cycle information to ascribe patients<lb/> to one of three pre-defined menstrual cycle windows prior to considera-<lb/>tion of the biomarker data: window 1 (W1; low oestrogen and<lb/> progesterone milieu) days 27-35 or 1-6; window 2 (W2; high oestrogen<lb/> and low progesterone milieu) days 7-16; window 3 (W3; intermediate<lb/> oestrogen and high progesterone milieu) days 17-26 (Supplementary Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">2)</ref>. In six patients one of the sample pairs fell on the cusp of two windows<lb/> (two between W1 and W2, four between W2 and W3; Supplementary Data<lb/> 1); these samples were not used in the individual window comparisons but<lb/> were included when W1 and W2 or W2 and W3 were combined.<lb/></p>

			<head>Immunohistochemistry<lb/></head>

			<p>Hematoxylin and eosin sections were prepared for all FFPE tumour<lb/> samples and were reviewed to confirm diagnosis and assess tumour<lb/> content. Samples with tumour content &lt;40% were excluded from further<lb/> analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scoring for ER, PgR and Ki67<lb/> were performed as reported previously. <ref type="biblio">41,42</ref> ER and PgR were considered<lb/> positive if ≥1% cells stained positive. HER2 was measured immunohisto-<lb/>chemically using the HercepTest (DakoCytomation) and by fluorescent<lb/> in situ hybridization (Vysis Pathvysion, Downers Grove, IL) according to<lb/> manufacturer&apos;s instructions. HER2 was considered positive if immunohis-<lb/>tochemical staining was scored 3+ or 2+ if the fluorescence in situ<lb/> hybridization analysis indicated an amplification ratio of &gt;2.0. 41<lb/></p>

			<head>Gene selection<lb/></head>

			<p>Selection of genes for analysis in the biopsies was based on the set of<lb/> genes we measured previously in a retrospective cross-sectional study. <ref type="biblio">10<lb/></ref> This previous set of genes comprised ESR1, 26 ERGs and putative ERGs that<lb/> correlated with variations in plasma E2 concentrations, seven PAGs and a<lb/> single PRG, RANKL. ERGs whose expression did not differ in the<lb/> retrospective study were replaced with 16 other ERGs and putative ERGs<lb/> based on the observation that they were the most highly up or down-<lb/>regulated after OvX. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> For the PAGs, we selected four of those measured<lb/> previously plus three other PAGs that were the most down-regulated after<lb/> OvX. In addition to RANKL, we selected 10 other putative PRGs for<lb/> measurement based on commonality in at least two literature reports <ref type="biblio">26,43-48<lb/></ref> and Mohammed 20 personal communication. In total, 45 genes of interest<lb/> (18 genes in common with the previous study 10 ) were selected for gene<lb/> expression measurement (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). We used the AvERG (average ERGs; the<lb/> geomean of PGR, GREB1, TFF1 and PDZK1 8 ) as a composite measure of ERG<lb/> expression, the AvProlif (average PAGs; geomean of AURKA, CDC20, MKI67,<lb/> TOP2A, UBE2C) as a composite measure of PAGs and the AvProg (average<lb/> PRGs; geomean of FKBP5 and RANKL) as a composite measure of PRG<lb/> expression. We also measured five housekeeping genes (ACTB, MRPL19,<lb/> PSMC4, SF3A1, TBP).<lb/></p>

			<head>Measurement of gene expression<lb/></head>

			<p>Total RNA was extracted from two 10 μm sections of formalin-fixed<lb/> paraffin-embedded breast tumour samples using the RecoverAll (Ambion)<lb/> kit according to the manufacturer&apos;s procedure. The NanoString nCounter<lb/> gene expression system (GEN2) (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA)<lb/> was used to measure gene expression without target amplification. <ref type="biblio">49</ref> In<lb/> brief, an nCounter CodeSet (NanoString Technologies) containing gene-<lb/>specific probe-pairs for the 50 genes selected above (including the five<lb/> housekeeping genes) as well as six exogenous positive control RNA<lb/> targets, and eight exogenous negative control sequences, was hybridised<lb/> to 200 ng total RNA in a single 30 μl hybridization reaction. After overnight<lb/> hybridization (15-21 h) at 65°C, the samples were processed using the<lb/> NanoString nCounter Prep Station and Digital Analyzer according to the<lb/> manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Assay validity was confirmed by assessing the<lb/> linearity of six internal positive RNA controls and the non-specific<lb/> background from signal in eight internal negative controls included in<lb/> each reaction. The raw nCounter counts for each gene of interest were<lb/> corrected for background by subtracting the geometric mean of the<lb/> negative controls, normalised to the geometric mean of the five<lb/> housekeeping genes to allow for variation in the amount and quality of<lb/> input RNA and log2 transformed (Supplementary Data 1; raw gene<lb/> expression data; Supplementary Data 3; normalised log-transformed data).<lb/> The housekeeping genes did not show any significant changes in<lb/> expression between individual windows or between the combinations of<lb/> windows (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Data analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>For paired data, we performed pre-specified analyses of changes in the<lb/> gene expression levels between individual windows (W1 vs. W2, W2 vs. W3,<lb/> W3 vs. W1) and combinations of windows (W1 vs. [W2 or W3]; [W1 or W2]<lb/> vs. W3) using the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. For unpaired<lb/> data, differences in gene expression between the three windows were<lb/> compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test and differences in gene expression<lb/> levels between the specific windows were assessed using the Mann<lb/> Whitney test (Graphpad Prism 7). To calculate the AvERG, AvProlif and<lb/> AvProg the geometric mean of the individual gene expression values of<lb/> the indicated genes was taken and log-transformed. For individual genes<lb/> the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to the calculate false<lb/> discovery rate (FDR) in order to adjust for multiple testing.<lb/></p>
