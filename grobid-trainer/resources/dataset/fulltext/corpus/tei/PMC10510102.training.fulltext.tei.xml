			<p>The impact of cysteine-targeting covalent modifiers has<lb/> spurred interest in the development of complementary<lb/> &quot;beyond-cysteine&quot; approaches to target additional amino acid<lb/> residues and thus expand applicability across the proteome<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). <ref type="biblio">1-5</ref> Sulfur(VI) fluorides (SFs) have emerged as<lb/> useful electrophiles for this application, targeting multiple<lb/> nucleophilic amino acid residues, including lysine, <ref type="biblio">6</ref> tyrosine, <ref type="biblio">7<lb/></ref> and serine. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> The prevalence of these residues in almost all<lb/> protein pockets makes SFs promising functional groups for the<lb/> development of covalent inhibitors for proteins and expansion<lb/> of the liganded proteome. <ref type="biblio">9-16</ref> Recently, several SF-containing<lb/> modulators have been reported, which enabled covalent<lb/> modification of protein pockets without targeting a cysteine.<lb/> Examples include &quot;XO44&quot; for broad-spectrum kinase profil-<lb/>ing, <ref type="biblio">17</ref> various SF-containing ligands for targeting G protein-<lb/>coupled receptors including the human adenosine A 3<lb/> receptor, <ref type="biblio">18</ref> and &quot;EM12-SO 2 F&quot;/&quot;EM12-FS&quot; which modulate<lb/> cereblon. <ref type="biblio">19</ref> These were developed by structure-based, rational<lb/> installation of the SF group on optimized noncovalent<lb/> scaffolds. The development of complementary &quot;bottom-up&quot;<lb/> approaches will be useful for discovering ligands for targets that<lb/> have low tractability to noncovalent ligands. <ref type="biblio">20<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>Reactive fragment screening has emerged as a useful strategy<lb/> for the discovery of chemical probes for protein targets of<lb/> interest. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> These approaches couple the utility of fragments in<lb/> enabling the efficient coverage of chemical space, with a<lb/> reactive functionality that traps weak protein-ligand inter-<lb/>actions to improve binding, and enable robust detection by<lb/> intact protein liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry<lb/> (LC-MS) (Figure <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). <ref type="biblio">22,23</ref> Covalent capture provides access<lb/> to a suite of follow-up studies that further characterize the<lb/> interaction, including determination of the site(s) of binding,<lb/> measurement of kinetic parameters, and assessment of in-cell<lb/> target engagement. <ref type="biblio">3,24,25</ref> To date, the approach has been<lb/> limited to cysteine-targeting covalent inhibitors for challenging<lb/> targets, including HOIP and KRAS G12C , which led to the<lb/> discovery of the Food and Drug Administration-approved<lb/> therapeutic AMG 510. <ref type="biblio">3,26</ref> Chemistries that enable the<lb/> screening of electrophilic libraries to target alternative<lb/> nucleophilic residues would greatly expand the number of<lb/> proteins that are amenable to reactive fragment screening<lb/> technologies.<lb/></p>

			<head>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>The SF-based reactive fragment screening approach was<lb/> developed in two stages: first, the development of an<lb/> appropriate SF fragment library and second, the application<lb/> of this library in screens against three protein targets. A<lb/> modular library was employed by linking a diverse set of<lb/> amine-functionalized fragments to an SF-containing reactive<lb/> moiety. Three SFs were selected that spanned a range of<lb/> intrinsic reactivities, based on previous profiling of SF<lb/> functionalities. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> These included aromatic sulfonyl fluorides 1<lb/> (meta-substituted) and 2 (para-substituted with a methylene<lb/> spacer), as well as sulfamoyl fluoride 3 (azetidine-linked)<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>HTC Synthesis of an SF-Reactive Fragment Library.<lb/> An HTC protocol for the generation of the reactive fragment<lb/> libraries was pursued to enable the rapid generation of SF<lb/> fragments in 384-well plates. This allowed for screening in a<lb/> D2B format as crude reaction mixtures, circumventing the<lb/> requirement for purification and thus accelerating reactive<lb/> fragment library screens. <ref type="biblio">29<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>A succinimide-activated (OSu) amide coupling was<lb/> employed using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N-ethyl-<lb/>morpholine (NEM) as the solvent and base, respectively. <ref type="biblio">29<lb/></ref> The conditions were initially trialed on a panel of 12 diverse<lb/> amine-functionalized fragments by the addition of SF-reactive<lb/> moieties (1a, 2a, and 3a) in both dry DMSO and DMSO/<lb/> water (9:1) to assess robustness to hydrolysis under the<lb/> reaction conditions. After 1 h incubation, reactions with OSu<lb/> esters 2a and 3a afforded good conversion to the desired<lb/> products and tolerance of 10% water, while meta-substituted<lb/> OSu ester 1a gave poorer conversions due to hydrolysis of the<lb/> SF group to the sulfonic acid (see Figures <ref type="figure">S1 and S2</ref>). <ref type="biblio">14</ref> Thus,<lb/> compounds 2a and 3a were selected for library synthesis. Over<lb/> longer incubation times, the SF products were observed to<lb/> slowly hydrolyze to the sulfonic acids under the basic reaction<lb/> conditions. As such, library synthesis was performed using a 1<lb/> h reaction incubation time, followed by direct transfer to<lb/> protein-containing buffer solution to limit base catalyzed<lb/> hydrolysis of the SF fragments.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two 352-membered SF-reactive fragment libraries were<lb/> subsequently synthesized employing para-substituted reactive<lb/> moiety 2 and azetidine-linked reactive moiety 3. A set of 352<lb/> amine-functionalized fragments were selected from the GSK<lb/> compound collection by first filtering for fragment-like<lb/> properties (aromatic ring count ≤2; HBDs/HBAs ≤4; heavy<lb/> atoms ≤ 15; 150 &lt; M W ≤ 250) and then selecting for maximal<lb/> chemical diversity by clustering on chemical fingerprints (see<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). <ref type="biblio">30</ref> Owing to the slow hydrolysis of the products<lb/> under basic reaction conditions, it was not possible to perform<lb/> LC-MS analysis of the whole plate, which would require ∼24<lb/> h. Thus, LC-MS analysis was performed on six wells selected<lb/> at random, which indicated good conversion to the desired<lb/> products, and conversions were found to be highly<lb/> reproducible across three library syntheses conducted on<lb/> separate occasions (see Figure <ref type="figure">S4</ref>). The high yields and<lb/> reproducibility observed were consistent with related HTC-<lb/>D2B protocols developed in our group employing photo-<lb/>reactive fragments. <ref type="biblio">29<lb/></ref> </p>
			
			<p>D2B Screening against a Range of Purified Proteins.<lb/> A panel of three proteins were selected for screening SF-<lb/>reactive fragment libraries: CAII, KRAS4B G12D , and BCL6.<lb/> These proteins were selected to sample broad structural<lb/> diversity and biological function while also being of therapeutic<lb/> relevance. None of the proteins contain a catalytic nucleophilic<lb/> amino acid residue, which allowed us to probe the utility of the<lb/> SFs in targeting nucleophilic amino acid residues present in the<lb/> vicinity of binding pockets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Initially, the more reactive library, containing para-<lb/>substituted aryl sulfonyl fluoride 2, was screened against the<lb/> three proteins (24 h incubation, 4 or 20 °C) and directly<lb/> analyzed by intact protein LC-MS (0.5 or 1 μM protein and<lb/> 20 or 50 μM SF) (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). Across all screens, the majority<lb/> of wells contained unmodified protein, indicating that the SF-<lb/>reactive moieties were not yielding nonspecific covalent<lb/> modifications. However, for some of the wells, the resultant<lb/> mass spectra displayed additional peaks with mass shifts<lb/> consistent with the covalent modification of the protein by the<lb/> SF fragment, accompanied by the loss of HF as expected for<lb/> the reaction between the nucleophilic amino acid residue with<lb/> the SF group: [protein + SF -HF]. A range of modification<lb/> yields were observed, and the hit threshold for each screen was<lb/> defined as the mean percentage modification + 2 standard<lb/> deviations. Hits were also prioritized based on the overall<lb/> extent of modification, with some showing modification greater<lb/> than 50% (e.g., 2b-e with CAII), while others showed<lb/> modification less than 50% (e.g., 2f-i with BCL6) (Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>).<lb/> All hits gave a single modification event on the protein,<lb/> consistent with recognition-driven modification. Hits contain-<lb/>ing reactive moiety 2 from the screens against CAII and BCL6<lb/> were resynthesized and purified for use in further inves-<lb/>tigations. Disappointingly, no hits were observed for<lb/> KRAS G12D , consistent with the fact that this is considered to<lb/> be a poorly tractable target. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> The library containing the less-<lb/>reactive sulfamoyl fluoride 3 was screened against CAII but<lb/> afforded no hits, suggesting an insufficient intrinsic reactivity of<lb/> the electrophile.<lb/></p>

			<p>Site(s) of Binding for CAII Hits. Carbonic anhydrase II<lb/> (CAII) is a metalloenzyme responsible for the interconversion<lb/> of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate for which noncovalent<lb/> inhibitors have been developed as treatments for glaucoma,<lb/> oedema, and cancer. <ref type="biblio">31,32</ref> CAII inhibitors are typically based on<lb/> aromatic sulfonamide pharmacophores, which interact with the<lb/> Zn 2+ ion via the sulfonamide group. <ref type="biblio">33<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>The HTC-D2B screen with CAII afforded four hits (2b-e)<lb/> with modification yields of 66-75% (see Figure <ref type="figure">S5</ref>). Three of<lb/> these hits contained an aromatic sulfonamide, consistent with<lb/> known inhibitors, while one of the four (2c) was an aliphatic<lb/> sulfonamide, of which there are few prior reports. These four<lb/> compounds were the only primary sulfonamides in the library,<lb/> and the remainder of the library gave an average modification<lb/> yield of &lt;1%, indicating negligible nonspecific modification<lb/> and high specificity of the hit fragment interactions.<lb/></p>

			<p>The site of binding was investigated by displacement<lb/> studies. <ref type="biblio">34</ref> For this, we used the CAII inhibitor ethoxzolamide<lb/> (4) (K i = 8 nM), which is known to bind within the Zn 2+<lb/> pocket. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> The resynthesized and purified SFs (100 μM) were<lb/> coincubated with either ethoxzolamide (50 μM) or DMSO as<lb/> a control, with CAII (0.5 μM). Inspection of the resultant mass<lb/> spectra after a 24 h incubation revealed that the presence of<lb/> ethoxzolamide had abolished covalent modification for all hits<lb/> 2b-e, indicating binding to the same site (Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Tandem MS analyses were subsequently employed for<lb/> identification of the amino acid residue(s) that was covalently<lb/> modified. Samples of CAII modified by the resynthesized and<lb/> purified SFs 2d and 2e were digested using trypsin and<lb/> analyzed by LC-MS/MS. This identified peptides 59 ILNN-<lb/>GH*AFNVEFDDSQDKAVLK 80 and 59 ILNNGH*AFN-<lb/>VEFDDSQDK 76 as the major site(s) of modification on<lb/> His64 for both 2d (366 Da) (see Figure <ref type="figure">S6</ref>) and 2e (380 Da)<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>), respectively. Further to this, minor modifications<lb/> were observed on the N-terminal peptide 1 MSHHWGYGK 9 at<lb/> His3 (2d and 2e) and Tyr7 (2d only).<lb/></p>

			<p>To rationalize these observations, virtual dockings were<lb/> carried out on SFs 2d and 2e, based on the reported binding<lb/> mode of ethoxzolamide (PDB: 3CAJ). For 2e, the docking<lb/> indicated that the sulfonamide was bound to the Zn 2+ cofactor,<lb/> and the His64 residue was proximal to the SF group, just 7 Å<lb/> away, and appears well poised for reaction (Figures <ref type="figure">3c</ref> and<lb/></p>

			<p><ref type="figure">S7</ref>). <ref type="biblio">35</ref> Similarly, for 2d, the Zn 2+ -sulfonamide interaction was<lb/> observed, and the SF group was in the vicinity of His64, as well<lb/> as residues His3 and Tyr7 which were also found to carry<lb/> minor modifications (see Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Kinetic Analyses of CAII Hits. The kinetics of binding<lb/> were investigated by incubation of the resynthesized and<lb/> purified SFs 2b-e with CAII at a range of concentrations and<lb/> analysis by intact protein LC-MS over a 24 h period (see<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). The concentration-response was analyzed based<lb/> on a two-step model of reversible ligand (L) binding and<lb/> subsequent irreversible covalent modification of the protein<lb/> (P) (P + L ⇌ P•L → PL) (see Figure <ref type="figure">S10</ref>). <ref type="biblio">24</ref> Time courses<lb/> were fit to a single exponential function to give a k obs for each<lb/> concentration (Figure <ref type="figure">3d</ref>). These were then fitted using a<lb/> Michaelis-Menten model to determine k inact (corresponding<lb/> to the rate of covalent-bond formation) and K I (corresponding<lb/> to the recognition of the ligand for the protein pocket) (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">3e,f</ref>). All fragments were found to have strong reversible<lb/> affinity (K I ), and these were below the minimum concentration<lb/> screened for 2d and 2e (&lt;5 μM). This is consistent with the<lb/> strong binding of aryl sulfonamides to the CAII Zn 2+ binding<lb/> pocket. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> The SFs exhibited unexpectedly slow rates of<lb/> covalent modification, with 50% modification achieved<lb/> between 6.5 and 10.5 h for all 100 μM conditions. The slow<lb/> rate of the reaction may be attributed to a suboptimal<lb/> trajectory of the SF group toward the His64 residue in the<lb/> reversible bound conformation and/or low nucleophilicity of<lb/> the residue. <ref type="biblio">14<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>An advantage of the HTC-D2B approach taken with this<lb/> screening strategy is the opportunity to rapidly explore iterative<lb/> libraries of compounds which are structurally similar to the<lb/> original hits identified. Such iteration-based screens allow for<lb/> faster design-make-test cycles in contrast to traditional<lb/> methods in early-stage drug discovery, leading to the more<lb/> efficient identification of potent and selective probes. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> To<lb/> explore whether any alternative sulfonamide-containing frag-<lb/>ments would give high modification yields at a faster rate, a<lb/> new library was designed. For this, 96 amine-functionalized<lb/> fragment analogues of hits 2b-e were selected, coupled to<lb/> OSu ester 2a, and the resultant library was incubated with<lb/> CAII for 1 h prior to analysis by intact protein LC-MS.<lb/> Inspection of the resultant mass spectra after this short<lb/> incubation revealed many fragment hits that exhibited<lb/> significantly higher modification yields (&gt;70%, see Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">S11</ref>) when compared with the original hits (&lt;15% at 1 h, see<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">3d</ref>). This improvement in rate of modification is<lb/> particularly notable given that the second-generation HTC-<lb/>D2B library would be unlikely to have 100% purity as<lb/> compared to the purified hits from the first-generation library.<lb/> The improvement in potency demonstrates the utility of the<lb/> HTC-D2B approach as a means to rapidly optimize kinetic<lb/> parameters, with respect to both reversible recognition (K i )<lb/> and also the electrophile trajectory in determining k inact .<lb/></p>

			<p>Assessment of Target Engagement in Cells for CAII<lb/> Hits. Hits from the CAII screen were progressed to<lb/> chemoproteomic profiling to determine cellular target engage-<lb/>ment and to measure their off-target profiles. SFs 2d and 2e<lb/> were functionalized with an alkyne handle at the linking amide<lb/> group to give probes 2j and 2k. A structurally similar negative<lb/> control was also designed by substitution of the sulfonamide<lb/> for a methoxy group, 2l (Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref>). The three probes were<lb/> first incubated with purified CAII, which confirmed that SFs 2j<lb/> and 2k covalently modified CAII following addition of the<lb/> alkyne group and that the methoxy group-containing negative<lb/> control 2l did not. The proteins engaged by these three probes<lb/> were subsequently studied in HEK293T cells.<lb/></p>

			<p>HEK293T cells were treated for 1 h with probes 2j, 2k, or 2l<lb/> (10 μM) or the DMSO vehicle. Competition-based experi-<lb/>ments were also conducted where cells were pretreated with<lb/> parent hits 2d (40 μM) or 2e (40 μM) for 1 h, before the<lb/> addition of alkyne-containing probes 2j (10 μM) or 2k (10<lb/> μM), respectively. Following incubation, treated cells were<lb/> lysed and conjugated with biotin-azide by Cu-click, and<lb/> biotinylated proteins were enriched using NeutrAvidin beads.<lb/> Enriched proteins were digested with LysC and trypsin, prior<lb/> to analysis by LC-MS/MS (Figure <ref type="figure">4b</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>All three probes (2j-l) were found to enrich multiple<lb/> proteins by comparison to the DMSO control (523, 501, and<lb/> 447, respectively, log 2 ratio ≥0.58, p-value ≤0.05, and #unique<lb/> peptides ≥2), highlighting the promiscuity of the reactive<lb/> fragments in this environment. A good correlation was<lb/> observed between all three probes and the proteins enriched,<lb/> indicating that most of the enrichment was driven by the SF<lb/> moiety, rather than the fragment portion of the probes (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">4c</ref>). The most significantly enriched proteins included FABP5,<lb/> APMAP, and CRABP2. Previous reports identified that FABP5<lb/> and CRABP2 were targeted by an arylfluorosulfate probe by<lb/> reaction at a tyrosine residue in each of these proteins. <ref type="biblio">36</ref> While<lb/> some enrichment of CAII was observed for 2j and 2k, this was<lb/> poorly resolved among the many other enriched proteins. To<lb/> further investigate CAII engagement of the sulfonamide-<lb/>containing active probes (2j and 2k) in live cells, we compared<lb/> the enriched proteins to those enriched by the methoxy-<lb/>containing negative control (2l). This highlighted CAII as one<lb/> of the few differentially enriched proteins, suggesting that the<lb/> aryl sulfonamide fragment hits were driving cellular engage-<lb/>ment of CAII (Figure <ref type="figure">4d,e</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Interestingly, competition experiments with 2d and 2e<lb/> showed relatively few significantly competed proteins,<lb/> suggesting that many of the interactions involved substoichio-<lb/>metric binding. This was true for CAII, where neither probes<lb/> 2j nor 2k showed competition with parents 2d or 2e,<lb/> respectively. This is consistent with the slow rate of covalent<lb/> modification of CAII by 2d and 2e in the biochemical kinetic<lb/> analyses, which suggested that the protein would only be<lb/> partially modified after a 1 h incubation. Together, these<lb/> results indicate that while the aryl sulfonamide fragment hits<lb/> did engage CAII in cells, it was with low stoichiometry and<lb/> poor selectivity over many additional off-targets.<lb/></p>

			<p>Further investigation of the off-targets revealed that some<lb/> proteins were competed in the presence of a parent, indicating<lb/> high levels of engagement; these included FABP5, PEBP1,<lb/> ABHD6, and LYPLA1 (Figure <ref type="figure">4f</ref>,g). <ref type="biblio">37</ref> ABHD6 and LYPLA1<lb/> catalyze the hydrolysis of esters and thioesters, respectively,<lb/> and have nucleophilic catalytic residues which are likely to<lb/> react with the SF moiety. <ref type="biblio">38,39</ref> Similarly, PEBP1 is a<lb/> phospholipid binder and is the prototype of a novel family<lb/> of serine protease inhibitors. <ref type="biblio">40</ref> More specifically, each of these<lb/> proteins bind molecules containing hydrophobic alkyl chains,<lb/> consistent with previous reports involving SF-containing<lb/> probes targeting FABP5 in cells. <ref type="biblio">36</ref> An alternative explanation<lb/> for these observations is the presence of a consistent benzene<lb/> SF group on each of the probes, which may be preferentially<lb/> bound by these proteins. The high levels of occupancy at these<lb/> targets suggest that they may be amenable to the development<lb/> of potent SF-based covalent inhibitors.<lb/></p>

			<p>BCL6 Follow-Up Studies: Site(s) of Binding and Hit<lb/> Expansion. The transcription factor B-cell lymphoma 6<lb/> (BCL6) has been identified as a driver of oncogenesis in<lb/> lymphoid malignancies. BCL6 is implicated in several protein-<lb/>protein interactions with corepressors, and disruption of these<lb/> interactions is currently being investigated as a strategy for<lb/> cancer treatment. <ref type="biblio">41</ref> A range of small molecules that target<lb/> BCL6 have been reported, including reversible inhibitors such<lb/> as compound 11 (GSK137) and macrocyclic compound<lb/> 12. <ref type="biblio">41,42</ref> Compounds with alternative mechanisms have also<lb/> been reported, including degraders such as compound 13 (BI-<lb/>3802) and more recently rationally designed covalent inhibitor<lb/> 14 (TMX-2164) that targets Tyr57 (Figure <ref type="figure">5a,b</ref>). <ref type="biblio">43,44<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>The top hits from the SF screen with BCL6 represented two<lb/> distinct chemotypes: meta-substituted benzamides (2f and 2g)<lb/> and azetidine aryl ethers (2h and 2i). These were<lb/> resynthesized and purified for follow-up studies. Tandem MS<lb/> was used to identify the amino acid residue(s) responsible for<lb/> covalent modification, and interestingly, the two different<lb/> chemotypes were found to target two different residues (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">5c,d</ref>). The results showed that meta-substituted benzamides 2f<lb/> (373 Da) and 2g (344 Da) modified Tyr57 on the peptide<lb/> 47 TVLMACSGLFY*SIFTDQLKR 66 , and azetidine aryl ethers<lb/> 2h (365 Da) and 2i (372 Da) modified His115 on the peptide<lb/> 98 EGNIMAVMATAMYLQMEH*VVDTCR 121 (see Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">S12</ref>). Tyr57 has previously been targeted by a BCL6 inhibitor<lb/> (14, TMX-2164); however, the targeting of His115 is a novel<lb/> modification; these residues are located on opposite sides of<lb/> the binding site of previously reported BCL6 inhibitors <ref type="biblio">(11-<lb/>14)</ref> (see Figure <ref type="figure">5b</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>An iterative screen was subsequently carried out with the<lb/> intention of expanding the pool of hit compounds and<lb/> identifying BCL6 hits with higher covalent modification yields.<lb/> For this, a new 352-membered library of SF-based reactive<lb/> fragments was designed based on a similarity search of<lb/> available amine-functionalized fragments using the top four<lb/> original hits (2f-i). The library was generated by HTC,<lb/> incubated with BCL6 in a D2B fashion, and subsequently<lb/></p>

			<p>analyzed by intact protein LC-MS. The extent of covalent<lb/> modifications observed for this screen was markedly higher,<lb/> with many further hits discovered (2m-t). This included five<lb/> reactive fragments which gave covalent modification yields<lb/> greater than the maximum modification yields observed in the<lb/> original screen and three hits with over 50% modification<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">5e,f</ref>). The meta-substituted benzamides gave the<lb/> higher modification yields, and several different groups in the<lb/> meta position were well-tolerated. Other hits showed that<lb/> different N-containing saturated heterocycles with alternative<lb/> heteroatom links to aryl groups were also tolerated by the<lb/> binding pocket.<lb/></p>

			<p>Structural and Biophysical Investigations into BCL6<lb/> Hits. With additional hits identified from the iterative screen,<lb/> we sought to obtain further structural and biophysical<lb/> information to better understand how these reactive fragments<lb/> bind to BCL6. A total of eight SF hits were resynthesized and<lb/> purified: the four from the original screen (2f-i) and four from<lb/> the iterative screen (2p, 2q, 2s, and 2t). To confirm that these<lb/> eight hits targeted the same binding site as previously reported<lb/> binders, GSK137 (biochemical pIC 50 = 8) was used as a<lb/> known inhibitor for a displacement experiment. <ref type="biblio">42</ref> The SFs<lb/> (100 μM) were incubated for 24 h with BCL6 in the presence<lb/> of GSK137 (100 μM) or DMSO as a control, and the samples<lb/> were analyzed by intact protein LC-MS. The resultant mass<lb/> spectra showed that covalent modification was attenuated by<lb/> 78-96% for all eight SFs, indicating that all hits were<lb/> competing for the same site (Figure <ref type="figure">6a</ref>). <ref type="biblio">42<lb/></ref> </p>
			
			<p>We subsequently analyzed protein-fragment interactions<lb/> using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to explore the<lb/> impact of these binding events on protein stability. <ref type="biblio">45</ref> The<lb/> azetidinyl/piperidinyl fragments exhibited negligible thermal<lb/> shifts (see Figure <ref type="figure">S13b,c</ref>); however, the meta-substituted<lb/> benzamide complexes were highly thermally stabilized (ΔT m ∼<lb/> 7 °C) relative to unmodified BCL6, which implied the<lb/> presence of intermolecular interactions from ligand binding<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">6b</ref>). This level of stabilization was comparable to that<lb/> observed for the potent, noncovalent inhibitor GSK137 (ΔT m<lb/> ∼ 12 °C, see Figure <ref type="figure">S13d</ref>). <ref type="biblio">42</ref> Kinetic analyses of the four hits<lb/> from the original screen (2f-i) revealed that for the meta-<lb/>substituted benzamides, the reversible affinities of these<lb/> fragments were relatively weak, with K I = 56 and 80 μM for<lb/> 2f and 2g, respectively (see Figure <ref type="figure">S14</ref>). Therefore, it was<lb/> interesting to observe a thermal shift similar to an inhibitor<lb/> with biochemical pIC50 = 8; this illustrates the impact of<lb/> covalent modification on protein-ligand binding.<lb/></p>

			<p>Crystal structures of SFs 2f and 2s within BCL6 were<lb/> generated to further investigate the binding mode of the<lb/> fragments; this used a previously published protocol. <ref type="biblio">42<lb/></ref> Cocrystal structures of 2f and 2s with BCL6 (solved to 1.6<lb/> and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively) revealed Tyr57 covalently<lb/> conjugated to the fragments via a sulfonate ester, consistent<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 6. Investigations of BCL6 hits provide further structural insights into binding modes of hit SFs. (a) Incubation of GSK137 with BCL6<lb/> abolishes covalent modification by meta-substituted benzamide and azetidinyl/piperidinyl SF fragments. (b) Covalent modification by the meta-<lb/>substituted benzamide hits increases the stability of BCL6 in the conventional DSF assay. Each point represents an average of three replicates. (c)<lb/> Cocrystal structure of SF 2f with the BCL6 BTB/POZ dimer. One monomer is shown in gray; one monomer is shown in pink. Compound 2f is<lb/> shown in stick representation with carbon atoms colored purple. (d) Cocrystal structure of SF 2s with the BCL6 BTB/POZ dimer. One monomer<lb/> is shown in gray; one monomer is shown in pink. Compound 2s is shown in stick representation with carbon atoms colored green. (e) Overlaid<lb/> crystal structures of 2f and 2s showing the aryl group of respective benzamides sharing a common binding surface. Tyr57 residue is omitted for<lb/> clarity.

(f) Overlaid crystal<lb/> structures of GSK137 (PDB: 7BDE) and 2s which have overlapping binding sites in the final crystallographic state.

			<p>with tandem MS studies for SF 2f (Figure <ref type="figure">6c,d</ref>). The residue<lb/> Arg27 was observed to be in close proximity to the sulfonyl<lb/> groups of 2f and 2s which may have catalyzed the covalent<lb/> modification of Tyr57 via hydrogen-bonding interactions.<lb/> While the meta-substitutions of the benzamides showed<lb/> opposite trajectories, a common binding surface of the<lb/> benzamide aryl ring was observed, suggesting that a<lb/> trisubstituted aryl group might be tolerated here (Figure <ref type="figure">6e</ref>).<lb/> The twisted conformation of 2s could also represent a<lb/> premodified state of the protein-SF complex, which may<lb/> have become disrupted for 2f upon covalent modification with<lb/> Tyr57 to afford the extended conformation observed. The<lb/> structures of GSK137 and 2s were overlaid, revealing that the<lb/> two binding sites had significant overlap in the final<lb/> crystallographic state (Figure <ref type="figure">6f</ref>). This suggested that 2s may<lb/> have similar inhibitory action to GSK137 on the BCL6 BTB/<lb/> POZ domain. <ref type="biblio">42<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<head>■ CONCLUSIONS<lb/> </head>
				
			<p>Covalent inhibitors are of high interest in chemical biology and<lb/> drug discovery for expansion of the liganded proteome and for<lb/> liganding challenging therapeutic targets. <ref type="biblio">46</ref> The majority of<lb/> efforts to develop covalent inhibitors have focused on the<lb/> targeting of cysteine residues in the vicinity of protein pockets.<lb/> However, to tackle the increasing number of genetically<lb/> validated targets that drug discovery teams are presented with,<lb/> approaches to covalent ligand discovery without reliance on<lb/> cysteine are highly sought after. SFs offer the opportunity to<lb/> target a broad repertoire of nucleophilic amino acids and hence<lb/> are effective reactive moieties to consider for &quot;beyond-<lb/>cysteine&quot; covalent inhibitors. To date, SF-containing chemical<lb/> probes have been rationally designed based on structure-<lb/>guided approaches; this typically entails the installation of an<lb/> SF group onto a potent reversible scaffold. <ref type="biblio">47</ref> Here, we have<lb/> demonstrated that sulfonyl fluoride-reactive fragments offer an<lb/> expedient approach to identify novel &quot;beyond-cysteine&quot;<lb/> covalent ligands.<lb/></p>

			<p>Screening a modest library of 352 fragments afforded hits for<lb/> two of the three proteins assessed, which were found to<lb/> interact with functionally relevant pockets. An advantage of<lb/> screening with reactive fragments over classical reversible<lb/> fragments is the facile identification of the site(s) of covalent<lb/> modification using tandem MS. Hits identified here were found<lb/> to modify tyrosine and histidine residues. The observation of<lb/> histidine modification under the denaturing MS workflows was<lb/> perhaps surprising since previous reports have suggested that<lb/> histidine adducts of SFs can be unstable. The multiple<lb/> examples of histidine modification provide evidence that this<lb/> is not always the case and that SFs are suitable electrophiles for<lb/> targeting histidine residues. <ref type="biblio">10,19,48,49<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>Kinetic analyses of the CAII hits provided a measure of<lb/> covalent modification efficiencies and parameters k inact and K I .<lb/> Interestingly, the CAII original hits exhibited good non-<lb/>covalent affinity (K I ) but slow rates of covalent modification<lb/> (k inact ). This suggested either low nucleophilicity of the<lb/> histidine residue or suboptimal geometry for covalent<lb/> modification. An HTC-D2B screen of analogues close to the<lb/> original hits identified fragments that gave fast rates of<lb/> modification (&gt;70% covalent modification in &lt;1 h), high-<lb/>lighting the potential roles of electrophile position and<lb/> reactivity in the design of covalent inhibitors and the utility<lb/> of the HTC-D2B approach as a means to optimize both k inact<lb/> and K I .<lb/></p>

			<p>The chemoproteomic analyses of the CAII hits revealed that<lb/> they engaged CAII in cells, however, at low stoichiometry,<lb/> likely due to the low k inact rates for these hits. The two CAII<lb/> hits and the negative control were also found to interact with<lb/> many additional proteins in cells (&gt;100), many of which were<lb/> common to all three SF compounds. This highlighted that<lb/> specificity is likely to be a key challenge to overcome when<lb/> developing SF-based inhibitors. Previous work in our group<lb/> has demonstrated that the reactivity of the SF electrophile is<lb/> highly tunable. <ref type="biblio">14</ref> Therefore, it is anticipated that selective<lb/> target engagement in cells would be achievable through<lb/> reduction of the intrinsic reactivity of the SF while optimizing<lb/> k inact and K I for the target. The HTC-D2B approach described<lb/> here provides a useful strategy for performing this<lb/> optimization.<lb/></p>

			<p>The SF fragment screen also identified novel hits for BCL6,<lb/> a therapeutic target under investigation for conditions such as<lb/> blood, breast, and lung cancers. <ref type="biblio">42</ref> Interestingly, the screen<lb/> afforded two hit series that were found to covalently modify<lb/> residues on opposite sides of the same pocket, one to a<lb/> tyrosine and one to a histidine, highlighting the versatility of<lb/> the approach in targeting nucleophilic amino acid residues<lb/> within a binding pocket. In this case, the pool of hit<lb/> compounds was rapidly expanded upon by an iterative screen,<lb/> and the hits represented two novel chemotypes for BCL6. The<lb/> attenuation of covalent modification when incubated in the<lb/> presence of GSK137, a published BCL6 inhibitor, implied that<lb/> the fragments target a known small-molecule binding surface. <ref type="biblio">42<lb/></ref> Cocrystal structures of BCL6 with hit SFs were obtained,<lb/> which confirmed that the binding conformations overlapped<lb/> with that of GSK137, positing the fragment as a covalent probe<lb/> to aid the discovery of novel inhibitors of the BCL6 BTB/POZ<lb/> domain.<lb/></p>

			<p>Collectively, these results demonstrate that SF-reactive<lb/> fragment screening offers an efficient approach for the<lb/> discovery of &quot;beyond-cysteine&quot; covalent ligands. The HTC-<lb/>D2B approach enables rapid iterative design-make-test cycles<lb/> to drive toward more potent and selective chemical tools. This<lb/> HTC-D2B workflow facilitates the exploration of alternative<lb/> SF groups as the reactive moiety, which can be exploited to<lb/> reduce the intrinsic reactivity, and thus promiscuity, of the<lb/> fragments while simultaneously optimizing k inact and K I for the<lb/> target of interest. This will support the development of<lb/> covalent chemical probes to expand the liganded proteome and<lb/> ultimately further our understanding of disease biology.<lb/></p>

			<head>■ METHODS<lb/></head>

			<p>Full experimental details including synthesis and data processing are<lb/> provided in the Supporting Information.<lb/></p>

			<p>HTC-D2B Protocol. To a 384-well plate containing 352 amine-<lb/>functionalized fragments (10 mM) in DMSO (5 μL per well) was<lb/> added a stock solution of OSu 2a (10 mM) and NEM (30 mM) in<lb/> DMSO (5 μL per well). The plate was sealed, centrifuged (1 min,<lb/> 1000 rpm), and allowed to sit at room temperature for 1 h. After the<lb/> reaction (assumed product concentration: 5 mM), the library of SFs<lb/> to a Greiner 384 was echo dispensed into a low volume plate. Purified<lb/> protein (see the Supporting Information for concentration) was<lb/> subsequently added across the plate. The plate was sealed,<lb/> centrifuged, incubated for 24 h, and then analyzed by intact protein<lb/> LC-MS.<lb/></p>

			<p>Identification of the Site of Modification. The (resynthesized<lb/> and purified) SF hits (2d and 2e, 10 mM) were plated into a 384-well<lb/> plate. Purified CAII was subsequently added across the plate. Final<lb/> concentrations: 2 μM protein; 50 μM SF. The plate was sealed,<lb/> centrifuged, and incubated at 20 °C for 24 h, and 15 μL aliquots were<lb/> subsequently removed and analyzed by intact protein LC-MS. The<lb/> remaining samples (1 μg) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-<lb/>polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to remove excess unbound<lb/> compounds. Gels were stained with colloidal Comassie InstantBlue,<lb/> and bands corresponding to CAII were excised, reduced with TCEP<lb/> (10 mM, 65 °C, 30 min), and alkylated with iodoacetamide (10 mM,<lb/> rt, 30 min, dark). Samples were digested with trypsin (1:10 E/S, 37<lb/> °C, 16 h) in ammonium bicarbonate (100 mM). After removal of the<lb/> supernatant, peptides were extracted using acetonitrile. Combined<lb/> supernatants were centrifuged and acidified prior to injection into the<lb/> LC-MS/MS system. Tandem MS spectra were searched for peptide<lb/> matches against the sequence for CAII. Raw files were searched using<lb/> trypsin as the enzyme. Masses corresponding to [SF -HF] were<lb/> allowed as variable modification(s) on cysteine, histidine, lysine,<lb/> tyrosine, serine, and threonine as well as the protein N-terminus. MS/<lb/> MS spectra were manually validated and annotated.<lb/></p>

			<p>Kinetic Analyses. The (resynthesized and purified) SF hits (2b-<lb/>e, 10 mM) were plated into seven 384-well plates with DMSO to<lb/> make up identical plates with final concentrations of 100, 50, 20, 10,<lb/> or 5 μM after adding 15 μL of protein stock solution per well. The<lb/> percentage of DMSO was kept constant. Purified CAII was<lb/> subsequently added across all plates. Final concentrations were 0.5<lb/> μM protein; 100, 50, 20, 10, or 5 μM SF. The plates were sealed and<lb/> centrifuged, and the first six plates were immediately queued for<lb/> analysis by intact protein LC-MS at a temperature of 20 °C with the<lb/> final plate paused for a 24 h timepoint.</p>
