			<p>Since their identification in the mid eighties <ref type="biblio">[56]</ref> and their sub-<lb/>sequent cloning <ref type="biblio">[18,31]</ref> in the early nineties, the metabotropic glu-<lb/>tamate receptor (mGluR) family triggered an intensive search to-<lb/>ward the identification of pharmacological agents to determine the<lb/> role of the mGlu receptors in the nervous system physiology and<lb/> patho-physiology. To date eight of such receptors (mGlu1-8) have<lb/> been cloned and based on their amino-acids sequence, pharmacol-<lb/>ogy and second messenger coupling these receptors have been clus-<lb/>tered into three groups (I -III) <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. mGlu receptors belong to the<lb/> family 3 GPCRs and as such have a large extracellular ligand rec-<lb/>ognition N-terminal domain and seven transmembrane-spanning<lb/> regions that are connected by three intra-cellular and three extracel-<lb/>lular loops with a number of conserved cysteine residues <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. The<lb/> extracellular ligand recognition N-terminal domain has a so-called<lb/> bi-lobed structure (= Venus fly-trap function) that can adopt an<lb/> open or closed configuration in the absence or presence of an ago-<lb/>nist, respectively <ref type="biblio">[41]</ref>. In addition, there are indications that in the<lb/> brain functional mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors may predominantly<lb/> exist as homodimers <ref type="biblio">[52]</ref>. Glutamate is the physiological agonist<lb/> for all mGlu receptors subtypes and as such the first selective<lb/> agents identified were glutamate analogs <ref type="biblio">[54]</ref> and are acting at the<lb/> receptor by displacing Glutamate from its binding site located in the<lb/> N-terminal domain, the orthosteric site. As such those ligands are<lb/> named competitive agonists or antagonists. The structural analogy<lb/> to Glutamate, with the presence of a distal carboxylic acid to the<lb/> amino-acid functionality, strongly influence the properties of the<lb/> competitive ligands and limits considerably their capacity to cross<lb/> membranes by passive diffusion. As a consequence, these com-<lb/>pounds have a poor oral bioavailability, and do not readily cross the<lb/> blood-brain-barrier. A noticeable exception is illustrated by the<lb/> small molecular weight ligands, LY354740, LY379268 or<lb/> LY404039 <ref type="biblio">[53]</ref> which display potent agonist activity at mGlu2/3<lb/> receptors, are orally bioavailable, and enter the brain in preclinical<lb/> model <ref type="biblio">[36,37]</ref> and have been developed throughout the clinic as<lb/> potential anti-panic agents <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The difficulty to identify suitable glutamate analog with ade-<lb/>quate drug-like properties and subtype selectivity has been an im-<lb/>portant element that fostered the search for alternative structural<lb/> compound classes to inhibit or activate mGlu receptor function.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCOVERY<lb/></head>

			<p>The identification of the allosteric modulators is intimately<lb/> linked with the development of in vitro assays allowing the charac-<lb/>terization of the functional activity of agents acting at the receptor.<lb/> For the Group I mGlu receptors, coupled to Gq type of G-proteins,<lb/> two cellular assays based on IP 3 turnover and measurements of<lb/> intracellular Ca 2+ concentration were developed (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>For the Group II and III mGlu receptors, which are coupled to<lb/> Gi type of G-proteins, functional assays involving GTP--35 S bind-<lb/>ing and determination of cAMP concentration changes were devel-<lb/>oped (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The development of these functional assays and their adaptation<lb/> to a high throughput screening mode allowed the screening of large<lb/> chemical libraries and the identification of numerous ligands with<lb/> no structural analogies to the natural ligand Glutamate acting as<lb/> negative allosteric modulators (NAM) or as positive allosteric<lb/> modulators (PAM).<lb/></p>

			<p>A number of excellent reviews describing in the mechanism of<lb/> action and the progresses in the allosteric modulator field have been<lb/> published <ref type="biblio">[13,14,20,44,45,50,55]</ref>. Here, we would like to describe<lb/> the most recent developments in the identification and characteriza-<lb/>tion of allosteric ligands for the various mGluR subtypes.<lb/></p>

			<head>GROUP I<lb/> </head>
			<head>mGluR1 NAM<lb/></head>

			<p>CPCCOEt (1) was the first non glutamate antagonist described<lb/> for the mGlu1 receptor <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. This agent has been a useful tool to<lb/> investigate the role of the mGluR1 subtype in vitro, however, its<lb/> limited potency (only low micromolar IC 50 ), its lack of bio-<lb/>availability and brain penetration did not allow a broad use in vivo.<lb/> Nevertheless, CPCCOEt was identified as non-competitive inhibitor<lb/> and allowed to unravel and characterize the allosteric binding site<lb/> located in the transmembrane domain <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>. A more potent com-<lb/>pound, BAY36-7620 (2) was subsequently described to interact at<lb/> the same allosteric binding site and to inhibit the receptor constitu-<lb/>tive activity <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. The improved in vivo properties of BAY36-7620<lb/> has allowed the detection of an early signal for analgesic and anti-<lb/>convulsant effect but also for an impaired acquisition of a spatial<lb/> memory task (Morris water maze) <ref type="biblio">[9,58]</ref>. This effect on memory<lb/> was later confirmed with highly optimized compounds. However,<lb/> various issues including potency has limited an extensive charac-<lb/>terization using this compound for the use of exploring the potential<lb/> of mGlu1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of various CNS<lb/> disorders. The first described highly potent, selective and systemi-<lb/>cally active mGlu1 receptor antagonist is JNJ16259685 (3) <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>.<lb/> JNJ16259685 is a non competitive antagonist with IC 50 values of<lb/> 3.2 and 1.2 nM in glutamate-induced calcium mobilization at rat<lb/> and human receptors, respectively. In addition, systemic application<lb/> of JNJ16259685 resulted in high receptor occupancy at low dosis.<lb/> Together these data provide evidence that JNJ16259685 is an excel-<lb/>lent tool to explore the potential of mGlu1 receptor antagonists as<lb/> therapeutics <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>. Steckler et al. <ref type="biblio">[60]</ref> described anxiolytic-like<lb/> properties in punished licking behavior which appeared to have<lb/> synergistic effects with mGlu5 receptor antagonists. Nevertheless,<lb/> the effects seem different from those for mGlu5 receptor antago-<lb/>nists as prominent effects were only seen on conflict procedures but<lb/> not on task based spontaneous exploration. Effects were described<lb/> on locomotor activity as expected from the expression pattern in<lb/> cerebellar structures but following chronic application data suggest<lb/> tolerance to these motor disturbances. Subsequently, Steckler et al.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[61]</ref> described that JNJ16259685 impaired spatial acquisition proc-<lb/>esses, irrespective of spatial load, as well as spatial re-acquisition,<lb/> already at the lowest dose tested (0.63 mg/kg). Effects on spatial<lb/> retention performance were relatively mild in mice that had learned<lb/> to locate the position of the escape platform prior to treatment.<lb/> These data suggest that blockade of the mGlu1 receptor primarily<lb/> affects learning of new information, but leaves retention of spatial<lb/> information relatively unaffected.<lb/></p>

			<p>Another potent and selective non-competitive mGlu1 antagonist<lb/> is A-841720 (4) <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. At recombinant human and native rat<lb/> mGluR1 receptors, A-841720 inhibited agonist-induced calcium<lb/> mobilization, with IC 50 values of 10.7 and 1.0 nM, respectively,<lb/> while showing selectivity over other mGluR receptors. Intraperito-<lb/>neal injection of A-841720 potently reduced complete Freund&apos;s<lb/> adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain (ED 50 = 8 mg/kg) and mon-<lb/>oiodoacetate-induced joint pain (ED 50 = 15 mg/kg). A-841720 also<lb/> decreased mechanical allodynia observed in both the sciatic nerve<lb/> chronic constriction injury and L5-L6 spinal nerve ligation (SNL)<lb/> models of neuropathic pain (ED 50 = 10 and 9 mg/kg, respectively).<lb/> Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that systemic administra-<lb/>tion of A-841720 in SNL animals significantly reduced evoked<lb/> firing in spinal wide dynamic range neurons. Importantly, signifi-<lb/>cant motor side effects were observed at analgesic doses and A-<lb/>841720 also impaired cognitive function in the Y-maze and the<lb/> Water Maze tests with no therapeutic index. The analgesic effects<lb/> of a selective mGluR1 receptor antagonist are associated with mo-<lb/>tor and cognitive side effects.<lb/></p>

			<p>Taken together, the lack of separation between efficacy and side<lb/> effects in pre-clinical models indicates that mGluR1 antagonism<lb/> may not provide an adequate therapeutic window for the develop-<lb/>ment of such antagonists as therapeutics in humans.<lb/></p>

			<head>mGluR1 PAM<lb/></head>

			<p>Knoflach et al. <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref> were the first to describe two chemical<lb/> series, compounds 5, 6 and 7 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), capable to potently increase<lb/> agonist-mediated responses in cells expressing the rat mGlu1 recep-<lb/>tor and in rat brain tissues. All three compounds were shown to<lb/> enhance the binding affinity of agonists for the orthosteric site. In<lb/> cells recombinantely expressing high level of the receptor and in<lb/> which the receptor shows a significant level of constitutive activity,<lb/> all three compounds were found to elicit a response in the absence<lb/> of orthosteric agonist. No similar effect was seen in native systems.<lb/> From the mechanistically point of view these effects were explained<lb/> by an interaction of the compound with an active form of the recep-<lb/>tor and the stabilization thereof. Compounds 5 and 7, showed selec-<lb/>tivity over the rmGlu2, rmGlu4, rmGlu5, rmGlu8 and hGABA B<lb/> receptors whereas compound 6 displayed a weak activation of the<lb/> glutamate-induced activation at the rmGlu5 receptor. Interestingly,<lb/> when tested on the human mGlu1 receptor only compound 6 acted<lb/> as positive modulator, compounds 5 and 7 being devoid of activity.<lb/> Furthermore, using chimeric receptor constructs and site directed<lb/> mutagenesis, Knoflach et al. <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>, could demonstrate that all three<lb/> compounds interact in the transmembrane domain in an overlapping<lb/> pocket compared to the mGluR1 NAMS. Recently, a series of<lb/> structurally different mGlu1 positive modulators obtained by<lb/> chemical derivatization of the mGluR5 PAM CDPPB (15, Fig.<ref type="figure">3</ref>)<lb/> </p>

			<p>was described and characterized. In contrast to the compounds 5, 7<lb/> and 8, the CDPPB series was shown to interact in the transmem-<lb/>brane domain with a different binding mode compared to the<lb/> mGluR1 allosteric negative modulators <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>So far, no in vivo activity has been reported on the effects of<lb/> mGlu1 receptor PAMs, but based on the negative effects of NAMs<lb/> on learning and memory <ref type="biblio">[10,61]</ref> it can be hypothesized that en-<lb/>hancement of mGlu1 receptor activity through a selective PAM<lb/> could be beneficial to restore normal learning and memory proc-<lb/>esses.<lb/></p>

			<head>mGluR5 NAM<lb/></head>

			<p>2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), 8 is the proto-<lb/>typical allosteric mGlu5 receptor antagonist <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. It is a potent,<lb/> selective and systemically active antagonist. At the human mGlu5a<lb/> receptor expressed in recombinant cells, MPEP completely inhibits<lb/> quisqualate-stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis with an<lb/> IC 50 value of 36 nM while having no agonist or antagonist activities<lb/> at other receptors up to 30 M. Schild&apos;s analysis indicated that<lb/> MPEP acts in a non-competitive manner. MPEP also inhibited to a<lb/> large extent constitutive receptor activity in cells transiently over-<lb/>expressing rat mGluR5, suggesting that MPEP may act as an in-<lb/>verse agonist <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Using chimeras and single amino acid substitutions between<lb/> hmGluR1 and hmGluR5, binding of the mGluR5 radioligand [ 3 H]-<lb/>2-methyl-6-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethynyl pyridine (M-MPEP) it could<lb/> be determined that the amino acids Ala-810 (TMVII), Pro-655 and<lb/> Ser-658 (TMIII) of the mGlu5 receptor are necessary to mediate the<lb/> binding and the selectivity of the MPEP series of antagonists. Con-<lb/>versely, the introduction of these three amino-acids in the corre-<lb/>sponding reciprocal position of the hmGlu1 receptor led to a mutant<lb/> mGlu1 receptor capable to bind [ 3 H]-M-MPEP with low nanomolar<lb/> affinity <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>. Radioligand binding to these mutants was also inhib-<lb/>ited by 7-hydroxyiminocyclopropan [b]chromen-1a-carboxylic acid<lb/> ethyl ester (CPCCOEt), a structurally unrelated non-competitive<lb/> mGluR1 antagonist previously shown to interact within the TM<lb/> region of the mGlu1 receptor <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>. These results indicate that MPEP<lb/> and CPCCOEt bind to overlapping binding pockets in the TM re-<lb/>gion of group I mGluRs but interact with different non-conserved<lb/> residues. Several additional allosteric mGlu5 antagonists based on<lb/> the chemical structure of MPEP have been described and character-<lb/>ized, among those MTEP 9 a close derivative was also extensively<lb/> characterized <ref type="biblio">[5,57]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The identification of MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-<lb/>pyridine allowed the exploration of the therapeutic potential of this<lb/> class of compounds. Subsequent behavior studies revealed that--<lb/>with the exception of benzodiazepines--mGlu5 receptor antagonists<lb/> exhibit the widest and most robust anxiolytic activity in preclinical<lb/> models seen to date <ref type="biblio">[59]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fenobam<lb/> </head>
			
			<p>Fenobam [N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N&apos;-(4,5-dihydro-1-methyl-4-oxo-<lb/>1H-imidazole-2-yl)urea] (10) is an atypical anxiolytic agent, with<lb/> until recently an unknown molecular target, that has previously<lb/> been demonstrated both in rodents and human to exert robust anx-<lb/>iolytic-like activity. During a HTS screen at F. Hoffmann-La<lb/> Roche, Fenobam (McN-3377) was identified as a potent antagonist<lb/> at mGlu5 receptors <ref type="biblio">[49]</ref>. Characterization revealed that Fenobam is<lb/> a selective and potent metabotropic glutamate mGlu5 receptor an-<lb/>tagonist acting at an allosteric modulatory site shared with 2-<lb/>methyl-6-phenylethynyl-pyridine (MPEP). Fenobam inhibited quis-<lb/>qualate-evoked intracellular calcium response mediated by human<lb/> mGlu5 receptor with IC 50 = 58 nM. It acted in a noncompetitive<lb/> manner, similar to MPEP and demonstrated inverse agonist proper-<lb/>ties, blocking 66% of the mGlu5 receptor basal activity (in an over<lb/> expressed cell line) with an IC 50 = 84 nM. [ 3 H]-Fenobam bound to<lb/> rat and human recombinant receptors with K d values of 54 and 31<lb/> </p>

			<p>nM, respectively. MPEP inhibited [ 3 H]-fenobam binding to human<lb/> mGlu5 receptors with a Ki value of 6.7 nM, indicating a common<lb/> binding site shared by both allosteric antagonists. Fenobam exhibits<lb/> robust anxiolytic-like activity with efficacy comparable to MPEP in<lb/> the stress-induced hyperthermia model, Vogel conflict test, Geller-<lb/>Seifter conflict test, and conditioned emotional response with a<lb/> minimum effective dose of 10 to 30 mg/kg p.o. Furthermore, Feno-<lb/>bam is devoid of GABAergic activity, confirming previous reports<lb/> that Fenobam acts by a mechanism distinct from benzodiazepines.<lb/> The non-GABAergic activity of Fenobam, coupled with its robust<lb/> anxiolytic activity supports the potential of developing mGlu5 re-<lb/>ceptor antagonists with an improved therapeutic window over ben-<lb/>zodiazepines as novel anxiolytic agents. The confidence in mGlu5<lb/> receptor antagonists as a treatment for anxiety is obviously strongly<lb/> supported by positive results in clinical trials with patients. There<lb/> are at least two positive trials that indicate that Fenobam is indeed<lb/> efficacious in man including a double blind placebo-controlled and<lb/> standardized (Diazepam) trial <ref type="biblio">[42,43]</ref>. It was concluded from these<lb/> studies that Fenobam relieved symptoms of anxiety in broad spec-<lb/>trum psychoneurotic patients which may experience anxiety as<lb/> cognitive, dysphoric or motor autonomic. The anxiolytic activity is<lb/> differentiated from benzodiazepines and fenobam was safe and<lb/> induced less sedation and drowsiness. Clearly, these findings need<lb/> to be confirmed in upcoming clinical trials using highly optimized<lb/> mGlu5 receptor antagonists but provide great promise for future<lb/> studies.<lb/></p>

			<head>mGluR5 PAM<lb/></head>

			<p>In contrast to the high number of NAM for the mGlu5 receptor,<lb/> relatively few positive allosteric modulators have been described.<lb/> The first series of compounds is based on a benzaldazine core struc-<lb/>ture and the pharmacological activity is determined by the nature<lb/> and the position of the substituents <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>. In this series, DFB (3,3&apos;-<lb/>difluorobenzaldazine, 11, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), acts as positive modulator and<lb/> induces a marked increase in glutamate potency (EC 50 ). Interest-<lb/>ingly, a change in the nature of the substituent with a replacement<lb/> of the two fluorine atoms by a methoxy group conferred an antago-<lb/>nistic activity to the resulting DMeOB (3,3&apos;-dimethoxyBenzaldazine,<lb/> 12, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) derivative. Another very subtle substitution change,<lb/> chlorine for the fluorine atoms, led to the identification of a ligand<lb/> with no functional activity at the receptor, DCB (3,3&apos;-dichloro-<lb/>benzaldazine, 13, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The DFB family of modulators is the first<lb/> to demonstrate the whole range of pharmacological activities from<lb/> activation to inactivation of the receptor as well as neutral/silent<lb/> receptor ligands. All active derivatives of this series are interacting<lb/> in the transmembrane domain in a similar but not identical binding<lb/> site to the mGluR5 NAMs of the MPEP structural family. Shortly<lb/> after, two novel, structurally unrelated series illustrated by the pro-<lb/>totypic compounds CPPHA (14) and CDPPB (15) were described<lb/> by the same research group <ref type="biblio">[27,39]</ref>. Both compounds showed a<lb/> potent increase of agonist mediated receptor activation for both<lb/> human and rat receptors with no cross reactivity at the other mGluR<lb/> subtypes nor at other CNS receptors. No activation of the receptor<lb/> was seen when DFB or CPPHA were used in the absence of orthos-<lb/>teric agonist <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref> whereas CDPPB alone was capable to induce<lb/> a receptor activation <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. All three compounds had no effect on<lb/> the binding of the orthosteric ligand [ 3 H]-quisqualate <ref type="biblio">[22,39]<lb/></ref> whereas only DFB and CDPPB did inhibit the binding of [ 3 H]-<lb/>methoxy-PEP-y <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref> a derivative of the allosteric negative modulator<lb/> MPEP. Despite intense medicinal chemistry efforts, neither the<lb/> DFB nor CPPHA series did not deliver suitable molecules for in<lb/> vivo evaluation in preclinical models. In contrast, derivatization of<lb/> the CDPPB series not only allowed the identification more potent<lb/> derivatives but also the identification of mGluR1 positive allosteric<lb/> modulators <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In vivo, CDPPB was evaluated in two behavioral models sensi-<lb/>tive to antipsychotic: the amphetamine-induced locomotor activity<lb/> and the amphetamine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition<lb/> (PPI) in rat. In both models, CDPPB showed a dose dependent<lb/> beneficial effect without noticeable side-effects <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>. These results<lb/> demonstrated for the first time the in vivo activity of a selective<lb/> mGluR5 allosteric positive modulator and suggested a potential use<lb/> of these type of modulator as anti-psychotics.<lb/></p>

			<head>GROUP II<lb/> </head>
				
			<head>mGluR2 NAM<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the publication of two series of mGluR2 NAMs by Kol-<lb/>czewski et al. <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref> and Wichmann et al. <ref type="biblio">[63]</ref> no further develop-<lb/>ment nor structurally novel mGluR2 NAMs have been described to<lb/> date. These two series illustrated by the compounds 16 and 17 (Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">4</ref>) were shown to inhibit agonist stimulated GTP--[ 35 S] binding on<lb/> a rat mGluR2 transfected cell membranes with sub-micromolar<lb/> IC 50 . Both lead compounds were also shown to be selective over<lb/> mGluR1, mGluR4, mGluR5 and ionotropic GluRs but no data was<lb/> published for the selectivity over the mGluR3 or other CNS recep-<lb/>tors. Based on the effects achieved with orthosteric antagonists, it<lb/> could be speculated that mGluR2 NAMs could improve cognitive<lb/> and or memory disturbances <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>mGluR2 PAM<lb/></head>

			<p>Among all mGlu receptor subtypes, the activation of the Group<lb/> II subtypes is by far the best studied thanks to the identification and<lb/> development by Eli Lilly of the orthosteric agonist LY354740<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[36,37]</ref>. This compound and its prodrug derivative (LY544344)<lb/> have been extensively characterized in preclinical model for anxiety<lb/> related disorders and subsequently developed in the clinic where<lb/> their use demonstrate the usefulness of activation of Group II recep-<lb/>tors for the treatment of anxiety related disorders <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>. This proof of<lb/> principle with LY354740 also confirms that activation of the<lb/> mGluR2,3 subtypes display therapeutic activity at doses which are<lb/> devoid of the side effects typically observed with agents interacting<lb/> with the ionotropic glutamate receptors.<lb/></p>

			<p>The search for orthosteric ligands derived from the original<lb/> structure, LY354740, with similar pharmacological and drug-<lb/>like properties proved to be extremely difficult and prompted the<lb/> search for alternative structures. As for the Group I, the use of func-<lb/>tional assays combined with the screening of chemical libraries<lb/> allowed the identification of the first series of positive allosteric<lb/> modulators: the sulfonamide derivatives such as LY487379 (18)<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>. LY487379 and analog compounds from the same chemical<lb/> class were shown to act as allosteric modulators with an activation<lb/> of the receptor only in the presence of an orthosteric agonist and no<lb/> displacement of the orthosteric antagonist LY341495. In contrast to<lb/> all known orthosteric agonists, LY487379 and its derivatives are<lb/> selective for the mGluR2 over the other seven mGluR subtypes<lb/> including the mGluR3 and over a binding battery of CNS relevant<lb/> receptor. In vivo, LY487379 or its derivatives demonstrated effi-<lb/>cacy in animal models for anxiety (Fear potentiated startle; Stress<lb/> induced hyperthermia) or for anti-psychotic activity (PCP induced<lb/> locomotor activity) <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>. A second series of compound was de-<lb/>scribed shortly after by a research group at Merck and exemplified<lb/> by the phenyl-tetrazolyl acetophenone derivative 19 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>)<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[7,46,47,48]</ref>. In vitro, this series of compounds showed a similar<lb/> profile to the LY487379 and in vivo the use of a more potent and<lb/> brain penetrable compound, BINA (20), confirmed the potential<lb/> anti-psychotic effects in animal models <ref type="biblio">[11,15,48,51]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Taken together these results that mGluR2 selective modulators<lb/> constitute a potential alternative for a pharmacotherapeutic inter-<lb/>vention to the orthosteric non-selective mGluR2,-3 agonists.<lb/></p>

			<head>GROUP III<lb/> </head>
				
			<head>mGluR4, 6, 7, 8 NAMs<lb/></head>

			<p>Compared to the Group I and II mGluR, the pharmacology of<lb/> the Group III is the least developed with a lack of subtype selective<lb/> negative modulators. To our knowledge, only one series of com-<lb/>pounds claimed in a patent (WO02102807; EP1408042 A1) has<lb/> been described. Within this series compound 23 is described as a<lb/> selective allosteric negative modulator of the mGluR7 with an IC 50<lb/> of 7 nM.<lb/></p>

			<head>mGluR4 PAM<lb/></head>

			<p>For the mGlu4 receptor, two compounds have been identified,<lb/> PHCCC, 21 <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref> and SIB1893, 22 <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref> both originally discovered<lb/> as antagonist for the mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors, respectively.<lb/> MPEP, 8 was also identified as potentiator of the mGluR4 but at<lb/> very high concentrations (50-100 m) which are several order of<lb/> magnitude higher than the effective concentrations needed to inhibit<lb/> the mGlu5 receptor.<lb/></p>

			<p>In rat brain slices, using CPCCC Valenti et al. <ref type="biblio">[62]</ref> could dem-<lb/>onstrate that the mGlu4 receptor plays a key role in the Group III<lb/> mGluR modulation of the excitatory transmission in the substantia<lb/> nigra pars compacta (SNc), a key region involved in the nigral neu-<lb/>rodegeneration and the resulting movement disorders in Parkinson&apos;s<lb/> Disease. Unfortunately, the limiting drug-like properties of PHCCC<lb/> and the lack of more potent and selective mGluR4 PAM prevent the<lb/> validation in vivo in animal model of this putative use of mGluR4<lb/> positive modulators. Additional potential pharmacotherapeutic uses<lb/> of mGluR4 have been recently reviewed by Marino et<lb/> al. <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>As for the other members of the Group III receptors the lack of<lb/> suitable selective pharmacological tools slowed considerably the<lb/> study of the mGlu7 receptor. However, the generation and the char-<lb/>acterization of the mGluR7 knock-out mice indicated that amygdala<lb/> dependent functions such as conditioned fear, aversive responses<lb/> and responses to anxiety and stress related responses are altered<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[6,32,35]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The recent identification of a selective allosteric agonist,<lb/> AMN082 (24, Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) allowed the confirmation of the data obtained<lb/> with the mGluR7 null mice <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. In vitro, AMN082 was shown to<lb/> potently activate the recombinantly expressed human mGlu7 recep-<lb/>tor with an EC 50 of 64 nM in the absence of orthosteric agonist. In<lb/> addition, AMN082 increases the orthosteric agonist (Glu, L-AP4)<lb/> induced receptor activation in analogy to the positive modulators at<lb/> the other mGluR subtypes. In vivo, AMN082 was shown to be<lb/> orally bioavailable, to penetrate into the brain and to modulate the<lb/> level of stress hormones (cortisol and ACTH) in wild type animal<lb/> but not in the mGluR7 ko mouse. Taken together this data demon-<lb/>strate that mGluR7 modulation could a valuable mechanism for the<lb/> pharmacotherapy of stress-related psychiatric disorders.<lb/></p>

			<head>CONCLUSIONS/OUTLOOK<lb/></head>

			<p>The ubiquitous distribution of glutamate in the brain sets off the<lb/> critical role of glutamate receptors in most major functions of the<lb/> CNS. Next to the ionotropic glutamate-gated ion channels, me-<lb/>tabotropic glutamate receptors modulate neuronal excitability, syn-<lb/>aptic transmission, and have various metabolic functions. Albeit<lb/> small, the Family III or Class C of G-protein-coupled receptors<lb/> have become the focal point for the discovery of new and exciting<lb/> modulators of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Exciting medicinal<lb/> chemistry that allowed the interaction of small molecules with re-<lb/>ceptors through soft touched allosteric modulation that modify<lb/> transmembrane signaling rather than compete for binding with the<lb/> natural agonist at orthosteric sites. Indeed, the mGlu receptors are<lb/> illustrative in the discovery of both positive and/or negative allos-<lb/>teric modulators that display a unique degree of subtype selectivity<lb/> within the highly conserved mGlu family of receptors. The combi-<lb/>nation of these pharmacological tools, in conjunction with genetic<lb/> approaches, has led to major advances in our understanding of the<lb/> roles of mGlu receptors in regulating of CNS function and animal<lb/> behavior. From cloning to the identification multiple receptors, sub-<lb/>type selective allosteric modulators and testing in double blind pla-<lb/>cebo controlled trials in less than 15 years is a remarkable story.<lb/> These developments provide us with the unique opportunity for<lb/> better treatments in a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric<lb/> disorders that include complicated disease states such as depression,<lb/> anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia.<lb/></p>
