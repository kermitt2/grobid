			<p>Alzheimer&apos;s disease (AD) is associated with a progressively<lb/> neurodegenerative condition leading to dementia that mostly<lb/> affects older people. AD represents one of the &quot;protein<lb/> misfolding diseases&quot; with the highest socioeconomic impact <ref type="biblio">1<lb/></ref> and still denotes a serious threat and an important challenge<lb/> for scientific research in both the therapeutic and diagnostic<lb/> fields. The cause and progression of the disease are not yet<lb/> fully elucidated, being AD, especially the sporadic, late onset<lb/> form of the disease (LOAD), linked to genetic or environ-<lb/>mental risk factors, many of which are not still completely<lb/> clarified. <ref type="biblio">2</ref> Currently, the therapeutic treatments, available in<lb/> the market, offer only small symptomatic benefits and in part<lb/> can slow down the course of the disease. One of the<lb/> pathological hallmarks of AD is the presence of extracellular<lb/> plaques mainly composed of aggregated forms of amyloid-β<lb/> (Aβ) peptide, a 39-43 residue fragment derived from the<lb/> amyloid precursor protein (APP). <ref type="biblio">3</ref> Recent studies demonstrate<lb/> that early stage prefibrillar aggregates such as oligomers and<lb/> protofibrils are highly toxic species in the central nervous<lb/> system compared to mature fibrils. <ref type="biblio">4,5</ref> Structural information<lb/> about the toxic oligomeric Aβ species underlying AD has been<lb/> difficult to obtain at an atomic level. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> The transient and<lb/> heterogeneous properties of these assemblies imposes many<lb/> challenges for the understanding of the multiple toxic<lb/> mechanisms. Some oligomers are proposed to impart their<lb/> toxic function by interacting directly with the cell membrane of<lb/> neurons with consequent permeabilization and disruption. <ref type="biblio">7,8<lb/></ref> Thus, unveiling the structural features of oligomeric Aβ species<lb/> is turning a topical field of investigation propaedeutic for the<lb/> design of effective therapeutics that target these pathogenic Aβ<lb/> species. <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> Aβ 42 aggregates into 6-10 nm diameter fibrils with<lb/> the characteristic cross-β structure. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> Preventing Aβ 42 peptide<lb/> aggregation is therapeutically attractive, since Aβ aggregation is<lb/> an exclusively pathological process. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> Selective targeting of<lb/> Aβ&apos;s fibrillogenesis should not interfere with the physiological<lb/> function of APP as well as other proteins involved in the<lb/> production of Aβ monomers, whose physiological beneficial<lb/> role has been recently reported. <ref type="biblio">12</ref> Several small molecules,<lb/> metal chelators, carbohydrate-containing compounds, and<lb/> short peptides have been identified as inhibitors of amyloid<lb/> aggregation. <ref type="biblio">13-16</ref> In particular, the clinical evidence of an<lb/> abnormal metal ion interaction with Aβ in AD has promoted<lb/> studies aimed at developing potential therapeutic strategies by<lb/> using metal chelators or antioxidant compounds that target<lb/> aberrant metal distribution and the adverse consequences of<lb/> metal induced oxidative stress in AD. <ref type="biblio">17-19</ref> The finding that the<lb/> hydrophobic core at residues <ref type="biblio">16-20</ref> of Aβ (KLVFF) is crucial<lb/> for the formation of β-sheet structures <ref type="biblio">20</ref> has stimulated the<lb/> investigation of the KLVFF peptide as an inhibitor of Aβ 42<lb/> fibrillogenesis. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> Some papers in the past reported that the<lb/> KLVFF peptide, by binding the homologous sequence in full-<lb/>length Aβ, can prevent at aggregation into fibrils <ref type="biblio">13,22,23</ref> and this<lb/> ability is maintained after conjugation to different scaffolds<lb/> including oligolysines, <ref type="biblio">24</ref> cyclodextrins, <ref type="biblio">25</ref> dendrimers, <ref type="biblio">26</ref> or<lb/> porphyrins. <ref type="biblio">27,28<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>Therefore, conjugation has emerged as a popular mechanism<lb/> to modify or enhance the properties of a peptide drug<lb/> candidate. <ref type="biblio">29,30</ref> Conjugation can also be used to deliver a<lb/> cytotoxic payload or imaging agent to specific cell types<lb/> targeted by the peptide. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> Calix[n]arenes are macrocyclic<lb/> polyphenols proposed as molecular scaffolds for different fields<lb/> of application. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> These macrocycles due to the peculiar<lb/> structure and synthetic versatility have gained great interest<lb/> in supramolecular chemistry. The calix[4-8]arene oligomers<lb/> possess a hydrophobic cavity able to host a variety of guests<lb/> and can cluster and spatially organize multiple ligands,<lb/> providing rigid or flexible constructs suited for molecular<lb/> recognition events. The low toxicity and immunogenicity<lb/> exhibited by a variety of calix[n]arene derivatives have<lb/> advanced these macrocycles to applications in biomedical<lb/> and pharmaceutical fields. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> Calix[n]arene derivatives have<lb/> been proposed as anticancer, <ref type="biblio">34</ref> antibacterial, <ref type="biblio">35</ref> synthetic<lb/> vaccines, <ref type="biblio">36</ref> imaging agents, <ref type="biblio">37</ref> and drug <ref type="biblio">38</ref> and gene <ref type="biblio">39</ref> delivery<lb/> systems. Opportunely functionalized, the calix[n]arenes have<lb/> also been exploited as biomimetic models to better understand<lb/> relevant biological processes underlying the protein-protein or<lb/> protein-carbohydrate interactions. <ref type="biblio">40</ref> Yet, calix[n]arenes have<lb/> been successfully used as novel compounds for protein<lb/> detection <ref type="biblio">40</ref> and protein modulation. <ref type="biblio">41</ref> However, despite the<lb/> wide use of calix[n]arenes in several fields of application, very<lb/> few papers have dealt with the interactions of calix[n]arene<lb/> derivatives with Aβ. Wang et al. described p-sulfonate-<lb/>calix[4,6,8]arenes with anti-and disaggregating effect on<lb/> Aβ 42 through nonspecific hydrophobic interactions. <ref type="biblio">42</ref> Guo et<lb/> al. synthesized a nanoassembly consisting of multiple units of a<lb/> p-sulfonate calix[4]arene and a β-cyclodextrin, which by means<lb/> of the multiple complexing cavities exposed on the nano-<lb/>assembly surface bind Aβ 42 , inhibiting its aggregation or<lb/> inducing fibril disaggregation. <ref type="biblio">43</ref> We determined that endowing<lb/> the calixarene macrocycle with an Aβ recognition motif would<lb/> generate a more refined tool to contrast the detrimental effects<lb/> of the aggregated forms of Aβ peptides. Thus, we resorted to<lb/> the design and synthesis of a new calix[4]arene-peptide<lb/> conjugate composed of a p-amino-calix[4]arene derivative<lb/> bearing a GPGKLVFF peptide sequence at the macrocycle<lb/> lower rim. We describe herein the synthesis and structural<lb/> characterization of this hybrid system, alongside its capability<lb/> to hamper Aβ 42 aggregation in vitro. The study has been<lb/> carried out using a variety of spectroscopic techniques<lb/> including circular dichroism (CD), thioflavin T (ThT)<lb/> fluorescence, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and atomic<lb/> force microscopy (AFM) imaging. High resolution mass<lb/> spectrometry (HR-MS) was employed to point out direct<lb/> interaction of the p-amino-calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF conju-<lb/>gate with the Aβ 42 monomer. We also aim at providing in vitro<lb/> experimental evidence of the ability of this novel construct to<lb/> prevent the Aβ oligomer cytotoxic effects on differentiated SH-<lb/>SY5Y neuronal cultures. We demonstrate that the calix-<lb/>peptide conjugate is per se nontoxic to neuronal cells and this<lb/> allows its potential use as therapeutic agent in AD.<lb/></p>

			<head>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<head>Design and Synthesis of Calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF<lb/> (5). </head>

			<p>In search of functional calix[n]arene inhibitors of Aβ<lb/> amyloid fibrillogenesis, we thought that joining an Aβ<lb/> recognition peptide moiety to the framework of a water-<lb/>soluble p-amino-calix[4]arene derivative would result in a new<lb/> hybrid construct able to efficiently interact with Aβ peptides<lb/> and therefore hampering peptide chain&apos;s self-assembly into<lb/> oligomeric/fibrillary toxic species. We chose the GPGKLVFF<lb/> sequence because of the established ability of the KLVFF motif<lb/> to recognize the homologous region of the parent full-length<lb/> Aβ peptide. The additional GPG tripeptide was inserted to<lb/> reduce any eventual propensity to self-aggregation of the<lb/> calix-peptide conjugate. The p-amino-calix[4]arene scaffold<lb/> should confer enhanced water solubility to the resultant calix-<lb/>peptide conjugate, at the same time establishing multiple<lb/> noncovalent contacts with the aromatic and anionic amino acid<lb/> residues of the Aβ peptide. Moreover, it is expected that the<lb/> calix-peptide conjugate would generate a steric hindrance<lb/> between adjacent peptide chains thereby disturbing the Aβ&apos;s<lb/> self-assembly process. Compared to other peptide-conjugated<lb/> systems, the peptide-calixarene difunctional compound can<lb/> offer some advantages deriving from the known complexing<lb/> properties of the calixarene cavity, in addition to the<lb/> antiamyloidogenic action of β-sheet breaker pentapeptide<lb/> KLVFF as a &quot;binding element&quot; for targeting Aβ. The calixarene<lb/> moiety might also synergically assist the peptide ligand in both<lb/> Aβ monomer stabilization and protection of neurons from Aβ<lb/> oligomeric insult. The calix-peptide hybrid system might in<lb/> principle be useful for delivery purposes of AD active<lb/> compounds or imaging agents for theragnostic application.<lb/></p>

			<p>The procedure for the preparation of the calix-peptide<lb/> conjugate (5) starting from compound 1 44 is depicted in<lb/> Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>. In brief, for the preparation of compound 1 <ref type="biblio">44</ref> the<lb/> starting material p-tert-butyl-calix[4]arene was blocked in a<lb/> cone conformation by tetra-functionalization of its lower rim<lb/> with three propyl groups and one ethyl acetate group. Amino<lb/> groups were introduced at the calix[4]arene upper rim, by<lb/> ipso-nitration followed by C/Pd catalyzed reduction of the<lb/> nitro groups. Before the coupling reaction with the peptide<lb/> fragment, the amino groups at the upper rim were protected by<lb/> tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) groups to give compound 2.<lb/> Hydrolysis reaction provided compound 3 in which the<lb/> COOH group at the lower rim can be used for the linkage of<lb/> the GPGK(Dde)LVFF pendant via amide bond (Dde: N-(1-<lb/>(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl). The GPGK-<lb/>(Dde)LVFF sequence was synthesized by using the standard<lb/> microwave assisted Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (mw-SPPS)<lb/> reported in the literature, <ref type="biblio">45</ref> and characterized by HR-ESI-MS<lb/> (see Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref> Supporting Information). Peptide conjugation<lb/> to the calix[4]arene scaffold was accomplished in solution and<lb/> in the presence of PyBop as a condensing agent. The selective<lb/> removal of the Dde and Boc protecting groups, by sequential<lb/> treatment with hydrazine and trifluoroacetic acid respectively,<lb/> gave the compound 5 whose molecular identity was confirmed<lb/> by combined MALDI-TOF-MS, HR-ESI-MS and 1D/2D<lb/> NMR spectra (Supporting Information Figures <ref type="figure">S2-S10</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Calix[4]arene-GPGKLVFF (5)/Aβ 42 Interactions. </head>

			<p>To<lb/> assess the inhibitory properties of 5 toward Aβ 42 fibril<lb/> formation, we carried out a combined CD and ThT<lb/> fluorescence study. DLS and AFM measurements aided the<lb/> determination of the size and morphology of the Aβ 42<lb/> aggregates, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<head>CD Spectroscopy. </head>

			<p>The conformational transition from a<lb/> random coil to a β-sheet structure is the crucial step for the<lb/></p>

			<p>fibrillogenesis of Aβ 42 . <ref type="biblio">46</ref> A series of time course CD<lb/> experiments, either with pure Aβ 42 samples or Aβ 42<lb/> coincubated with compounds 1 or 5 in phosphate buffer (10<lb/> mM, pH 7.4), were carried out to examine the effect of these<lb/> </p>

			<figure>Figure 1. CD spectra of (A) Aβ 42 , (B) Aβ 42 /5 (1:1 molar ratio), and (C) Aβ 42 /5 (1:5 molar ratio) recorded at different times.<lb/> </figure>

			<p>derivatives on the Aβ 42 &apos;s β-sheet conformational transition.<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the CD spectra recorded for Aβ 42 alone and in<lb/> the presence of compound 5. It is clear from Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> that, in<lb/> the absence of 5, the Aβ 42 sample (5 μM) undergoes to an<lb/> almost complete β-sheet conformational transition after 72 h.<lb/> In fact, the freshly prepared Aβ 42 sample displays clear negative<lb/> dichroism below 200 nm that is typical of a randomly coiled<lb/> peptide chain. This curve profile gradually changes toward the<lb/> β-sheet pattern, as the incubation time proceeds. The CD<lb/> spectrum recorded at 72 h incubation time shows positive<lb/> ellipticity at 190 nm along with a negative signal at 218 nm,<lb/> thereby indicating the presence of β-sheet peptide structures. <ref type="biblio">47<lb/></ref> This pattern does not change significantly after this time,<lb/> indicating that Aβ 42 almost reaches the final state after 5 days<lb/> of incubation. The CD spectra recorded in the presence of 5,<lb/> either at equimolar or 5 mol excess, never display the<lb/> characteristic β-sheet pattern. More interestingly, the observed<lb/> CD spectra recorded at 5-fold molar excess always exhibit<lb/> strong negative ellipticity at 190 nm along with no apparent<lb/> inflection of the negative band around 218 nm in the<lb/> considered interval of time. <ref type="biblio">47</ref> The experimental CD curves<lb/> were subjected to deconvolution analysis using the CONTINN<lb/> and CDSSTR algorithms. <ref type="biblio">48</ref> In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the graphical<lb/> representation of the percentage of unordered peptide<lb/> conformation as estimated at t = 0 or t = 120 h is reported.<lb/> The values of the determined random coil secondary structure<lb/> are reported in Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>. It is apparent that at t = 120 h a<lb/> higher percentage of random coil conformation is maintained<lb/> in the presence of the derivative 5 with respect to Aβ 42 control.<lb/> The CD spectra of the calix-peptide conjugate 5 alone were<lb/> recorded in the same experimental conditions. These spectra<lb/> are characterized by a generalized low CD amplitude that does<lb/> not change with time (Figure <ref type="figure">S11</ref>). All the above indicates that<lb/> 5 significantly inhibits the Aβ 42 &apos;s β-sheet conformational<lb/> transition typically associated with the fibrillogenesis process. <ref type="biblio">46<lb/></ref> In other words, the CD results suggest that 5 well preserves the<lb/> Aβ randomly coiled monomer from its recruitment into<lb/> potentially toxic aggregates. We wanted also to evaluate the<lb/> ability of the calix[4]arene macrocycle to interfere with the<lb/> random coil/β-sheet conformational transition of Aβ 42 . We<lb/> then acquired a new set of CD measurements, under the same<lb/> experimental conditions as above, on a sample of Aβ 42 and the<lb/> p-amino-calix[4]arene derivative 1 in both 1:1 and 1:5 molar<lb/> ratios. CD data showed that compound 1 is able to interact<lb/> with Aβ 42 (Figure <ref type="figure">S12</ref>), although to a lesser extent than 5. This<lb/> also became evident from the deconvolution analysis (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">2</ref>) where the percentage of unordered peptide chain is higher<lb/> than the one of the Aβ 42 control at t = 120 h. The inhibitory<lb/> effect of the unconjugated GPGKLVFF on Aβ&apos;s self-assembly<lb/> process was also evaluated for comparison. As expected, the<lb/> CD data demonstrate the ability of the free peptide to interfere<lb/> with the Aβ aggregation (Figure <ref type="figure">S13</ref>). However, the<lb/> comparison with the effects generated by the synthesized<lb/> conjugate 5 allows us to point out some differences. Unlike the<lb/> case of compound 5, at the 1:1 ratio with Aβ, the unconjugated<lb/> GPGKLVFF peptide is able to accelerate the fibrillogenic<lb/> process. This turns evident in the CD experiments (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">S13</ref>). A typical CD profile of the β-sheet conformation was<lb/> observed after 48 h coincubation (Aβ alone reaches the same<lb/> conformation after 72 h). The acceleration of the aggregation<lb/> rate caused massive precipitation, and we were not able to<lb/> acquire CD spectra at 72 h (Figure <ref type="figure">S13</ref>). The CD data<lb/> obtained at a 1:5 ratio indicated that the free GPGKLVFF can<lb/> slow down the aggregation process of Aβ but, in any case, to a<lb/> lesser extent than the one observed in the presence of the<lb/> calix-peptide conjugate at both 1:1 and 1:5 ratios. In<lb/></p>

			<p>conclusion, the CD study suggests that compounds 1 and free<lb/> GPGKLVFF can affect the Aβ 42 propensity to adopt β-sheet<lb/> conformation. Importantly, the CD experiments clearly<lb/> indicated the superiority of the hybrid system 5 in inhibiting<lb/> Aβ 42 aggregation compared to the separate calix or peptide<lb/> moieties.<lb/></p>

			<head>Thioflavin T Fluorescence Assay (ThT). </head>

			<p>The kinetic of Aβ 42<lb/> aggregation was also monitored by ThT fluorescence. ThT is a<lb/> fluorophore that enhances its fluorescence intensity upon<lb/> binding to amyloid fibrils. <ref type="biblio">49</ref> Fluorescence intensity was<lb/> monitored at 482 nm for 67 h and at 37 °C. The results are<lb/> presented in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. In the absence of inhibitors, Aβ 42<lb/> displayed a rapid increase of the ThT fluorescence, as expected<lb/> from the inherent propensity to amyloid formation of this<lb/> peptide. It is also evident that the curve profile observed<lb/> displays just a hint of initial nucleation phase (Figure <ref type="figure">3, black</ref>).<lb/> The prompt formation of aggregated seeds (at t = 0) might be<lb/> the responsible of such behavior. It is assumed that the lower<lb/> fluorescence intensity we observed in the presence of the<lb/> inhibitors at either equimolar ratio or 5-fold molar excess is<lb/> related to a lesser amount of Aβ 42 fibrillary aggregated form.<lb/> The antifibrillogenic activity of the conjugate peptide 5 is<lb/> evident at equimolar ratio (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, red). Interestingly the<lb/> observed profile displays a clear nucleation phase (lag phase),<lb/> that suggests an effective action of compound 5 in the early<lb/> events of Aβ 42 fibrillogenesis.<lb/></p>

			<p>Such an effect becomes even more apparent at 5-fold molar<lb/> excess. As one can see, a very long lag phase, along with a<lb/> negligible increasing of ThT fluorescence intensity, testifies an<lb/> almost complete inhibition of fibril formation (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, light<lb/> blue). The ThT curves related to the kinetic of the calixarene<lb/> precursor 1 or free GPGKLVFF with Aβ 42 also reveal the<lb/> capability of these compounds to interfere with the Aβ 42<lb/> fibrillogenic process, although to a lesser extent than<lb/> compound 5. What we observed was a reduction of the<lb/> fluorescence intensity of the curves, but, again, a clear lag phase<lb/> was not observed. The only exception was the ThT curve<lb/> observed at 1:1 ratio for the free GPGKLVFF. It strongly<lb/> activated Aβ fibril generation (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, green). This<lb/> proaggregating behavior is in keeping with the CD measure-<lb/>ments, and substantial flocculation appeared after 48 h. The<lb/> sample reaches ThT fluorescence max intensity faster than<lb/> Aβ 42 alone. It might be conceivable that the compound may<lb/> somehow self-aggregate and give false positive, but control<lb/> ThT experiments ruled out significant interference occurring<lb/> between ThT and compounds 1, 5 or GPGKLVFF (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">S14</ref>). An alternative interpretation implies the ability of free<lb/> GPGKLVFF compound to become an integral part of ThT<lb/> positive heterofibrils with Aβ 50 (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, pink). The whole of<lb/> the ThT results further confirm that both 1 and 5 exhibit a<lb/> dose responsive antifibrillogenic activity. A quantitative<lb/> analysis of the experimental curves was obtained by proper<lb/> fitting using a suitable equation, and the relevant kinetic<lb/> parameters are reported in the Supporting Information (Table<lb/> <ref type="table">S2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). </head>

			<p>We resorted to DLS<lb/> measurements to determine the average size of the aggregates<lb/> in solution and to monitor their growth over time, either in the<lb/> absence or in the presence of 5. Data were collected at t = 0<lb/> and 120 h and are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> as the analysis of the<lb/> number of scattering objects. <ref type="biblio">51</ref> The analysis indicates that<lb/></p>

Aggregation kinetics detected by in situ ThT fluorescence<lb/> assays of Aβ 42 (20 μM, black) and in the presence of equimolar or 5-<lb/>fold molar excess of compound 1, 5 or GPGKLVFF (Aβ 42 /1 1:1, dark<lb/> blue), (Aβ 42 /11:5, purple), (Aβ 42 /5 1:1, red), (Aβ 42 /5, 1:5 light<lb/> blue), (Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF 1:1, green), (Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF 1:5, pink).<lb/> *The extraction of the kinetic parameters by using the empirical<lb/> equation in the Experimental Section was not possible.<lb/> </figure>

			<p>small aggregates with an average size of 60 nm are the main<lb/> scattering objects in the freshly prepared Aβ 42 sample (t = 0).<lb/> The end stage of Aβ aggregation was analyzed after 120 h, and<lb/> the formation of larger aggregates was observed. In particular,<lb/> the DLS profile indicated the presence of particles with<lb/> increased diameter values (&gt;100 nm) as the most abundant<lb/> scattering entities, along with a very low percentage of bigger<lb/> aggregates with size in the micrometric range. The data<lb/> collected in the presence of 5 clearly indicated the reduction of<lb/> the dimension of Aβ 42 aggregates both at the initial stage and<lb/> end point of monitoring. In fact, at t = 0, the majority of the<lb/> scattering particles in solution displayed a diameter size of<lb/> around 45 nm (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>), whereas only aggregates as large as<lb/> 84 nm were detected after 120 h. It should be said that<lb/> compound 5 alone (5 μM) formed small aggregates with a<lb/> mean hydrodynamic diameter around 8 nm at t = 0. Larger<lb/> aggregates (diameter &gt; 300 nm) were seen at t = 120 h (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">S15</ref>). At 20 μM, compound 5 forms nanoaggregates with a<lb/> mean hydrodynamic diameter of 22 nm and ζ potential 50 ± 2<lb/> mV (Figure <ref type="figure">S16</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>AFM Analysis. </head>

			<p>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies<lb/> revealed the morphologies of Aβ 42 aggregates. Figure <ref type="figure">5a</ref> shows<lb/> that, after 120 h of incubation, Aβ 42 (5 μM) alone formed a<lb/> fibrillary network with an average fibril height of 2.65 ± 0.44<lb/> nm. The copresence of 5, at the same concentration (5 μM),<lb/> during the Aβ 42 incubation time of 120 h, clearly inhibited the<lb/> development of amyloid fibrils, and only small amorphous<lb/> aggregates are detected with sizes of 4.30 ± 1.33 nm (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">5b</ref>). Statistical data for Aβ 42 alone and for copresence of 5 are<lb/> reported in Figure <ref type="figure">5c and d</ref>, respectively. The AFM images<lb/> further confirmed the ability of 5 to inhibit Aβ 42 fibril<lb/> formation in keeping with the spectroscopic results.<lb/> </p>

			<head>MS Study of Aβ 42 /5 and Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF Interactions. </head>

			<p>ESI-<lb/>MS measurements were carried out to verify the formation of<lb/> molecular adducts when GPGKLVFF and the relative<lb/> conjugate 5 were added to the Aβ 42 sample solution. The<lb/> Aβ 42 sample and the 1:5 mixtures of Aβ 42 /5 and Aβ 42 /<lb/> GPGKLVFF, were monomerized using the protocol reported<lb/> in the Experimental Section and lyophilized overnight. The<lb/> lyophilized sample was dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol<lb/> (HFIP) and diluted in H 2 O, to obtain a Aβ 42 final<lb/> </p>

			<p>concentration of 5.5 × 10 -6 M (1% HFIP). The ESI-MS<lb/> spectrum of Aβ 42 reported in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows m/z signals at<lb/> 1129.33 and 1505.43 corresponding to [Aβ 42 ] 4+ and [Aβ 42 ] 3+ ,<lb/> respectively. A closer inspection of the ESI-MS spectrum<lb/> revealed a signal at m/z = 1806.52 corresponding to the mass<lb/> of the dimeric peptide in the +5 charge state (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, inset).<lb/> This signal disappeared in the mass spectra acquired in the<lb/> Aβ 42 /5 sample (Figure <ref type="figure">S17</ref>), whereas m/z signals 1507.79 and<lb/> 2010.06 corresponding to the +4 and +3 charge state of Aβ 42 /<lb/> 5 adduct were observed. Similar effects were seen in the mass<lb/> spectrum of the Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF sample (Figure <ref type="figure">S18</ref>). Here,<lb/> m/z signals 1345.20 and 1793.27 can be assigned to the [Aβ 42 /<lb/> GPGKLVFF] 4+ and [Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF] 3+ adducts, respec-<lb/>tively, with concomitant loss of the dimeric form of Aβ 42 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite the mass spectrometric results were deduced from<lb/> the gas-phase system, they nicely support what was observed in<lb/> solution in terms of direct interactions between Aβ 42 and<lb/> GPGKLVFF or 5. Nevertheless, this study reveals that the<lb/> dimeric form of Aβ 42 is no longer detectable in the MS<lb/> spectrum when either GPGKLVFF or 5 is present in the<lb/> sample solution. Such evidence suggests, once more, that these<lb/> interactions occur in the solution phase and may play a role in<lb/> the early events of the Aβ 42 aggregation process. As reported in<lb/> our previous works, <ref type="biblio">16,27</ref> the identification of proteolysis<lb/> resistant peptides fragments by mass spectrometry may reveal<lb/> the binding region of Aβ 42 to specific molecules. Indeed,<lb/> cleavage of the peptide bonds by a protease is rapid in easily<lb/> accessible unstructured regions of a polypeptide, whereas the<lb/> steric hindrance of other molecules at the cleavage sites should<lb/> affect the rate of hydrolysis. We analyzed the Aβ 42 peptide<lb/> fragments generated after 2 h of trypsin digestion. This enzyme<lb/> selectively catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds at the C-<lb/>terminal side of lysyl and arginyl residues. As a matter of fact,<lb/> the peptide fragments Aβ(1-5), Aβ(6-16), and Aβ(17-28)<lb/> were detected in the ESI-MS spectrum (see Figure <ref type="figure">S19</ref>),<lb/> indicating the cleavages expected occur at positions 5, 16, and<lb/> 28 of Aβ 42 . The peptide fragment Aβ(1-16) was also<lb/> observed. It could be related to the conformational features<lb/> of Aβ 42 that affect the accessibility to the Arg-5-His-6 cleavage<lb/> site (Scheme <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). The absence of signals corresponding to<lb/> Aβ 42 suggested that protein digestion by trypsin was totally<lb/> accomplished after 2 h (Figure <ref type="figure">7a</ref>). Interestingly, the peptide<lb/> fragments Aβ(17-42), Aβ(6-42), and full length Aβ 42 ,<lb/> imputable to incomplete Aβ 42 processing, were observed in<lb/> the mass spectra (Figures <ref type="figure">7b and 8b</ref>, Scheme <ref type="figure">S2</ref>) recorded<lb/> after 2 h of trypsin digestion in the copresence of 5. Similar<lb/> results were observed in mass spectra of Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF<lb/> mixture (data not shown). It is important to note that both<lb/> GPGKLVFF and 5 were also subjected to trypsin degradation<lb/></p>

			<p>indicating that these peptides do not inhibit enzyme&apos;s activity.<lb/> Therefore, it can be envisioned that the interaction of<lb/> GPGKLVFF or 5 with Aβ 42 affects the processing of the<lb/> amyloid protein by trypsin. Oxidized forms of Aβ and related<lb/> fragments were seen in the MS spectra. Oxidation of peptides<lb/> and proteins during electrospray ionization may occur because<lb/> the generation of ions in ESI source is related to an<lb/> electrochemical process. <ref type="biblio">52<lb/></ref> </p>

			<head>Cytotoxicity Studies. </head>
				
			<p>Based on the previous promising<lb/> results, we tested the peptide conjugate 5 for its biological<lb/> activity in order to (i) exclude any potential toxicity to<lb/> neuronal cells and more interestingly (ii) assess its ability to<lb/> prevent oligomers toxicity. For this purpose, we used the<lb/> neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, fully differentiated accord-<lb/>ing to a well-established protocol (see the Experimental<lb/> Section). After prolonged treatments with all-trans-retinoic<lb/> acid (RA) and the consequent acquisition of a<lb/> phenotype, we exposed cells to increasing concentrations of<lb/> compound 5 (0.1, 5, 20, 50 μM) for 24 h (Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). The<lb/> peptides KLVFF and GPGKLVFF were also added as controls.<lb/> As expected, the peptide KLVFF as well as the longer peptide<lb/> containing the tripeptide GPG sequence (GPGKLVFF)<lb/> revealed similar activity to that of control. Interestingly, no<lb/> toxicity was observed for compound 5 at any of the<lb/> concentrations used, with a positive, even if not statistically<lb/> significant, trend between dose (0.1-20 μM) and cellular<lb/> response, after 24 h exposure. Hence, we tested the ability of<lb/> compound 5 to protect neurons from the Aβ 42 oligomer<lb/> cytotoxic insult. Aβ oligomers (oAβs) were obtained from<lb/> freshly prepared solution of Aβ 42 , incubated for 48 h at 4 °C in<lb/> the presence or in the absence of the calixarene-peptide<lb/> conjugate 5.<lb/></p>

			<p>Aβ oligomers obtained following the incubation were added<lb/> at the final concentration of 2 μM, alone or in combination<lb/> with all of the compounds at the molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:5.<lb/> Cells, were then exposed for 48 h to each coincubated mixture<lb/> and cell viability was quantified by MTT assay. As shown in<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>, Aβ oligomers induce a slight but statistically<lb/> significant reduction of cell viability that is clearly prevented in<lb/> the presence of compound 5. We have already reported on the<lb/> antioligomerization activity of a trehalose conjugated LPFFD<lb/> peptide. <ref type="biblio">53</ref> The newly synthesized compound shows a similar<lb/> interesting effect of the Aβ derived pentapeptide with a better<lb/> trend, making this functionalization even more promising also<lb/> in the light of calix[4]arenes ability to be potentially loaded<lb/> with selected drugs. The biological effect observed on SH-<lb/>SY5Y differentiated cells has been also confirmed by SDS-<lb/>polyacrylamide gel experiments. The same solutions used to<lb/> treat the cells were in fact loaded onto 4-12% gel<lb/> polyacrylamide to assess the amount and size of Aβ 42<lb/> aggregates formed in the presence of the compound 5 or its<lb/> related controls. Two different concentrations of Aβ 42 have<lb/> been used and each peptide added with a molar ratio of 1:5.<lb/> Results show that, as expected, Aβ alone during 48 h<lb/> incubations at 4 °C was able to give rise to the typical<lb/> migration pattern in which low molecular weight size (LMW:<lb/> monomers, dimers, and tetramers) and high molecular weight<lb/> (HMW: &gt;50 kDa oligomers) size are observed (Figure <ref type="figure">S20</ref>).<lb/> Coincubation with compound 5 strongly decreases the HMW<lb/> band signal, which confirmed that our compound interferes<lb/> with Aβ aggregation.<lb/></p>

			<head>■ CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>In the present work, we have described the design, synthesis,<lb/> and biophysical properties of a new calixarene-peptide<lb/> construct that combines the Aβ recognition ability of the<lb/> GPGKLVFF sequence with the host and recognition proper-<lb/>ties of the calixarene macrocycle. This novel compound is able<lb/> to prevent cross-β-sheet elongation of Aβ 42 through a<lb/> synergistic action of both calixarene and peptide moieties<lb/> that can be considered as β-sheet breaker elements. This is an<lb/> interesting example of a small construct being able to preserve<lb/> the nontoxic monomeric species of Aβ 42 from being recruited<lb/></p>

			<p>into oligomeric/fibrillar aggregated forms, as demonstrated by<lb/> circular dichroism and ThT fluorescence. The lack of toxicity,<lb/> combined with the significant protective action on neuronal<lb/> cells, further points toward a considerable therapeutic potential<lb/> of this novel construct. Moreover, given the already established<lb/> pharmaceutical functions of calixarenes in drug delivery, our<lb/> findings suggest that the conjugate has great potential as a<lb/> vehicle for the targeted delivery of additional therapeutic<lb/> agents in AD. In fact, due to the presence of calix[4]arene and<lb/> peptide moieties, multiple potential actions can be expected,<lb/> and the possibility that the calixarene cavity offers to host and<lb/> transport a variety of guests, such as drugs or imaging agents,<lb/> opens up interesting perspectives for further investigations in<lb/> diagnosis and therapy for amyloid related diseases. The<lb/> calix[n]arene family offers a variety of macrocyclic scaffolds<lb/> differing in size and structural conformation that, together with<lb/> the versatility and ease of functionalization, may provide an<lb/> additional tool for the development of other peptide-<lb/>calixarene conjugates for Aβ aggregation inhibitors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Materials and Instrumentation. </head>

			<p>All the reagents were of<lb/> analytical grade. Calix[4]arene derivative 1 <ref type="biblio">44</ref> and GPGKLVFF<lb/> peptide were prepared according to standard chemical procedures<lb/> reported below. Aβ 42 was obtained from Bachem (Switzerland).<lb/> MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded on the SCIEX TOF/TOF 5800<lb/> instrument. The MALDI-MS spectra were carried out using α-CHCA<lb/> as a matrix with a thin layer deposition method. Lyophilized samples<lb/> (0.1 mg) were dissolved in 100 μL of 1:1:0.01 acetonitrile/water/<lb/> TFA. Sinapinic acid (SIN) and α-CHCA were prepared by dissolving<lb/> 4-8 mg/vial of matrices in 1 mL of 50% acetonitrile in 0.3% TFA and<lb/> 1 mL of 30% acetonitrile in 0.3% TFA, respectively. Standard kits<lb/> were used to calibrate the mass scale of the MALDI mass<lb/> spectrometer. The Peptide Mass standard kit includes des-Arg1-<lb/>bradikynin, angiotensin I, Glu1-fibrinopeptide B, ACTH (Clip 1-17),<lb/> ACTH (Clip 18-39), and ACTH (Clip 7-38), and it was used to<lb/> cover a mass range of 800-4000 Da.<lb/> </p>

			<p>1 H NMR (400.13 MHz), 13 C NMR (100.61 MHz), and 2D NMR<lb/> spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer.<lb/> Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per million (ppm),<lb/> referenced to the residual methanol peak; coupling constant (J) values<lb/> are given in Hz.<lb/></p>

			<head>Synthesis of GPGK(Dde)LVFF. </head>

			<p>The peptide was synthesized using<lb/> the microwave assisted solid phase peptide synthesis strategy on a<lb/> Liberty Peptide Synthesizer (CEM). The peptide chain assembly was<lb/> carried out on a NovaSyn TGR resin (substitution 0.22 mmol/g)<lb/> using the Fmoc chemistry method. All Fmoc-amino acids were<lb/> introduced according to the TBTU/HOBT/DIEA or COMU<lb/> activation methods. All syntheses were carried out under a 4-fold<lb/> excess of amino acid. Removal of Fmoc protection during synthesis<lb/> was achieved by means of 20% piperidine solution in DMF. The<lb/> following instrumental conditions were used for each coupling cycle:<lb/> microwave power 25 W, reaction temperature 75 °C, coupling time<lb/> 300 s. The instrumental conditions used for the deprotection cycles<lb/> were: microwave power 25 W, reaction temperature 75 °C,<lb/> deprotection time 180 s. The peptides were cleaved off from the<lb/> resin using a mixture of TFA/H 2 O/TIS (95:2.5:2.5 v/v/v). Crude<lb/> peptides were recovered by precipitation with freshly distilled diethyl<lb/> ether. The purification of crude GPGK(Dde)LVFF was carried out by<lb/> preparative reversed-phase HPLC using a SHIMADZU LC-20A<lb/> chromatography system equipped with a SPD-M20A photodiode<lb/> diode array detector with detection at 222 and 254 nm. A Kinetex<lb/> C18 250 × 21.10 mm (100 Å pore size, AXIA Packed) column was<lb/> used. The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 10 mL/min according<lb/> to the following protocol: from 0 to 5 min isocratic conditions in 95%<lb/> solvent A (H 2 O containing 0.1% TFA) followed by a 20 min linear<lb/> gradient from 5 to 70% B (CH 3 CN containing 0.1% TFA) and then 5<lb/> min isocratic conditions in 70% B. Fractions containing the desired<lb/> product were collected and lyophilized. Sample identity was<lb/> confirmed by ESI-ORPBITRAP MASS. Calculated mass: 1026.59;<lb/> observed: [M + H] + = 1027.59; [M + 2H] 2+ = 514.30.<lb/></p>

			<head>Sample Preparation. </head>
				
			<p>Aβ 42 was dissolved in TFA (1 mg/mL) and<lb/> sonicated for 10 min. Then the TFA was removed under a gentle<lb/> stream of N 2 , 1 mL of HFIP was added, and the mixture was dried<lb/> under N 2 stream to remove the remaining trace of TFA (×2). Aβ 42<lb/> was again dissolved in 1 mL of HFIP and was frozen at -70 °C and<lb/> then lyophilized overnight. The same procedure was carried out in the<lb/> presence of conjugate 5.<lb/></p>

			<head>Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy. </head>
				
			<p>CD spectra were acquired using<lb/> a J-810 spectrometer (Jasco, Japan) under a constant flow of N 2 at<lb/> room temperature. The CD spectra were recorded for Aβ 42 (5 μM)<lb/> monomer in the absence and presence of 1 and 5 (5 and 25 μM). The<lb/> lyophilized samples were dissolved in 50 μL of 10 mM NaOH and<lb/> then diluted with 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 100<lb/> mM NaCl to 2 mL to obtain a concentration 5 μM for Aβ 42 alone and<lb/> the mixture of Aβ 42 and conjugate 5 (1:1 and 1:5 molar ratio). A 1 cm<lb/> path length quartz cuvette was used to acquire the far-UV CD spectra<lb/> (190-260 nm) at a scan speed of 50 nm/min. There were 10 scans<lb/> collected. The CD signal of the solution without Aβ 42 was subtracted<lb/> from the sample CD spectra. The measurements were performed in<lb/> triplicate.<lb/></p>

			<head>Thioflavin T Fluorescence Assay. </head>
				
			<p>ThT fluorescence kinetics were<lb/> measured on a Flash Thermo Varioskan spectrofluorometer with<lb/> excitation and emission at 450 and 480 nm, respectively. Aβ 42 alone<lb/> and in the presence of the conjugates 1 or 5 in 1:1 or 1:5 molar ratio<lb/> was dissolved in 10 mM aq NaOH (30 μL). The samples were diluted<lb/> (to 150 μL) with 60 μM ThT solution in 10 mM phosphate buffer at<lb/> pH 7.4 to obtain a final Aβ 42 concentration of 20 μM. The samples<lb/> were incubated a 37 °C in a 96-well plate. To minimize evaporation<lb/> effects the multiwell plate was sealed with a transparent heat-resistant<lb/> plastic film. Readings were taken every 10 min, after weak shaking for<lb/> 10 s. The fluorescence intensity was monitored for 67 h. The<lb/> measurements were performed in triplicate. To minimize errors<lb/> during sample preparation, we freeze dried the aliquots of<lb/> monomerized Aβ 42 and 5 directly into each well of the plate. The<lb/> experimental data were fitted by using the equation:<lb/></p>

			<p>where F 0 is the initial fluorescence emission and F max is the final<lb/> increment of fluorescence emission; 1/k is the elongation rate<lb/> constant, and t 1/2 is the time at which the amplitude of ThT emission<lb/> is 50% of the F max value. t lag is defined as the intercept between the<lb/> time axis and the tangent of the curve with slope k from the midpoint<lb/> of the fitted sigmoidal curve; this parameter was calculated from the<lb/> fitted parameters by using the following equation: t lag = t 1/2 -2k.<lb/> </p>

			<p>DLS and ELS measurements were carried out on<lb/> a ZetaSizer NanoZS90 Malvern instrument (UK), equipped with a<lb/> 633 nm laser at a scattering angle of 90°and 25 °C temperature. The<lb/> size of Aβ 42 , conjugate 5, and Aβ 42 in the presence of 5 was<lb/> determined on samples prepared at the same experimental conditions<lb/> as CD analyses. Each measurement was performed three times.<lb/></p>

			<head>Atomic Force Microscopy. </head>
				
			<p>AFM analysis was performed with a<lb/> PSIAXE-150 system, acquiring images of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 μm 2 . The<lb/> measurements were carried out in tapping mode using a silicon Sn<lb/> doped tip (resistivity of 0.01 Ω cm and purchased by Bruker TESPA).<lb/> New cantilevers were used for each measurement. Tip dimensions:<lb/> thickness 4 μm, length 125 μm, width 40 μm. The stiffness was 40 N/<lb/> m, and the tip was operated to an oscillation frequency of 320 kHz.<lb/> An aliquot with a volume of 10 μL of sample was dispensed on a<lb/> precleaned silicon flat substrate and dried. In order to perform a<lb/> representative investigation of whole samples, after deposition the<lb/> substrates were not rinsed with Milli-Q water (as commonly reported<lb/> in literature). For each sample, various areas on the sample were<lb/> investigated and statistically relevant images were chosen.<lb/></p>

			<p>The lyophilized Aβ 42 was dissolved<lb/> in HFIP (hexafluoroisopropanol) to obtain a concentration of 2.2 ×<lb/> 10 -4 M (Aβ 42 stock solution). The GPGKLVFF peptide and<lb/> compound 5 were dissolved in HFIP to obtain a stock solution of<lb/> 1.1 × 10 -3 M for each. The Aβ 42 sample and the mixtures of Aβ 42 /<lb/> GPGKLVFF and Aβ 42 /5 at 1:5 ratios, were prepared from stock<lb/> solutions to a final concentration [Aβ 42 ] = 5.5 × 10 -6 M, [5] =<lb/> [GPGKLVFF] = 27.5 × 10 -6 M in Milli-Q water at physiological pH.<lb/> For proteolysis experiments, 25 × 10 -6 g of trypsin enzyme was<lb/> dissolved in HCl 1 × 10 -3 M [trypsin] = 2.14 × 10 -5 M, and then an<lb/> appropriate volume of the enzyme stock solution was added to the<lb/> Aβ 42 , Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF, and Aβ 42 /5 samples to obtain a final<lb/> enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 w/w. Solutions were incubated at 37<lb/> °C, and then the digestion reactions were stopped after 2 h by adding<lb/> 1 μL 0.3% aqueous TFA. The samples were analyzed by using an ESI-<lb/>MS Orbitrap Q-exactive system (Thermos Scientific). Each sample<lb/> was introduced into the ESI source on 100 mm internal diameter<lb/> fused silica via a 500 mL syringe. Full MS scans in the m/z range<lb/> 400-4000 were acquired in the positive ion mode, spray voltage = 3.5<lb/> kV, capillary temperature = 300 °C; m/z range = 400-4000, S-lens<lb/> RF level = 60 V, sheath gas = 7, resolving power: 70 000 fwhm. The<lb/> spectra, recorded as raw files, were imported in Qual Browser<lb/> (Thermo Scientific) software for analysis. Averaged MS spectra were<lb/> imported into a freely available open-source software, mMass (http://<lb/> www.mmass.org). Theoretical m/z values of Aβ 42 , GPGKLVFF, 5, the<lb/> adducts Aβ 42 /GPGKLVFF and Aβ 42 /5, and the peptides resulting<lb/> from in silico digestion of Aβ 42 were compared with the m/z values<lb/> assigned to experimental mass spectra. Peptides that matched<lb/> successfully, within a tolerance of 0.005 Da, were annotated.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cell Cultures and MTT Assay. </head>
				
			<p>The neuroblastoma (NB) cell line,<lb/> SH-SY5Y, was maintained in DMEM-F12 (Gibco, ThermoFisher)<lb/> supplemented with 10% heat inactivated (HI) fetal calf serum (Gibco,<lb/> ThermoFisher), 100 mg/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco,<lb/> ThermoFisher), and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 . Two weeks<lb/> before experiments, 5 × 10 3 cells were plated on 96-well plates in<lb/> DMEM-F12 with 5% HI fetal calf serum. The percentage of serum<lb/> was gradually decreased until it was 1% of the total. All-trans-retinoic<lb/> acid (RA) (Sigma), 5 μM, was used to promote neuronal<lb/> differentiation, and medium-containing RA was changed every 3<lb/> days. Treatments with compound 5, KLVFF, and GPGKLVFF were<lb/> performed on fully differentiated cells. After 24 h treatment, cultures<lb/> were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) for 2 h at 37 °C and then<lb/> lysed with DMSO, and the formazan production was evaluated in a<lb/> plate reader through the absorbance at 570 nm.<lb/></p>

			<head>Antioligomerization Assay. </head>
				
			<p>Aβ 42 oligomers were prepared as<lb/> previously described <ref type="biblio">53</ref> from synthetic Aβ 42 following a protocol for<lb/> monomerization. An amount of 1 mg of Aβ 42 was first dissolved in 5<lb/> mM DMSO. A solution of 10 μM Aβ 42 in ice-cold DMEM F-12<lb/> without Phenol Red was prepared and allowed to oligomerize for 48 h<lb/> at 4 °C according to the Lambert protocol <ref type="biblio">54</ref> with some modification<lb/> as previously described. <ref type="biblio">55</ref> In order to evaluate the ability of<lb/> compound 5 and the other appropriate controls (KLVFF,<lb/> GPGKLVFF), samples of Aβ 42 (10 μM) were incubated in the<lb/> presence or absence of each compound (Aβ/ligand ratios 1:1, 1:5).<lb/> After 48 h incubation, Aβ/ligand compounds were applied to the<lb/> differentiated SH-SY5Y cells at the final concentration of 2 μM Aβ.<lb/></p>

			<head>Western Blot Analysis. </head>
				
			<p>A stock aliquot of 5 mM Aβ previously<lb/> dissolved in DMSO was diluted in DMEM F-12 without Phenol Red,<lb/> and two different samples at 20 μM and 50 μM concentrations were<lb/> prepared. From each solution, two sets of samples were obtained by<lb/> combining Aβ 42 with KLVFF peptide, GPGKLVFF, or compound 5<lb/> with a molar ratio Aβ/peptide of 1:5. All the samples, including Aβ<lb/> alone at the two concentrations used, were incubated at 4 °C for 48 h<lb/> to form Aβ oligomers. After incubation, the amount and size of Aβ<lb/> aggregates were determined by Western blot analysis. A volume of 25<lb/> μL of each unheated sample was loaded onto a precast Bis-Tris gel<lb/> (Bolt 4-12%, Life Technologies) with 2-morpholin-4-yl ethanesul-<lb/>fonic acid (MES). Samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose<lb/> membrane (0.2 mm, Hybond ECL, Amersham Italia) by using a wet<lb/> transfer unit Mini Blot Module (Life Technologies). Membranes were<lb/> blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-COR Biosciences) and<lb/> incubated at 4 °C overnight with mouse monoclonal anti-amyloid-β<lb/> antibody against N-terminal 1-16 peptide (1:1000) (Covance). A<lb/> secondary goat anti-mouse antibody labeled with IR dye 800<lb/> (1:25 000) was used at rt for 45 min. Hybridization signals were<lb/> detected with the Odyssey CLx infrared imaging system (LI-COR<lb/> Biosciences, Lincoln, NE).</p>
