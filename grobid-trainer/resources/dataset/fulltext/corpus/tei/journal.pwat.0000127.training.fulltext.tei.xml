			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) aims to &apos;ensure the availability and sustainable<lb/> management of water and sanitation for all&apos; by 2030 <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. The accompanying target 6.1, is to<lb/> achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking-water. The associated<lb/> indicator, 6.1.1, measures progress towards this target via the proportion of the population<lb/> using safely managed drinking-water services, requiring that drinking-water from an<lb/> improved service be available when needed <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. Additionally, the World Health Organization<lb/> (WHO) outlines a global drinking-water availability benchmark which recommends that a<lb/> minimum of 50 litres/capita/day (LPCD) is needed to meet domestic needs, including wash-<lb/>ing, personal hygiene and cleaning <ref type="biblio">[3, 4]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Between 2000 and 2020 the proportion of the sub-Saharan African (SSA) population using<lb/> improved drinking-water sources that were available when needed increased from 41% to 59%<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. Over the same period, the population in SSA using piped water doubled from 185 to 380 mil-<lb/>lion. However, coverage of piped water services in urban areas has not kept up with population<lb/> growth, declining from 65% to 59% between 2000 and 2020 <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. In 2015, an estimated 116 million<lb/> people in Africa were supplied by an unreliable piped water system prone to interruptions <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>.<lb/> Water services that are not available when needed may result in damage to water service infra-<lb/>structure, compromise water safety <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>, adversely impact health <ref type="biblio">[8, 9]</ref>, and lead to additional<lb/> household expenditure on water storage, treatment and purchasing supplementary water <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>,<lb/> with the latter often sourced from informal service providers and unimproved services <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The transition from the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to the SDGs saw the spe-<lb/>cific addition of water availability to the international agenda, resulting in new demand for<lb/> data sources for monitoring <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. Multiple sources, including household surveys (hereafter<lb/> &apos;user data&apos;), utility companies (hereafter &apos;provider data&apos;) and government regulators <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>, hold<lb/> data on water service intermittency. Historically household survey questions on the availability<lb/> of drinking water services have not been harmonised, thus different countries may not use<lb/> consistent question and response wording. This complex data landscape is further exacerbated<lb/> by the challenges of measuring water availability, for which methods vary between studies<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. Metrics used include hours of service a day alongside service in the last week or month,<lb/> using household or per capita consumption per day, or the number of interruptions or break-<lb/>ages in a given time period <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. In 2018, the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) of the WHO<lb/> and United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF), who are responsible for international moni-<lb/>toring of SDG target 6.1, published a core question, &apos;In the last month, has there been any time<lb/> when your household did not have sufficient quantities of drinking-water when needed?&apos;, for<lb/> greater harmonisation and incorporation into household surveys for availability monitoring.<lb/> Since this is a new question and household surveys are implemented only every three to five<lb/> years, availability of internationally comparable survey data remains patchy.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a result of patchy data and the use of multiple metrics of availability, national and inter-<lb/>national monitoring has been reliant on numerous data sources, presenting challenges for data<lb/> integration. Under the MDGs, monitoring was primarily dependent on household surveys<lb/> and census data <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>, whereas more recently under the SDGs, there has been a shift towards<lb/> using information from regulators of providers alongside these more traditional sources <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>.<lb/> Regulators often produce annual reports which benchmark levels of service between different<lb/> providers. An additional data source concerning piped water service levels is available directly<lb/> from service provider records <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. Many service providers report their performance data to<lb/> the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities (IBNET). At pres-<lb/>ent, IBNET provides the most systematic international data on provider reported water avail-<lb/>ability <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>following report: https://www.nwasco.org.zm/<lb/> index.php/media-center/publications/water-supply-<lb/>and-sanitation-sector-reports. All code and publicly<lb/> available data has been provided as supplementary<lb/> materials to allow full transparency and replication<lb/> of the analysis that has been undertaken.<lb/></p>

			<p>To date, most studies that have sought to quantify risk factors for interruptions in water ser-<lb/>vices have focused almost exclusively on household surveys <ref type="biblio">[19-21]</ref>. In comparing provider<lb/> and user data, one study conducted bespoke household surveys within four case study provider<lb/> coverage areas (PCAs) in Kenya and Ghana <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>, whilst a second compared user-reported and<lb/> provider-reported service continuity at regional level in Peru <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. However, since many<lb/> household surveys are now georeferenced <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>, the new household survey question on service<lb/> continuity provides an opportunity for spatial integration of household reports of water service<lb/> interruptions with related statistics reported by service providers and regulators. Such spatial<lb/> integration would enable more detailed assessment of household versus regulator-or pro-<lb/>vider-reported service continuity for consistency, alongside evaluation of provider-level risk<lb/> factors for household-reported interruptions such as supply-side service management<lb/> indicators.<lb/></p>

			<p>Barriers inhibiting household access to uninterrupted water services may exacerbate urban-<lb/>rural and socio-economic disparities that are evident in drinking-water services. In 2020, only<lb/> 13% of the rural SSA population used services that were safely managed compared to 54% of<lb/> the urban population <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. With the SDGs seeking to &apos;leave no one behind&apos;, identifying and<lb/> addressing drivers of inequalities in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services is critical.<lb/> In a city-scale study of Lilongwe, Malawi, water rationing of the formal water system led to<lb/> more irregular supply in low-income informal settlements <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>, highlighting one driver of<lb/> such inequalities. However, whilst wealth quintile was associated with rural household access<lb/> to continuous water in Bangladesh and Pakistan <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>, there is little evidence on urban or per-<lb/>urban inequalities in household access to continuous piped water in addition to such inequali-<lb/>ties at city or PCA scale.<lb/></p>

			<p>The primary objective of this study was therefore to assess the added value of utility and<lb/> regulator data in estimating piped water availability and quantifying risk factors for piped<lb/> water intermittency and related inequalities. As secondary objectives, the study aims to assess<lb/> whether household survey data are sufficient in isolation to quantify water availability and<lb/> related risk factors, alongside identifying barriers to more widespread integrated analyses of<lb/> household survey, utility, and regulatory data sets. Data on water service availability from<lb/> users, providers and regulators were first mapped to identify a suitable case study country to<lb/> examine risk factors for user-reported interruptions in piped water services in SSA. Since<lb/> Africa shows the least progress towards SDG 6 <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>, and Zambia had near contemporaneous<lb/> data from users, providers and regulators that could be spatially linked, it was selected as the<lb/> case study.<lb/></p>

			<head>Materials and methods<lb/></head>

			<head>Ethical approval<lb/></head>

			<p>Ethical approval for the use of all data was received from the University of Southampton Ethics<lb/> Committee (Submission ID # 55516) on 10th March 2020.<lb/></p>

			<head>Study country selection<lb/></head>

			<p>A systematic secondary data audit (<ref type="figure">S1</ref> Fig; <ref type="table">S1-S3</ref> Tables) was undertaken via the JMP&apos;s 2019<lb/> country files <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref> and IBNET database <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref> to identify an African Union (AU) member state<lb/> for which household survey or population census data, government regulator data and water<lb/> providers all report at least one water availability metric (i.e. a measure of the quantity of<lb/> household water supplied, or continuity of water service provision) covering the same year(s).<lb/> To facilitate subsequent multi-level analysis, countries eligible for inclusion required<lb/> household survey or census data geographically disaggregated to sub-provincial level and pro-<lb/>vider or regulator data disaggregated to at least province level or equivalent coverage area.<lb/></p>

			<p>Half of AU member states (n = 27) lacked relevant household survey or census data on<lb/> availability and were excluded (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Of the remaining 27 that had user data, only five had<lb/> user, provider and regulator data that each captured water availability. For each of the five<lb/> shortlisted countries, the three data streams were mapped using ArcMap 10.7.1. This<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 1. Available data for each of the 54 African Union member states. (GADM 2018 base layer available at: https://gadm.org/index.html).<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pwat.0000127.g001<lb/></figure>

			<p>determined whether subsequent integration of the three data streams was possible. Zambia<lb/> was the only country where the administrative geography of drinking-water supply was suffi-<lb/>ciently simple to facilitate spatial linkage of household survey and provider data since PCA<lb/> (which are also used by the regulator) coincided with province boundaries. All three Zambian<lb/> data sources also covered the same year (<ref type="table">S1</ref> Table).<lb/></p>

			<head>Study site<lb/></head>

			<p>Located in southern-central Africa, Zambia is a landlocked country with a 2019 population of<lb/> nearly 19 million <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>; 45% live in urban areas <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>. Zambia&apos;s trans-boundary catchment areas<lb/> result in fluctuations of surface water availability because of the varying water demands of<lb/> neighbouring states <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>. Renewable water resources are affected by inconsistent seasonal rain-<lb/>fall, characterised by periodic drought <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>. Mismanagement and rapid urban growth have<lb/> also caused considerable stress on groundwater resources <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Urban and peri-urban piped drinking-water is supplied to over six million people by 11<lb/> commercial Water and Sewerage Companies (WSCs) <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref>. Approximately 4,656,375 piped<lb/> water connections supply drinking-water in 91 towns (<ref type="table">S4</ref> Table). In total, an estimated 46% of<lb/> the urban population have a safely managed water service, that is available when needed <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>.<lb/> In rural Zambia, 35% have an unimproved service compared to 9% of the urban population<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>. The National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (NWASCO), a statutory body, is<lb/> responsible for regulating water and sanitation services across Zambia <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Data sources and availability metrics<lb/></head>

			<p>We used three main data sources in our study:<lb/></p>

			<p>1. User data: nationally representative data from the Zambian Demographic and Health Sur-<lb/>vey (DHS) was used. This was implemented as a multi-stage cluster household survey from<lb/> 18 th July 2018 to 24 th January 2019 <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. Interviews were undertaken concurrently across all<lb/> provinces, using a stratified two-stage sample design <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. We used geospatial data, geore-<lb/>ferenced to cluster level (comprising groups of approximately 25 households, selected at<lb/> random from a given census enumeration area). Cluster locations are provided as the mean<lb/> GPS coordinates for all participating households within each cluster, displaced within 2km<lb/> (for urban areas) to retain anonymity <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref>. No sampling clusters were displaced outside of<lb/> their administrative district. To assess drinking-water availability, participating households<lb/> are asked &apos;In the last two weeks, was the water from your main source not available for at<lb/> least one full day?&apos;.<lb/></p>

			<p>2. Provider data: To assess provider-level risk factors for reported interruptions, provider-<lb/>reported availability of piped services for all 11 WSCs was obtained from the IBNET data-<lb/>base for 2017, the most recent year available <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>. This includes metrics of availability, such<lb/> as continuity of service, as yearly average hours of service per day (hrs/day) <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>, and yearly<lb/> average residential consumption in LPCD <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>. Details of non-revenue water, the difference<lb/> in water supplied and sold as a percentage of net water supplied <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>, which inherently<lb/> affects service availability <ref type="biblio">[40, 41]</ref> were also of interest as these reflect illegal use of piped<lb/> networks and water that has been stolen or leaked from the system.<lb/></p>

			<p>3.Regulator data: since 2001, NWASCO have also annually reported on each WSC&apos;s perfor-<lb/>mance based on nine key indicators <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. The annual average duration of water service<lb/> (hours/day) at the customer connection, and the average amount of water consumed in<lb/> LPCD were extracted from the publicly available 2018 NWASCO report <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref> for each<lb/> WSC.<lb/></p>

			<head>Household inclusion criteria and data integration<lb/></head>

			<p>With less than 5% of rural households using piped drinking-water services <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>, provider and<lb/> regulator data from NWASCO do not cover rural areas <ref type="biblio">[43]</ref>. Given this, 8,117 households in<lb/> 347 rural clusters (comprising 16% of households nationally reporting piped water as their<lb/> drinking-water source) were excluded (Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>). 47 households in two clusters which had miss-<lb/>ing GPS coordinates were also excluded. Provider service area boundaries for regulator and<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 2. Flowchart, showing reasons for excluding households participating in the 2018 Zambian Demographic and Health<lb/> Survey from analysis (n = number of households).<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pwat.0000127.g002<lb/></figure>

			<p>provider data were derived through aggregation of district administrative boundaries for Zam-<lb/>bia from the Global Administrative Areas (GADM) database <ref type="biblio">[44]</ref> and spatially joined to DHS<lb/> household clusters in ArcMap 10.7.1. The final dataset therefore included information on the<lb/> provider and regulator perspective of water availability at the PCA level (henceforth &apos;provider-<lb/>level&apos;) and the user perspective at household-level.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>Households that did not drink piped water (whether from a connection in dwelling, yard/<lb/> plot, neighbour or public tap/standpipe) were excluded (n = 1574) as they were not asked<lb/> about water service continuity <ref type="biblio">[45]</ref>, as were those who did not know about their piped water<lb/> continuity (n = 46) (Fig <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Outcome and explanatory variables<lb/></head>

			<p>A binary outcome variable &apos;user reported availability of piped water&apos; was defined as respon-<lb/>dents reporting at least one full day of interruptions in the two weeks prior to being surveyed.<lb/> Explanatory variables at the household-, cluster-and provider-level were chosen to represent<lb/> socio-economic, water source, or neighbourhood characteristics that could constitute risk fac-<lb/>tors for piped water interruptions (<ref type="table">S5 and S6</ref> Tables). Household cluster-level variables were<lb/> created by aggregating data on households within each DHS cluster.<lb/></p>

			<p>In modelling user-reported availability of piped water, the following household-level<lb/> explanatory variables were included:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Since different types of connection are prone to different types of interruptions <ref type="biblio">[46]</ref>, type of<lb/> piped service (piped into dwelling, piped to neighbour, piped to yard/plot or public tap/<lb/> standpipe) was included as a covariate. Users may also consume more water if it is piped to<lb/> the yard or home, than if located further afield, such as at a neighbour&apos;s or a public tap/<lb/> standpipe <ref type="biblio">[47]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>• The DHS&apos;s urban/rural wealth index was used as a household wealth variable. This considers<lb/> assets and services owned by rural populations alongside those owned by urban populations<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[48]</ref>. Wealth relates to the type of piped service used <ref type="biblio">[49]</ref> and affects household vulnerability<lb/> to interruptions. The wealthier pay tariffs more regularly, are less exposed to illegal connec-<lb/>tions or pipeline breakages, can afford to consume more water <ref type="biblio">[50]</ref> and purchase storage<lb/> tanks which may protect from interruptions <ref type="biblio">[51]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Month of interview was included as a proxy for seasonal water shortages <ref type="biblio">[52]</ref>. Lower bore-<lb/>hole yields seasonally restrict groundwater-fed piped systems, while lower reservoir levels<lb/> seasonally affect piped networks drawing on surface waters <ref type="biblio">[53]</ref>. Date of interview was<lb/> grouped into categories to align with the April-September dry season in 2018/19 <ref type="biblio">[54]</ref> (dry<lb/> season: &apos;September 2018&apos;; &apos;July-August 2018&apos;, rainy season: &apos;October-November 2018&apos;;<lb/> &apos;December 2018-January 2019&apos;).<lb/></p>

			<p>• Belonging to a minority ethnic group may restrict water access, since for example, locations<lb/> of public standpipes and household connections to mains services often disproportionately<lb/> favour majority ethnic groups <ref type="biblio">[55]</ref>. Native language (English, Bemba, Lozi, Tonga, Kaonde/<lb/> Lunda/Luvale or other) was therefore included as a proxy for ethnicity.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Household size was included as it correlates with water consumption <ref type="biblio">[51, 56]</ref>, including<lb/> depletion rates of household stored water, ultimately affecting continuity. It also relates to<lb/> choice of service type <ref type="biblio">[57, 58]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Home ownership relates to the choice of water service and ability to cope with piped water<lb/> interruptions. For example, home-owners can choose to invest in a water tank as an<lb/> important coping strategy <ref type="biblio">[59]</ref>. Home ownership as reported by the men&apos;s and women&apos;s<lb/> DHS questionnaire respondents was included.<lb/></p>

			<p>At DHS household cluster level, we included the following variables:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Degree of urbanisation (classified as: urban centres/cities; urban clusters/towns/suburbs;<lb/> rural localities; and unpopulated) was included as a systematic review found lower reported<lb/> availability in rural settings <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. This DHS variable was derived from 2015 settlement data<lb/> from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project <ref type="biblio">[60]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Since recently urbanised areas may have water infrastructure that has undergone develop-<lb/>ment and is less prone to maintenance-related interruptions, we included change in urbani-<lb/>sation (less urbanised; more urbanised; no change), based on the difference in GHSL<lb/> settlement class between 1990 and 2015.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Neighbourhood wealth was included to reflect societal factors such as crime levels and disad-<lb/>vantaged communities <ref type="biblio">[61]</ref>, which in turn affect neighbourhood water infrastructure and<lb/> local capacity to cope with water intermittency. Cluster-level averages of the DHS&apos;s urban/<lb/> rural wealth index were created.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Newer neighbourhoods are less likely to have water infrastructure that is prone to failure,<lb/> due to general aging of materials and poor upkeep <ref type="biblio">[11, 62]</ref> and neighbourhoods comprising<lb/> newly arrived migrants may lack sufficient social cohesion to lobby for services <ref type="biblio">[63]</ref>. The<lb/> men&apos;s and women&apos;s DHS questionnaires ask respondents their length of residence in their<lb/> current home. As a proxy for the age of a cluster&apos;s neighbourhood and social cohesion, we<lb/> calculated the maximum length of residency for any men or women within a given cluster.<lb/></p>

			<p>Water service provider-level variables were as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>• Since local economic development affects investment in WASH infrastructure <ref type="biblio">[46, 64]</ref>, we<lb/> calculated GDP per capita at the service provider level. 2015 provincial GDP <ref type="biblio">[65]</ref> data were<lb/> converted to GDP per capita using 2015 provincial population statistics <ref type="biblio">[66]</ref> (<ref type="table">S7</ref> Table), esti-<lb/>mating this via areal interpolation for those service provider areas that did not match to pro-<lb/>vincial boundaries.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Non-revenue water was included to account for leakage or illegal use of piped networks <ref type="biblio">[40,<lb/> 41]</ref>. 2017 IBNET data which comprised the difference between water supplied and water<lb/> sold that is &apos;lost&apos; before it reaches the consumer, expressed as a percentage of net water sup-<lb/>plied <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Provider and regulator availability-reported average service hours expressed as hrs/day<lb/> and LCPCD were used and treated as continuous variables.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Stata 16.1 was used for all analysis <ref type="biblio">[67]</ref>. Initially, provider, regulator and user-reported avail-<lb/>ability were compared through scatter plots and calculation of Pearson&apos;s correlation coeffi-<lb/>cients. The LPCD measures reported by providers and the regulator were also assessed against<lb/> the WHO benchmark of �50 LPCD to estimate the proportion of population within each<lb/> PCA not meeting this benchmark.<lb/></p>

			<p>Descriptive and bivariate analysis for the outcome and explanatory variables, and associated<lb/> 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and chi-square tests, used household survey weights <ref type="biblio">[68]</ref> and<lb/> accounted for the complex survey design. Collinearity and missingness were examined for the<lb/> explanatory variables.<lb/></p>

			<p>Comparison of a single-level unconditional model and a two-level variance components<lb/> model quantified the clustering in the dataset, confirming the appropriateness of multilevel<lb/> models. Households (level 1) were nested in household clusters (level 2). Two final models<lb/> were specified. Model 1 included significant household and household cluster level variables,<lb/> and accounted for provider-level variation using dummy variables, as the small number of<lb/> PCAs (&lt;25) made it inappropriate to include the PCA as a level <ref type="biblio">[69]</ref>. Model 2 included signifi-<lb/>cant household, household cluster and provider explanatory variables. Backward elimination<lb/> with a significance threshold of p = 0.05 was used for both models and type of piped service<lb/> was retained as a control, despite not reaching this level of significance. An interaction term<lb/> was considered when a valid hypothesis existed and was subsequently deemed meaningful.<lb/> Survey weights were not used in the multilevel models, since the DHS only make weights avail-<lb/>able at the household level due to concerns about disclosure risk <ref type="biblio">[70]</ref>. Therefore, they were<lb/> unavailable at the household cluster or provider level, as was required for this analysis. Lastly,<lb/> random effects were added to the two models to calculate the proportion of variance within<lb/> household clusters that could not be attributed to observed variables.<lb/></p>

			<p>Issues of multicollinearity were found between regulator-and provider-reported LPCD or<lb/> service hours/day. Analysis found regulator and provider reporting for the same year (2017) to<lb/> be very similar for LPCD, and identical for hrs/day (see section entitled &apos;Data Sources and<lb/> Availability Metrics&apos;). Detailed analysis found a clear relationship between regulator LPCD in<lb/> 2017 and 2018 (<ref type="figure">S2</ref> Fig). LPCD was therefore used as the measure of availability. When com-<lb/>paring regulator and provider perspectives during initial descriptive analysis, 2017 data was<lb/> used for consistencies of the year. For all modelling however, to eliminate multicollinearity,<lb/> only 2018 regulator data was used as it matched the year of user-reported availability and<lb/> reflected the provider perspective.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<head>Comparison of provider, regulator and user availability<lb/></head>

			<p>In 2017, regulator records for service continuity (hrs/day) perfectly matched the provider data<lb/> reported to IBNET. No utilities reported a continuous service for 24 hrs/day, with households<lb/> receiving piped water for 18.4 hrs/day on average. The regulator and providers reported simi-<lb/>lar quantities of water supplied (in LPCD). Reported quantities were positively correlated (r s =<lb/> 0.86, p&lt;0.001), though higher average LPCD was reported by providers (<ref type="table">S16</ref> Table).<lb/></p>

			<p>2018 regulator-reported service continuity (hrs/day) is associated with user-reported avail-<lb/>ability at PCA level (χ(4) = 56.04, p&lt;0.001). Where the regulator reported continuity of 20<lb/> hrs/day, 54% of users reported interruptions. 2018 regulator LPCD and user-reported avail-<lb/>ability were associated (χ(9) = 220.63, p&lt;0.001), with evidence of a significant weak positive<lb/> correlation (r s = 0.05, p = 0.007). Where the regulator reported supplying �50 LPCD and sub-<lb/>sequently met the WHO benchmark, 55% of users reported an interruption to their supply.<lb/></p>

			<head>User-reported availability by provider coverage areas<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, 47% (95% CI: 44%, 49%) of users reported experiencing at least one full day of inter-<lb/>ruptions in the two weeks prior to being surveyed in 2018. The proportion of households<lb/> reporting an interruption ranged from 77% (95% CI: 71%, 82%) in Kafubu WSC to 19% (95%<lb/> CI: 15%, 24%) in Lukanga WSC (<ref type="table">S8</ref> Table). Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows 2018 user-reported availability along-<lb/>side regulator/provider-reported hrs/day. Only six of 177 household clusters had no household<lb/> reports of piped water interruptions. Lusaka WSC supplied piped drinking-water to 44% of<lb/> households in the sample. Southern WSC supplied a further 14% of sampled households. All<lb/> other WSCs provided drinking-water to between 2% and 9% of sampled households.<lb/></p>

			<head>Bivariate analysis of user-reported water availability<lb/></head>

			<p>1398 of 3047 households included in analysis reported an interruption to their service, with<lb/> the proportions of such households varying seasonally and by respondent&apos;s native language<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Neither household wealth, household size, home ownership nor type of piped service were<lb/> statistically significantly related to service interruptions (p&gt;0.05). Month of interview was sig-<lb/>nificantly associated with interruptions to drinking-water service (p&lt;0.05), as was native lan-<lb/>guage (p&lt;0.05). As expected, type of piped service was significantly associated with household<lb/> wealth (p&lt;0.01). 68% of households in the richest wealth quintile had a piped service into<lb/> their dwelling, compared to 2% in the poorest wealth quintile. 45% of those in the poorest<lb/> wealth quintile used a public standpipe/tap compared to less than 1% in the richest wealth<lb/> quintile.<lb/></p>

			<p>At the household cluster level, only degree of urbanisation and maximum length of resi-<lb/>dency were significantly associated with interruptions (p&lt;0.01) (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). The relationship<lb/> was non-linear, with reported water interruptions lowest at 32.2% for clusters with a<lb/></p>

			<head>Multi-level logistic regression<lb/></head>

			<p>Table <ref type="table">4</ref> includes the multi-level logistic regression results for two models. Model 1 includes<lb/> selected household and household cluster factors that explain inequalities in piped-water inter-<lb/>ruptions with provider accounted for via dummy variables. Model 2 shows the association<lb/> between socioeconomic characteristics at the household, household cluster and provider-level<lb/> and the likelihood of households reporting an interruption.<lb/> When provider is accounted for in model 1, type of piped service is not significant, whereas<lb/> in model 2 it is. Households using a neighbour&apos;s water had 33% greater odds of reporting an<lb/> interruption than those with water piped to their dwelling (p&lt;0.1). In model 1, households<lb/> interviewed at the peak of the dry season had 1.91 times the odds of an interruption than those<lb/> interviewed in the middle of the rainy season (p&lt;0.05). In model 2, households interviewed<lb/> outside the wettest months of December-January had 2-3 times the odds of experiencing an<lb/> interruption (p&lt;0.05).<lb/></p>

			<p>In both models, household ownership is significantly associated with experiencing an inter-<lb/>ruption. The odds of experiencing an interruption were 1.31-1.32 times higher for those that<lb/> at least partly owned their home (p&lt;0.001). Availability of services varies significantly with<lb/> household native language. In both models, those who speak Luvale/Kaonde/Lunda have<lb/> greater odds of experiencing an interruption than English speaking households (p&lt;0.05).<lb/> When accounting for provider, compared to English speaking households, Tonga speakers<lb/> were 1.78 times more likely to have an interruption (p&lt;0.1) whereas in model 2, Bemba speak-<lb/>ing households had 1.88 time the odds (p&lt;0.1).<lb/></p>

			<p>Households in neighbourhoods classed as having mid-level wealth had 4.31 times the odds<lb/> of experiencing an interruption than those in poor neighbourhoods (p&lt;0.01) (model 2).<lb/> Neighbourhood wealth was found to interact with regulator-reported service availability.<lb/> Compared to poor clusters, for every one litre increase in regulator reported LPCD, house-<lb/>holds in mid-wealth clusters had 3% lower odds of reporting an interruption (p&lt;0.05).<lb/></p>

			<p>GDP per capita is the only provider-level factor associated with household availability<lb/> (model 2). For each $1000 increase in GDP per capita, the odds of reporting an interruption<lb/> are 0.51 times less (p&lt;0.01). GDP per capita at service provider level interacts with regulator-<lb/>reported LPCD. For every one unit increase in regulator-reported LPCD and GDP per capita<lb/> at service provider level, the odds of having an interruption were 1.02 times greater (p&lt;0.01).<lb/></p>

			<p>Substantial variations between providers are evident when controlling for home ownership,<lb/> type of piped service, month of interview and native language (model 1). When comparing the<lb/> odds of households reporting an interruption to areas supplied by Lusaka WSC, households<lb/> supplied by Lukanga WSC had 64% lower odds of experiencing an interruption (p&lt;0.05)<lb/> whilst in Nkana the odds were 2.24 times higher (p&lt;0.05) and Mulongo WSC 3.77 times<lb/> higher (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, in Chambeshi WSC the odds of having an interruption were 2.43<lb/> times higher (p&lt;0.05) and in Luapula they were 2.89 (p&lt;0.05). In Kafubu WSC, households<lb/> have eightfold increased odds of reporting experiencing an interruption than those whose pro-<lb/>vision is from Lusaka WSC (p&lt;0.01).<lb/></p>

			<p>The variability in households&apos; likelihood of experiencing an interruption that was not<lb/> explained by the household and household cluster factors used in the multilevel models was exam-<lb/>ined through the Intra-Class Correlation (ICC). The ICC for model 1 shows that 27% of the<lb/> remaining unexplained variation in reported interruptions lies between household clusters, whilst<lb/> 73% lies within household clusters. In model 2, 31% of the variation lies between clusters whereas<lb/> 69% is within clusters. These results suggest that between a quarter and a third of the likelihood of<lb/> experiencing an interruption is related to the cluster that someone lives in, with the remainder<lb/> due to the specific household, after accounting for the variables within the models.<lb/></p>

			<head>Insights into equalities in piped water continuity through integrated<lb/> analysis of survey, regulator, and provider data sets<lb/></head>

			<p>Integrated analysis of utility, regulator, and household survey data provides some insights into<lb/> inequalities and risk factors for piped water continuity in urban Zambia that would not be<lb/> apparent from analysing any one data set in isolation. There are few statistically significant<lb/> inequalities at the household level (<ref type="table">S17</ref> Table, Model 2) and significant cluster-and provider-<lb/>level predictors. After controlling for household characteristics, this nationally representative<lb/> analysis of urban DHS data highlights provider-level inequality in service continuity (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>)<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. 19% of households reported an interruption in Lukanga, compared to 77% in Kafubu<lb/> WSC (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), with Kafubu, Mulongo, and several other WSCs having significantly higher<lb/> odds of household-reported interruptions relative to Lusaka after controlling for household<lb/> characteristics (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Similarly, a study <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> comparing DHS with IBNET for Peruvian<lb/> regions also found high inter-provider and inter-province intermittency, with lower house-<lb/>hold-reported intermittency in Lima, the capital, than most other regions. Whilst there is<lb/> some tentative evidence in our models that such provider-level variation in water continuity<lb/> may relate to utility operational indicators such as LPCD, this variation is also associated with<lb/> regional socio-economic variation such as in GDP per capita (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>Alongside provider-level patterns, variation in household-reported water continuity is evi-<lb/>dent at the household and household cluster level (Tables <ref type="table">2 &amp; 4</ref>). Regulatory reports and pro-<lb/>vider performance databases such as IBNET do not differentiate the level of service provided<lb/> to different household groups within their PCAs. However, it is known that ethnic minorities,<lb/> the poor, and other disadvantaged groups may receive poorer quality services <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. In this<lb/> analysis, we integrated PCA boundaries with household survey data to examine such inequali-<lb/>ties. We find some evidence of urban inequalities in the availability of piped water services in<lb/> relation to ethnicity (measured via native language), home ownership and seasonality, but not<lb/> household wealth. We find no significant evidence that such inequalities vary between PCAs.<lb/> Key findings concerning household-and cluster-level risk factors were as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>• We found native English speakers less likely to report interruptions compared to respon-<lb/>dents speaking all other native languages. This could reflect the regional distribution of eth-<lb/>nicity in relation to service availability. Ethnicity is an important factor contributing to water<lb/> inequalities globally, with indigenous populations comprising 15% of the world&apos;s poor <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Households in mid-wealth clusters were less likely to experience an interruption than those<lb/> in poor clusters. This could reflect households in wealthier neighbourhoods adopting<lb/></p>

			<p>protective measures against interruptions <ref type="biblio">[10, 71]</ref> and having greater capacity to address ser-<lb/>vice network failures.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Counter to our hypothesis, we found households who owned their home were more likely to<lb/> experience interruptions than those that did not.<lb/></p>

			<p>• Households using a neighbour&apos;s piped water also had higher odds of experiencing an inter-<lb/>ruption than those with water piped to their dwelling. This could reflect household reluc-<lb/>tance to sell their water to neighbours during times of water scarcity.<lb/></p>

			<p>• As suggested by other authors <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>, reported water continuity varied seasonally, with house-<lb/>holds interviewed in peak rainy season having lower odds of reporting an interruption<lb/> (Tables <ref type="table">1 and 4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Although multi-country analyses suggest exposure to microbially contaminated or inade-<lb/>quately chlorinated water is often greater among poorer households <ref type="biblio">[72, 73]</ref>, we found Zam-<lb/>bian households in both poor and wealthy clusters were more exposed to water interruptions<lb/> relative to those in mid-wealth clusters. Criteria concerning availability and water safety may<lb/> therefore affect socio-economic inequalities in access to safely managed water services.<lb/></p>

			<head>Comparability and consistency of survey versus provider and regulatory<lb/> data<lb/></head>

			<p>It is clear the data landscape is complex, which is exacerbated by the contrasting approaches to<lb/> measuring availability <ref type="biblio">[14, 15]</ref>. The extent of our analysis has been limited due to the use of<lb/> two very different metrics of availability: regulator and provider reported yearly mean service<lb/> hours or LPCD, whilst DHS household survey respondents reported service interruptions in<lb/> the past fortnight.<lb/></p>

			<p>Despite this, we find household survey reporting is correlated with provider/regulator<lb/> reporting (<ref type="table">S17</ref> Table). Differences existed between provider and regulator reporting depend-<lb/>ing on the metric in question, however generally they are highly consistent with one another<lb/> (<ref type="table">S16</ref> Table). This is as expected given NWASCO regulator reports use provider data, but the<lb/> use of regulator data is preferable for monitoring, given regulator independence from service<lb/> provision and incentives for providers to report higher service continuity <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In linking household survey, regulator and provider data sets to evaluate their consistency,<lb/> we adopted a different approach to a previous study in Peru <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. This study aggregated data<lb/> for PCAs to region level and compared household-and regulator-reported metrics at the<lb/> region level. In contrast, we used multi-level modelling to assess whether contextual provider-<lb/>or regulator-reported water continuity metrics were associated with household-level reports of<lb/> service interruptions. Our approach thus enables simultaneous evaluation of provider-level<lb/> versus household-level risk factors for supply interruptions, whilst avoiding the known prob-<lb/>lems of areal aggregation <ref type="biblio">[74]</ref>. Particularly for larger service providers, our approach also pro-<lb/>vides insights into intra-provider socio-economic inequalities in access to an uninterrupted<lb/> water service via household reports collected independent of the service provider (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Limitations affecting Zambia study<lb/></head>

			<p>This analysis only captures household respondents who report an interruption of at least one<lb/> full day in the two weeks prior to being surveyed. As such, recall bias will likely exist in the<lb/> user data <ref type="biblio">[75]</ref> whereby respondents may fail to remember or misremember interruptions in<lb/> their service. For example, respondents using a 2-week recall period systematically under-<lb/>reported child diarrhoea relative to a 1-week period <ref type="biblio">[76]</ref>. Additionally, respondents who<lb/> spend more time away from their homes may be unaware of short duration outages. Thus,<lb/> there are likely to be households who experience shorter-and longer-term service interrup-<lb/>tions, that are not captured in household survey data. Source of drinking-water and water used<lb/> for other purposes form inputs to the DHS wealth index, but not reported supply interrup-<lb/>tions. This complicates WASH inequality analyses <ref type="biblio">[77]</ref> and could have increased collinearity<lb/> between the wealth index and source type in our models, but we did not find empirical evi-<lb/>dence for this.<lb/></p>

			<p>The quality of provider and regulator data depends greatly on the accuracy of the data<lb/> reported by each WSC <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. Data supplied by providers may be of limited reliability as they<lb/> may lack any form of independent verification <ref type="biblio">[78]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Between datasets, definitional differences existed in the classification of urban/rural areas<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[31, 34]</ref>. Households were excluded based on the DHS urban/rural classification, despite the<lb/> regulator or provider potentially classifying them as urban. Additionally, given the DHS used a<lb/> 2010 rural/urban classification <ref type="biblio">[34, 79]</ref>, it is likely that some rural areas may have become<lb/> urbanised. The issue of differing classifications is exacerbated by the use of GHSL population<lb/> data to create cluster-level locality and change in urbanisation variables. GHSL data uses a<lb/> finer spatial scale classification <ref type="biblio">[80]</ref> that differs to the DHS classification. Thus, despite exclud-<lb/>ing all rural households from the analysis, inconsistencies between datasets are evident. For<lb/> both variables, some household clusters are classified as rural or unpopulated areas, despite the<lb/> DHS classifying them as urban. This could also be a result of the DHS&apos;s displacement of house-<lb/>hold cluster locations <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref>, though the effect is likely minimal as GPS clusters were not dis-<lb/>placed across province boundaries and WSCs are coincident with provinces.<lb/></p>

			<p>The higher-level explanatory variables for wealth also have limitations. The neighbourhood<lb/> wealth variable was calculated by aggregating household-level DHS wealth index values to<lb/> household cluster level. This will however mean that closely located extreme differences in<lb/> wealth are unaccounted for. The provincial wealth variable used provincial GDP data that is<lb/> based on where industries produce their goods or where their head office is located. Therefore,<lb/> the data may not be a true representation of wealth in each PCA <ref type="biblio">[65]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Additional explanatory variables were considered for analysis, including &apos;voice&apos; <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>, gender<lb/> of the person collecting water <ref type="biblio">[81]</ref>, storage tank ownership <ref type="biblio">[82]</ref> and blue water scarcity <ref type="biblio">[83]</ref>.<lb/> In all instances, inclusion was not possible as there was either no available data, limited vari-<lb/>ability across Zambia or reasonable proxies did not exist.<lb/></p>

			<head>Barriers to methodological transferability<lb/></head>

			<p>Our integrated analysis of household survey and water utility databases highlights data-related<lb/> barriers at present to methodological transferability at both international and national level. In<lb/> the context of Zambia, comparison has been made possible by a relatively simple data land-<lb/>scape, where PCAs largely coincide with DHS regions. At present, exploring inequalities else-<lb/>where via this methodology would only be possible in countries where household surveys have<lb/> measured service interruptions and for WSCs serving large populations, with known geo-<lb/>graphic coverage areas. Given that household survey cluster coordinates are randomly dis-<lb/>placed to preserve confidentiality <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>, misallocation of households to providers is more likely<lb/> where PCAs are small. Thus, our approach is more suited to countries with several large-scale<lb/> water service providers, as opposed to countries dominated by small-scale providers or a single<lb/> national provider (e.g. Ghana Water Company Limited). Elsewhere, the availability of data<lb/> from all three streams is currently restricted to eastern and southern Africa (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref> and <ref type="figure">S1</ref> Fig;<lb/> <ref type="table">S1-S3</ref> Tables), but analysis will become possible in more countries as data availability<lb/> increases. By 2030, the data landscape may change considerably with greater availability of<lb/> household survey data on water service continuity, from government via regulators, from utili-<lb/>ties as service providers and potentially other new forms of data such as via social media or<lb/> sensors <ref type="biblio">[84]</ref>. Therefore, whilst the current transferability of methods is reliant on present-day<lb/> data availability, as monitoring expands, the applicability and transferability of this analysis<lb/> may broaden.<lb/></p>

			<p>Within Zambia, data were only available for urban and peri-urban services from the pro-<lb/>vider and regulator, which limited the scope of this analysis to include only the urban and<lb/> peri-urban third of the Zambian population. Compared to user data which has national cover-<lb/>age, both datasets only include the population served by large-scale reporting commercial utili-<lb/>ties and may exclude services from small-scale private schemes/companies <ref type="biblio">[85]</ref>, micro-<lb/>operators managing delegated services <ref type="biblio">[86]</ref>, and community-managed piped services <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Implications for international monitoring<lb/></head>

			<p>The JMP only makes estimates for safely managed drinking-water when there are data avail-<lb/>able on water quality and at least one other element (accessibility or availability) that repre-<lb/>sents at least half of the population in question (e.g. country) <ref type="biblio">[87]</ref>. The development of<lb/> methods which could help to reach this criterion threshold, for example by using data from<lb/> multiple perspectives, will be critical in better analysing WASH for international agendas such<lb/> as the SDGs. Improvements in data, coupled with a standardised process by which data are<lb/> processed to give nationally representative and internationally comparable insights into drink-<lb/>ing-water availability are needed, especially in order to understand inequalities between popu-<lb/>lation groups <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Definitions of provider-reported average service hours requires further clarity. For exam-<lb/>ple, does it represent the hours a pump in a piped network is operated or the average duration<lb/> of service households receive? Several suggestions have been made to address this, such as reg-<lb/>ular random household surveys by providers or the use of sensors to detect outages <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. At<lb/> present, provider reporting of hrs/day is unclear and it is unknown what the number of days<lb/> between service is.<lb/></p>

			<p>We recommend further smaller scale studies of drinking-water availability. Whilst our anal-<lb/>ysis bears similarities to Rawas et al. <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> in its regional/provincial analysis, future work that<lb/> resonates more closely with Bellaubi et al.&apos;s <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref> finer scale case study analysis would give<lb/> more detailed understanding of the availability of piped services. To achieve this, we recom-<lb/>mend providers and regulators report availability for smaller geographical units so that house-<lb/>holds can be better matched with provider jurisdictions. This would also be enhanced by<lb/> utilities providing their service areas as coverage area boundaries to IBNET to facilitate data<lb/> integration. Additionally, a future multi-country study could potentially explore other IBNET-<lb/>derived management indicators (e.g. concerning staff training or adequacy infra-structure<lb/> investment <ref type="biblio">[88]</ref>) alongside those relating to service availability. However, care would be<lb/> needed to control for other regional covariates that could explain water service continuity,<lb/> such as regional GDP.<lb/></p>

			<p>Greater uptake of the JMP&apos;s expanded WASH questions by national statistical agencies via<lb/> household surveys, such as the DHS, would facilitate further, more widespread evaluation of<lb/> regulator and provider data concerning water availability. Alongside the DHS question ana-<lb/>lysed in our study, these expanded questions also include asking households &apos;how many hours<lb/> per day is water supplied on average?&apos; <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. Whilst uptake such questions depends on survey<lb/> implementation resources and national priorities <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>, it would enable direct comparison with<lb/> regulator and provider reporting of service availability via a metric common to all data<lb/> sources.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>This study demonstrates the additional insights into risk factors associated with piped drink-<lb/>ing-water availability by incorporating utility and regulatory data into household survey analy-<lb/>sis for urban and peri-urban Zambia. At household and household cluster (neighbourhood)<lb/> level, when adjusting for confounders through multi-level modelling, inequalities are minimal.<lb/> Wealth was the only neighbourhood risk factor found to influence service availability. At the<lb/> household level, home ownership, month of interview, native language and type of service had<lb/> a modest effect. At provider-level, inequalities between PCAs were found in household report-<lb/>ing of interruptions to services.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our analysis builds on existing assessments of drinking-water services <ref type="biblio">[11, 18]</ref> by including<lb/> the additional perspective of the regulator. We find correlations between user, provider and<lb/> regulator reports of service availability, but direct comparison is difficult, due to variations in<lb/> availability metrics used. Limited data availability also restricts more widespread, integrated<lb/> analyses of these data in rural areas and across SSA. Moving forward, greater availability of<lb/> water service continuity data from all three data sources should enable assessment of socio-<lb/>economic and geographic inequalities in access to uninterrupted water services and potential<lb/> for understanding how water management indicators relate to household-related interruptions<lb/> in a wider set of countries. However, more widespread, integrated use of utility or regulator<lb/> data requires investment in government monitoring of intermittency in small-scale commu-<lb/>nity supplies to better understand rural service access. It also requires investment in utility cov-<lb/>erage area map layers to facility spatial data integration with household surveys.<lb/></p>
