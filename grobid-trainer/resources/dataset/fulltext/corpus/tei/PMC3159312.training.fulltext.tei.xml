			<p>Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic human pathogen<lb/> responsible for diseases such as allergic reactions and<lb/> lung infections, including bronchopulmonary aspergillosis<lb/> (ABPA) and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) <ref type="biblio">[1, 2]</ref>.<lb/> This fungus is a significant health threat to immunocom-<lb/>promised patients, such as organ transplant recipients and<lb/> people with AIDS or leukemia <ref type="biblio">[3, 4]</ref>. It has been reported<lb/> that IPA infections are typically accompanied by a mortality<lb/> rate of 50-70% <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. Thus, identification of novel and effective<lb/> drug targets is essential in the fight against fungal infections.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recently, the biosynthetic pathway of galactofuranose<lb/> (Galf ), the 5-membered ring form of galactose, has been<lb/> described in A. fumigatus. Galf is a component of the cell wall<lb/> of A. fumigatus and plays an important role in virulence <ref type="biblio">[6-<lb/>8]</ref>. In A. fumigatus, Galf was first identified as a component<lb/> of galactomannan by immunodetection in IPA patients <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>.<lb/> Later, it was found that Galf is also a major component<lb/> of saccharide structures in membrane lipids and glycosyl<lb/> phosphoinositol (GPI-)anchored lipophospholipids <ref type="biblio">[10, 11]</ref>.<lb/> UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM) is a flavoenzyme that<lb/> catalyzes the conversion of UDP-galactopyranose (UDP-<lb/>Galp) to UDP-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), the<lb/> biosynthetic precursor of Galf <ref type="biblio">[7, 12]</ref>. Deletion of the A.<lb/> fumigatus UGM (Af UGM) gene results in mutant fungi<lb/> with attenuated virulence, a decrease in cell wall thickness,<lb/> and an increase in the sensitivity to antifungal agents<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[8, 13]</ref>. Moreover, Galf is absent in humans <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. Thus,<lb/> inhibitors of Af UGM that block the biosynthesis of Galf<lb/> represent attractive drug targets for the identification of<lb/> novel therapeutics against A. fumigatus.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here, we describe the development of a fluorescence<lb/> polarization (FP) binding assay to identify specific Af UGM<lb/> inhibitors. Four fluorescently labeled UDP derivatives<lb/> including two known UDP-fluorescein analogs (1 and 2,<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and two novel UDP-TAMRA analogs (3 and 4,<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) were synthesized to be used as fluorescent probes<lb/> in the FP assay. Their concentrations were optimized to<lb/> obtain a stable FP signal with minimal standard deviation,<lb/> and their K d values were determined by measuring the<lb/> anisotropy changes as a function of Af UGM concentration.<lb/></p>

			<p>We found that the UDP-TAMRA analogs bind to Af UGM<lb/> 6-fold tighter than the UDP-fluorescein analogs, suggesting<lb/> that UDP-TAMRA analogs are better fluorescent probes for<lb/> this enzyme. UDP-TAMRA probes could be competed out<lb/> by UDP, a known ligand of UGMs, and the K d value of UDP<lb/> was in good agreement with the value determined previously<lb/> in a fluorescence assay <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>. Furthermore, the FP assay was<lb/> validated using several known ligands and displayed an<lb/> excellent Z factor (0.79 ± 0.02) and good tolerance to<lb/> DMSO. Therefore, this fast convenient one-step FP assay is<lb/> suitable for a high-throughput screening to identify Af UGM<lb/> inhibitors.<lb/></p>

			<p>All chemicals were obtained from commercial<lb/> sources and were used without further purification. Anhy-<lb/>drous reactions were performed under argon. All solvents<lb/> were either reagent grade or HPLC grade. NMR spectral<lb/> data were obtained using a JEOL Eclipse spectrometer at<lb/> 500 MHz, or a Varian Inova spectrometer at 400 MHz.<lb/> Chemical shifts were reported as δ-values relative to known<lb/> solvent residue peaks. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS)<lb/> were obtained in the Mass Spec Incubator, Department<lb/> of Biochemistry, Virginia Tech. High-performance liquid<lb/> chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a C18 reverse<lb/> phase column (Phenomenex Luna C18 column, 250 ×<lb/> 21.20 mm, 5 microns) using water and acetonitrile as the<lb/> elution solvents. All compounds were more than 95% pure<lb/> as judged by HPLC and 1 H NMR.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Af UGM activity assay was<lb/> performed by monitoring the formation of UDP-Galp from<lb/> UDP-Galf by HPLC. A 20 μL reaction containing 20 mM<lb/> dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM UDP-Galf in 25 mM HEPES, 125 mM<lb/> NaCl buffer, pH 7.5 in the absence of 7 or 8 was initiated<lb/> by the addition of Af UGM at a final concentration of<lb/> 50 nM. After incubation at 37 • C for 10 min, the reaction<lb/> was quenched by heat denaturation (95 • C for 5 min) in a<lb/> DNA engine thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, Calif, USA).<lb/> The same reaction was also performed in the presence<lb/> of 7 (500 μM) or 8 (50 μM). The suspension was cen-<lb/>trifuged and the supernatant was injected onto a CarboPac<lb/> PA100 (Dionex) anion-exchange column. The sample was<lb/> eluted isocratically with 75 mM KH 2 PO 4 (pH 4.5), and the<lb/> absorbance at 262 nm was monitored to identify fractions of<lb/> substrate and product. The substrate UDP-Galf was eluted at<lb/> 36.5 min, and the product UDP-Galp was eluted at 28.3 min.<lb/> The inhibition of Af UGM activity was indicated by the<lb/> extent of conversion of UDP-Galf to UDP-Galp.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.11. Tolerance to DMSO. </head>
				
			<p>To determine the tolerance of<lb/> the assay to DMSO, solutions containing 2 μM of Af UGM,<lb/> 15 nM of chromophore 3, and DMSO at various concen-<lb/>trations in the absence (negative control) and presence<lb/> (positive control) of 300 μM of UDP were incubated at room<lb/> temperature for 5 minutes.

			<head>3. Results and Discussion<lb/> </head>
				
			<head>3.1. Assay Design and Optimization. </head>
				
			<p>In this study, we report<lb/> the development of an FP assay that can be used in a high-<lb/>throughput format for the identification of inhibitors of<lb/> Af UGM, which we believe will lead to the development<lb/> of new therapeutics against A. fumigatus-related diseases.<lb/> The FP assay was designed as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. If the<lb/> UDP fluorescent probe binds to Af UGM and is excited with<lb/> plane-polarized light, the resulting enzyme-ligand complex<lb/> tumbles slowly in solution, and thus, the fluorescence<lb/> emission remains polarized (Figure <ref type="figure">3(a)</ref>). Otherwise, the<lb/> emission will be depolarized as the free chromophore will<lb/> rotate rapidly. The change in the rotational motion between<lb/> the bound and free chromophore can be used as a signal<lb/> for detection of the binding of small molecules to the active<lb/> site of Af UGM because, as the small molecule replaces<lb/> the bound fluorescent probe, the free probe will rapidly<lb/> rotate increasing the amount of depolarized fluorescence<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">3(b)</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>An essential component of an FP assay is a fluorescent<lb/> probe that specifically binds to the enzyme or protein of<lb/> interest. To design the fluorescent probe, we reasoned that<lb/> the incorporation of the UDP moiety into the structure<lb/> would target binding to the Af UGM active site since it<lb/> is a major part of the UGM substrate. The fluorophore<lb/> we first selected was fluorescein because UDP-fluorescein<lb/></p>

			<p>derivatives have been found to bind to prokaryotic UGMs<lb/> from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. To minimize the steric hindrance of fluorescein with<lb/> Af UGM binding site residues, UDP and fluorescein were<lb/> connected with alkyl linkers of different lengths, which<lb/> resulted in two UDP-fluorescein analogs (1 and 2, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/> We also designed a UDP bound to the chromophore, com-<lb/>mercially known as TAMRA (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This chromophore<lb/> offers several advantages over fluorescein. First, TAMRA is<lb/> more resistant to photobleaching compared to fluorescein<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. Second, the fluorescence emission of TAMRA does<lb/> not overlap with that of the flavin cofactor in Af UGM.<lb/> Fluorescein is typically excited at 494 nm and emits at<lb/> 520 nm, which significantly overlaps with the absorbance<lb/> and fluorescence emission of the flavin. In contrast, TAMRA&apos;s<lb/> absorbance and fluorescence maxima is at 546 nm and 580<lb/> nm, respectively <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. This is significantly different from<lb/> the flavin absorbance/emission properties and improves<lb/> signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, in comparison with fluorescein,<lb/> TAMRA has one extra positive charge, which we believe<lb/> increases the interaction between TAMRA and flavin and<lb/> helps improve binding of the probe to Af UGM. Alkyl linkers<lb/> of different lengths were also included to minimize the steric<lb/> interaction of TAMRA with the binding site residues, giving<lb/> two novel UDP-TAMRA analogs (3 and 4, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, stable FP<lb/> values are necessary. Therefore, we varied the concentration<lb/> of UDP-chromophores to determine the optimal concentra-<lb/>tion (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Stable FP values with minimal standard devi-<lb/>ation were obtained at concentrations higher than 15 nM.<lb/> Therefore, we chose the 15 nM UDP-chromophore as the<lb/> minimal concentration to use for further characterization.<lb/></p>

			<p>determined by varying the concentration of the enzyme at a<lb/> constant concentration of the UDP-chromophores (15 nM)<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Binding assays with the UDP-fluorescein probes<lb/> (chromophores 1 and 2) show that these ligands bind<lb/> weakly to Af UGM, with K d values of ∼15 μM (Figure <ref type="figure">5(a)</ref>).<lb/> This relatively low affinity impedes the utilization of these<lb/> chromophores for a high-throughput FP binding assay, as<lb/> it will require high quantities of enzyme. Interestingly, we<lb/> tested the binding of these chromophores to bacterial UGM<lb/> from M. tuberculosis, and the K d value of chromophore 2 was<lb/> 0.10 ± 0.01 μM, consistent with previously published values<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. This tighter binding suggests differences in<lb/> the active-site architecture between the prokaryotic and<lb/> A. fumigatus UGM enzymes. This is also consistent with<lb/> our recent report on binding assays monitoring flavin<lb/> fluorescence that showed that Af UGM binds UDP-glucose<lb/> 5 times tighter than K. pneumoniae UGM. Similarly, binding<lb/> of UDP-Galp to Af UGM was not detected although UDP-<lb/>Galp binds to the bacterial enzyme with a K d value of<lb/> 220 μM <ref type="biblio">[7, 17]</ref>. These differences in ligand binding might<lb/> originate from the low amino acid identity between the<lb/> bacterial and eukaryotic UGMs (&lt;18%). Furthermore, we<lb/> have shown that the quaternary structure between these<lb/> enzymes is not conserved as the bacterial enzymes have been<lb/> shown to function as homodimers, while Af UGM functions<lb/> as a homotetramer <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the UDP-TAMRA analogs (chromophores 3 and 4),<lb/> the binding to Af UGM was ∼6 times better than with the<lb/> UDP-fluorescein analogs, and significant anisotropy change<lb/></p>

			<p>was measured (Figure <ref type="figure">5(b)</ref>). Interestingly, the length of<lb/> the linker had little or no effect on the binding affinities<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), suggesting that with Af UGM the interaction<lb/> between the chromophore and some components of the<lb/> active site or perhaps directly with the flavin cofactor play a<lb/> major role in binding. Compound 3 and 4 bound to MtUGM<lb/> with similar affinities as chromophores 1 and 2, respectively.<lb/> In contrast to Af UGM, in the bacterial enzymes, the length<lb/> of the linker plays a major role in binding with longer<lb/> linkers increasing the affinity, further demonstrating that the<lb/> active-site architecture varied among the UGM enzymes. We<lb/> selected 3 as the FP probe for further characterization of the<lb/> binding assay.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3. Determination of Competitive Binding Using FP Assay.<lb/> </head>
				
			<p>FP competitive inhibition binding assay was conducted to<lb/> confirm that the FP probes bind to the active site on Af UGM.<lb/> First, the Z factor as a function of Af UGM was determined<lb/> to establish the proper enzyme concentration to be used in<lb/> the assay. The Z factor is a statistical parameter that reports<lb/> on the quality of the assay <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>, the FP<lb/> assay exhibits excellent quality at an Af UGM concentration<lb/> higher than 2 μM with a Z factor above 0.8. The minimum<lb/> value (2 μM) in this range was selected as the optimal assay<lb/> concentration.<lb/></p>

			<p>The K d for UDP was determined using the FP assay by<lb/> titrating Af UGM with serial dilutions of UDP. A value of<lb/> 9.0 ± 1.7 μM was obtained, which is in good agreement<lb/> with the K d (33 ± 9 μM) previously determined by directly<lb/> monitoring the flavin fluorescence (Figure <ref type="figure">7(a)</ref>) <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>UDP-Galp was the second ligand tested in the FP<lb/> inhibition assay, and a K d value of 495 ± 66 μM was<lb/> calculated (Figure <ref type="figure">7(b)</ref>), indicating that UDP-Galp is a poor<lb/> ligand for Af UGM, which agrees well with the observation<lb/> previously reported by Oppenheimer et al. <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recently, a series of prokaryotic UGM inhibitors were<lb/> identified from chemical libraries by high-throughput<lb/> screening (HTS) <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. In our FP assay, we tested two of<lb/> the best prokaryotic UGM inhibitors, compound 7 and<lb/> compound 8 (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Interestingly, they behaved differ-<lb/>ently on Af UGM. Compound 7 turned out to be a poor<lb/> ligand for Af UGM with a K d of 140 ± 9 μM (Figure <ref type="figure">9(a)</ref>).<lb/> In contrast, compound 8 exhibits much better binding to<lb/> Af UGM (Figure <ref type="figure">9(b)</ref>), and its K d was found to be 11<lb/> ± 0.4 μM (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). We also tested these two compounds<lb/> in a secondary assay, directly monitoring the activity of<lb/> Af UGM to see if these molecules function as inhibitors. The<lb/> HPLC chromatograms (Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>) indicated that both of the<lb/> compounds inhibit the activity of Af UGM. These results<lb/> confirm that the FP assay identifies ligands that bind to the<lb/> active site of Af UGM and that these molecules inhibit the<lb/> activity of the enzyme in a secondary assay that directly<lb/> measures product formation.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4. FP Assay Quality. </head>
				
			<p>The Z factor value using chro-<lb/>mophore 3 was calculated to be 0.79 ± 0.02. An assay with<lb/> a Z factor greater than 0.5 is considered a good assay;<lb/> therefore, our FP assay is suitable for HTS (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). We<lb/> also estimated the tolerance of the FP assay to DMSO by<lb/> calculating the Z factors at various DMSO concentrations,<lb/> because a majority of compounds in HTS libraries are<lb/> dissolved in DMSO. The Z factors were plotted against<lb/> DMSO concentrations to generate a DMSO calibration curve<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">11</ref>), and our assay maintains excellent quality with<lb/> DMSO concentration up to 5% (v/v).<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>In conclusion, four fluorescently labeled UDP derivatives<lb/> (1-4) were synthesized and tested for binding to Af UGM.<lb/> Different from the bacterial UGM, the nature of the chro-<lb/>mophore enhanced binding to AfUGM while the length of<lb/> the linkers did not. UDP-TAMRA analogs (3 and 4) bind to<lb/> Af UGM with high affinities. Binding of chromophore 3 to<lb/> the active site of Af UGM was demonstrated by a competi-<lb/>tion experiment using UDP and UDP-Galp. Furthermore,<lb/> binding of known inhibitors of bacterial UGM was tested<lb/> against Af UGM, and it was found that these compounds<lb/> bound Af UGM, however, with lower affinities. Inhibition<lb/> of Af UGM, measuring product formation by HPLC, was<lb/> demonstrated with compounds 7 and 8. A Z factor of 0.79<lb/> was calculated, and the assay was shown to exhibit good<lb/> tolerance to DMSO. We expect that the FP assay described<lb/> here will allow fast identification of Af UGM inhibitors from<lb/> chemical libraries. We believe that inhibitors of Af UGM<lb/> that block the biosynthesis of Galf could lead to novel<lb/> therapeutics against A. fumigatus-related diseases.</p>
