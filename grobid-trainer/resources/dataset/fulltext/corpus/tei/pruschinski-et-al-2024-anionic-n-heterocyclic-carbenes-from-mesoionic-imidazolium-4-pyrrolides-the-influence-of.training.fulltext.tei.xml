            <p>Certainly triggered by the isolation of the first stable<lb/> representative of this substance class by Arduengo in 1991, <ref type="biblio">1<lb/></ref> intensive research has been carried out in the field of N-<lb/>heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) for more than three decades. <ref type="biblio">2<lb/></ref> Today, it is impossible to imagine modern synthetic chemistry,<lb/> which applies transition metal-catalyzed cross-couplings <ref type="biblio">3</ref><lb/> including asymmetric reactions, <ref type="biblio">4</ref> organocatalytic steps, <ref type="biblio">5</ref> or<lb/> polymer chemistry <ref type="biblio">6</ref> without them, to name just a few selected<lb/> subdisciplines of chemistry. In addition, numerous biological<lb/> activities of NHC adducts have been found. <ref type="biblio">7</ref> In the course of<lb/> this research, interesting structural variations with respect to<lb/> the underlying heterocyclic ring system, different substitution<lb/> patterns and types of carbenes such as normal, abnormal,<lb/> remote NHCs, <ref type="biblio">8</ref> mesoionic carbenes (MIC) <ref type="biblio">9</ref> and cyclic alkyl<lb/> amino carbenes (CAAC) <ref type="biblio">10</ref> have been studied and applied. A<lb/> number of approaches have also been developed to quantify<lb/> the properties of N-heterocyclic carbenes and their precursor<lb/> molecules and thus predict them for customized applications.<lb/> Thus, in order to quantify the ability of heterocyclic precursors<lb/> to form carbenes, the CREF values (carbene relative energy of<lb/> formation) of heterocycles, heteroaromatics and mesomeric<lb/> betaines, which can in principle form N-heterocyclic carbenes<lb/> by deprotonation, were determined. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> As consequence, various<lb/> methods are available to characterize the electronic properties<lb/> of N-heterocyclic carbenes themselves. These include the<lb/> Tolman parameter (TEP), <ref type="biblio">12</ref> Huynh parameter, <ref type="biblio">13</ref> proton<lb/> affinities, molecular electrostatic potentials (MESP), <ref type="biblio">14</ref> compu-<lb/>tationally derived electronic ligand parameters (CEP), <ref type="biblio">15</ref> 1 J C-H<lb/> and 1 J C-Se coupling constants, and selenium NMR shifts, <ref type="biblio">18<lb/></ref> which are used with respect to the π-acceptor and σ-donor<lb/> properties of the resulting NHCs. The basic idea of using 77 Se<lb/> NMR resonance frequencies in this context is that carbenes<lb/> with high σ-donicity lead to selenones in which the 77 Se atom<lb/> is more shielded and therefore an upfield shift of the signals<lb/> occurs, whereas in π-acceptor carbenes the resulting selenones<lb/> are more deshielded and therefore a downfield shift is observed<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). <ref type="biblio">16-19<lb/></ref> </p>
				
            <p>The literature occasionally mentions that, in addition to the<lb/> structure, the temperature, <ref type="biblio">17</ref> the pH value, the analyte<lb/> concentration and the solvents also influence the position of<lb/> the 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies. <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> As can be seen from<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the 77 Se NMR shifts do indeed change with the<lb/> change of solvent in the few examples studied so far. For<lb/> example, the 77 Se NMR signal of 1,3-di-tert-butyl-imidazole-2-<lb/>selenone I appears at δ = 197 ppm in acetone-d 6 and at δ = 183<lb/> ppm in deuterated chloroform. In the literature, selenium shifts<lb/> of selenoureas derived from N-heterocyclic carbenes are found<lb/> in a variety of solvents ranging from CDCl 3 , <ref type="biblio">20</ref> acetone-d 6 , <ref type="biblio">21</ref><lb/> CD 3 CN, <ref type="biblio">22</ref> THF-d 8 <ref type="biblio">23</ref> to DMSO-d 6 . <ref type="biblio">24</ref> The exchange of<lb/> substituents on the N atoms of the imidazole for substituents<lb/> with different steric requirements and electronic properties<lb/> results in considerable changes in the 77 Se NMR shifts. For<lb/> example, the shift differences when exchanging the tert-butyl<lb/> substituents of I to cyclohexyl (III), whose E s values (Cy =<lb/> -2.03; tBu = -2.78) <ref type="biblio">25</ref> and A values (Cy: 2.15; tBu: &gt; 4) <ref type="biblio">25</ref> as a<lb/> measure of steric hindrance differ, are around Δδ = 205 ppm<lb/> into the high field. If Hammett&apos;s σ parameter is used as a<lb/> measure of the electronic properties, the values of the two<lb/> substituents differ only slightly (Cy: σ m = -0.05; σ p = -0.15;<lb/> tBu: σ m : -0.1, σ p : -0.2), <ref type="biblio">26,27</ref> but it is undoubtedly too simple<lb/> to reduce substituent effects on the 77 Se NMR shifts to the<lb/> parameters captured by these numbers. The aromatic mesityl<lb/> residue on both N atoms causes a resonance frequency at δ =<lb/> 27 ppm in deuterated chloroform. The substituents on the<lb/> imidazole ring system, which are located at positions C4 and<lb/> C5, have a further influence. Examples IV and V from Figure <ref type="figure">2<lb/></ref> carry one and two donor substituents, respectively, with<lb/> Hammett values of σ m = +0.12/σ p = -0.37 (OH, respectively)<lb/> and σ m = -0.16/σ p = -0.83 (NMe 2 , respectively), which are<lb/> known to combine inductive, mesomeric and field effects in<lb/> one value, and show different shifts in CDCl 3 around Δδ = 137<lb/> ppm.<lb/></p>

			<p>Overall, the comparison with systems known from the<lb/> literature shows that further systematic examples and data<lb/> obtained from them are still lacking, <ref type="biblio">12b</ref> especially those<lb/> involving charges and conjugation types. Therefore, mesomeric<lb/> betaines are valuable model compounds to study potential<lb/> influences. The aim of our work was therefore to develop new<lb/> mesomeric betaines of imidazole whose anionic structural<lb/> increment is conjugated to the hetarenium ring and thus<lb/> directly influences the potential carbene center. For reasons of<lb/> stability, a heteroaromatic should serve as the anionic<lb/> structural element, which can additionally stabilize the negative<lb/> charge by delocalization. The title compounds, imidazolium-4-<lb/>pyrrolides, appeared to be well suited for this purpose. As<lb/> illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, according to the rules of resonance, the<lb/> negative charge delocalizes not only within the anionic pyrrole<lb/> ring, but can also be formulated on C2 and C5 of the imidazole<lb/> ring. This fact, in combination with the characteristic dipole<lb/> increment and the isoconjugate equivalent, defines the<lb/> molecule as a conjugated mesomeric betaine, <ref type="biblio">28</ref> strictly<lb/> speaking as a mesoionic compound denoting the 5-membered<lb/> rings within this class. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> Five different classes of mesomeric<lb/> betaines are now distinguished. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> Of these, the conjugated<lb/> mesomeric betaines are likely to have a particularly significant<lb/> influence on the carbene center via both inductive and<lb/> mesomeric effects. <ref type="biblio">31<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>Continuing our interest in the chemistry of mesomeric<lb/> betaines <ref type="biblio">32</ref> and related structures, in particular their ability to<lb/> form N-heterocyclic carbenes and their anionic analogs, <ref type="biblio">33</ref> we<lb/> report here on the syntheses of the above-mentioned new<lb/> target betaines, on their tendency to carbene formation, and on<lb/> the 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies of the selenium adducts<lb/> of these carbenes.<lb/></p>

			<head>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>The retrosynthetic analysis indicated that the target betaines<lb/> could best be synthesized from the corresponding imidazolium<lb/> salts, where the imidazolium salts should be prepared by<lb/> quaternization of the corresponding 1,5-disubstituted and<lb/></p>

			<p>1,4,5-trisubstituted imidazoles, which can be synthesized via a<lb/> bismuth(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate-catalyzed van Leusen<lb/> reaction as shown in Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>. <ref type="biblio">34,37</ref> Thus, starting from<lb/> pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde 1, N-alkyl or N-aryl imines 2a-c were<lb/> prepared by reacting the aldehyde with primary amines. In the<lb/> case of the N-alkylimines 2a,b, these were easily prepared by<lb/> adding the corresponding amine to a solution of the aldehyde<lb/> in hexane at room temperature (procedure A). Synthesis of the<lb/> N-aryl imine 2c required the reaction to be carried out in<lb/> methanol under reflux conditions and the addition of catalytic<lb/> amounts of formic acid (procedure B). The formamides 4a-c<lb/> resulted from the reaction of formamide with p-toluenesulfonic<lb/> acid and the corresponding benzaldehydes in the presence of<lb/> TMSCl <ref type="biblio">34</ref> (method C) and served as starting materials for the<lb/> synthesis of the TosMIC derivatives 5a-c. These were<lb/> prepared easily and with moderate to good yields by<lb/> dehydration using POCl 3 and trimethylamine (procedure<lb/> D). <ref type="biblio">35</ref> The pyrrole imines 2a-c were then reacted either with<lb/> TosMIC to give 1,5-disubstituted imidazoles or with the<lb/> modified TosMIC derivatives 5a-c to give 1,4,5-trisubstituted<lb/> imidazoles 6a-e. All ring closure reactions were carried out in<lb/> methanol at room temperature using tert-butyl amine as a base,<lb/> with a reaction time of 12 h (procedure E, van Leusen<lb/> reaction). Substitution patterns and yields are summarized in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the syntheses of the N-alkyl imidazoles 5a-e were<lb/> successful, the N-aryl imidazole 5f for the synthesis of 6f could<lb/> not be obtained by this reaction route. In fact, the reaction of<lb/> imine 2c according to the method shown above yielded the<lb/> same imidazole as in the case of imine 2b by an undesired<lb/> transamination reaction (Scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Such reactions of imines<lb/> in the presence of other amines are known from the<lb/> literature. <ref type="biblio">36</ref> In order to suppress this, attempts were made,<lb/> albeit unsuccessfully, to carry out the ring closure reaction of<lb/> derivative 2c with potassium carbonate. <ref type="biblio">36<lb/></ref></p>

            <p>To synthesize the imidazolium salts, the resulting com-<lb/>pounds 6a-e were either N-methylated or N-benzylated<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Methylation was carried out in case of 7a with<lb/> Meerwein&apos;s reagent in anhydrous DCM at room temperature<lb/> for 12 h, during which time the salt precipitated (procedure F).<lb/> For the imidazolium salts 7b-d, a reaction with Meerwein&apos;s<lb/> reagent is excluded, as they cannot be dissolved in solvents<lb/> suitable for the reaction. The synthesis was therefore carried<lb/> out in good to almost quantitative yields by reacting the<lb/> imidazoles with excess methyl iodide in dry acetonitrile under<lb/> reflux conditions. The quaternization by benzylation was<lb/> carried out by reaction with the corresponding benzyl<lb/> bromides in anhydrous THF under reflux, and similarly to<lb/> the methylation, the corresponding salts 7e-i were obtained in<lb/> good yields. The imidazolium salts 7a-k were then converted<lb/> to the corresponding mesomeric betaines using the anion<lb/> exchange resin Amberlite IRA 400 in its hydroxide forms. <ref type="biblio">38<lb/></ref> This was successful for all derivatives in good to very good<lb/> yields (c.f. Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>NMR-spectroscopic investigations, which were only possible<lb/> in DMSO-d 6 or CD 3 OD due to the high polarity of the<lb/> betaines investigated, provided no evidence for a betaine-<lb/>carbene tautomerism 7A ↔ 7B (Scheme <ref type="figure">4</ref>). A similar NMR<lb/> spectroscopic behavior was observed for other imidazole-based<lb/> mesomeric betaines such as quinazolin-4-one imidazolium<lb/> betaines <ref type="biblio">39</ref> and purine imidazolium betaines. <ref type="biblio">40<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>The calculated frontier orbital profiles (B3LYP/6-311+<lb/> +G**) show a characteristic architecture of conjugated<lb/> mesomeric betaines. Typically, the frontier orbitals are<lb/> essentially located in the same parts of the molecule and this<lb/> is undoubtedly valid at least for the calculated HOMOs of the<lb/> betaines (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). As expected, the anionic pyrrolide ring has<lb/> the larger atomic orbital coefficients in comparison to the<lb/> imidazole ring. It is noteworthy that, according to the<lb/> calculation, the phenyl ring in 7b has hardly any atomic<lb/> orbital coefficients in the HOMO, but strong ones in the<lb/> LUMO despite the torsion angle of τ = 55.7°. On the other<lb/> hand, this matches the LUMO profile of the N-benzylated<lb/> derivative 7h, whose LUMO is mainly localized in the benzene<lb/> ring of the benzyl substituent. The HOMOs have large atomic<lb/> orbital coefficients at the C2 positions of the imidazolium ring<lb/> of the betaines, which form the carbene carbon atoms during<lb/> subsequent deprotonation.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to estimate the ability of the mesoionic compounds<lb/> to form anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes, the CREF (carbene<lb/> relative energy of formation) of the compounds were then<lb/> determined. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> All CREF values of the imidazolium betaines<lb/> were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level to ensure<lb/> comparison with values from the literature. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> Surprisingly, the<lb/> CREF values of the derivatives considered in this work (Table<lb/> <ref type="table">3</ref>) differ only slightly, since the values obtained are apparently<lb/> neither significantly influenced by the substituents at the 4-<lb/>position of the imidazole 7b-7d nor by the different<lb/> substituents at the two nitrogen positions of the imidazole.<lb/> Apparently, they are determined exclusively by the π-character<lb/> of the betainic system. Compared to other anionic imidazole-<lb/>based NHCs which are derived from mesomeric betaines, such<lb/> as 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-4-aminide (CREF = 0.557) 11a or<lb/> 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-4-olate (CREF = 0.576), <ref type="biblio">11a</ref> the<lb/> derivatives of this work show lower CREF values, which<lb/> makes them promising carbene precursors among the anionic<lb/> imidazolium-based NHCs.<lb/></p>

			<p>The mesomeric betaine 7a was selected as a reference<lb/> compound for base screening to find the optimal conditions<lb/> for the formation of selenourea derivatives of the NHCs<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). The best results were obtained by reactions in<lb/> anhydrous MeCN with 2 eq. of cesium carbonate as base<lb/> under reflux at a reaction time of 12 h. All other betaines 8b-<lb/>8i were also converted to selenones 9b-i under these<lb/> conditions. Although the formation of the abnormal carbene<lb/> at the C-5 position of the imidazole is conceivable for R″ =<lb/> H, <ref type="biblio">41</ref> no products other than those described were obtained<lb/> under the selected conditions.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the pdf of the text, it appears as if the syntheses of 8b-8i<lb/> have no conditions (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). Is it possible to visualize this<lb/> graphically so that it is clear that the same conditions apply to<lb/> 8a to 8i? Perhaps by drawing a line above 8a and placing the<lb/> conditions in the middle between 8a and 8i? As far as the<lb/> HOMO profiles of the carbenes are concerned, they behave<lb/> similarly to the betaines from which they are formed. First, it<lb/> should be noted that the HOMO of the anionic N-heterocyclic<lb/> carbenes is a π-orbital. Finally, HOMO-2 shows the orbital<lb/> characteristic of carbenes, which lies in the plane of the<lb/> heterocycle. The π-orbital of the HOMO is localized in both<lb/></p>

            <p>In comparison to classical neutral imidazole-based carbenes,<lb/> such as A <ref type="biblio">33c</ref> and B, <ref type="biblio">16</ref> it is evident that the carbenes of the<lb/> imidazolium-4-pyrrolides described here (F, G) exhibit<lb/> significantly higher HOMO energies. In this regard, these<lb/> compounds inherit a similar behavior to other π-electron-rich<lb/> anionic NHCs, including the sydnones (E), <ref type="biblio">33c</ref> sydnone<lb/> methides (C), <ref type="biblio">33c</ref> imidazole N-ylides (D) <ref type="biblio">24a</ref> and sydnonimines<lb/> (H). <ref type="biblio">32b</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). A feature of imidazolium-4-pyrrolides in<lb/> comparison to the aforementioned NHC systems is that, as<lb/> previously mentioned, the HOMO-2 exhibits the conven-<lb/>tional carbene geometry. It should be noted that the<lb/> calculations did not show any coefficients of the LUMO,<lb/> LUMO+1, and LUMO+2 of compounds F and G that would<lb/> allow identification as π-acceptor (Eπ).<lb/></p>

			<p>N-Heterocyclic carbenes are known to be good electron<lb/> donors, which is the reason for their broad application in<lb/> chemistry mentioned at the beginning. <ref type="biblio">2-6</ref> The bonding<lb/> between NHCs and transition metals occurs through σ-and<lb/> π-interactions, which are attempted to be quantified using the<lb/> methods listed in the introduction. <ref type="biblio">11-18</ref> However, the<lb/> evaluation of the 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies appears<lb/> to be complicated. <ref type="biblio">12b</ref> Considering the importance of the 77 Se<lb/> resonance frequencies of selenoureas for the characterization of<lb/> N-heterocyclic carbenes, we first systematically investigated the<lb/> influence of the solvent in order to compare them with the<lb/> results for various other selenium compounds. <ref type="biblio">42-44</ref> For this<lb/> purpose, the 77 Se NMR shifts of the selenones 9a, 9b, 9e and<lb/> 9h were measured in a selection of common NMR solvents of<lb/> different properties. All samples were measured at the same<lb/> temperature. We chose a uniform concentration of 0.17 M<lb/> selenium compound, because results known from the<lb/> literature <ref type="biblio">42</ref> show that below a concentration of 2.0 M there<lb/> is no concentration dependence of the 77 Se NMR resonance<lb/> frequencies, at least for compounds such as diselenides. <ref type="biblio">43</ref> We<lb/> also used the measurements of 9a to investigate whether<lb/> different referencing methods have an influence on the 77 Se<lb/> NMR shift. Three recommendations have been made by<lb/> IUPAC regarding the calibration of NMR shifts, and these are<lb/> internal and external referencing and the substitution<lb/> method. <ref type="biblio">45</ref> Especially in 77 Se NMR spectroscopy, external<lb/> referencing and the substitution method are widely used. <ref type="biblio">17,42,46<lb/></ref></p>
				
			<p>The spectra of the compounds mentioned above were<lb/> referenced externally against PhSe-SePh <ref type="biblio">49</ref> and internally by<lb/> adding SeMe 2 . Since our investigations have shown that the<lb/> 77 Se NMR shift of the reference substance PhSe-SePh depends<lb/> on the solvent used, we have decided to always carry out the<lb/> referencing in the same solvent in which the analyte under<lb/> consideration is measured. The signal of the external reference<lb/> is fixed at 461.0 ppm relative to Me-Se-Me @ 0.0 ppm. For<lb/> more detailed information on the behavior of the 77 Se NMR<lb/> shifts of PhSe-SePh in the various solvents, please refer to the<lb/> Supporting Information (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>, p. S4). The latter method<lb/> with the toxic SeMe 2 is very unpleasant due to the strong odor.<lb/> Findings on how this reagent can be avoided are therefore<lb/> certainly of particular importance. The values summarized in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">5</ref> are shown graphically in Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>First of all, it is noticeable that the reference reagent can<lb/> have an undeniable influence on the determination of the<lb/> chemical shift in 77 Se NMR spectroscopy, but this depends<lb/> strongly on the solvent. The 77 Se NMR signals determined in<lb/> CDCl 3 proved to be particularly sensitive to the referencing<lb/> reagents, which led to widely differing values. In contrast, the<lb/> signals of 9a are unaffected if the measurements are carried out<lb/> in acetone-d 6 , for example. It is known that the 77 Se NMR<lb/> resonance frequency of SeMe 2 depends on the concentration<lb/> (Δδ = 9 ppm from neat to very dilute), on the solvent<lb/> [δ(C 6 H 12 ) -δ(DMSO) &gt; 20 ppm] and on the temperature<lb/> (Δδ = 2.5 ppm above 100 °C), so that a 60% solution of<lb/> dimethylselenide in CDCl 3 was proposed as a suitable<lb/> reference reagent. <ref type="biblio">47<lb/></ref> </p>
				
			<p>In line with previous results the choice of solvent has a<lb/> considerable influence on the NMR shifts obtained. The 77 Se<lb/></p>

			<p>NMR shifts change roughly in parallel and follow a similar<lb/> trend on changing the solvent (Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>). This also applies to<lb/> 1,3-dimethylimidazole-2-selenone, which we also examined for<lb/> comparison. The measured 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies<lb/> do not correlate with the known empirical parameters for the<lb/> determination of solvent polarity such as the Z-values <ref type="biblio">50,51</ref> or<lb/> E T<lb/> N values, <ref type="biblio">50,52</ref> which are listed in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> for information and<lb/> refer to the nondeuterated solvents.

			<p>solvents, also differ, as can be seen from the normalized D N<lb/> N<lb/> values (MeCN: 14.1 kcal/mol, DMSO: 29.8 kcal/mol). <ref type="biblio">54</ref> A<lb/> simple correlation between all these classification numbers and<lb/> the observed chemical shifts of 77 Se is not recognizable, which<lb/> is obviously the sum of various influences of different<lb/> weightings. The influence of the substitution pattern on the<lb/> 77<lb/> Se NMR resonance frequencies also does not follow a simple<lb/> pattern in literature examples <ref type="biblio">43</ref> and the substituent effects are<lb/> not additive in this respect. <ref type="biblio">48</ref> Based on the results described<lb/> above, we decided to carry out the 77 Se NMR measurements of<lb/> the selenones from this work consistently in DMSO-d 6 , in<lb/> which all compounds are soluble. Table <ref type="table">6</ref> shows the 77 Se NMR<lb/> shifts obtained. With the exception of the derivatives 9h and 9i,<lb/> all 77 Se NMR shifts are in a range between 50.3 and 68.2 ppm,<lb/> with those selenones substituted in the 4-position showing<lb/> slightly higher shifts. The N-benzylated products, on the other<lb/> hand, behave similarly to the methylated selenone 9a. The<lb/> rather high shifts of the derivatives 9h and 9i are surprising;<lb/> this phenomenon has already been observed in other<lb/> publications in connection with tert-butyl or adamantyl<lb/> substituents on the imidazole nitrogen. <ref type="biblio">21b,55</ref> The reasons for<lb/> this phenomenon do not yet seem to be clearly understood.<lb/> Anisotropy effects, paramagnetic effects and C(sp 3 )-H-Se-<lb/>interactions arising from a negative hyperconjugation between<lb/> the lone pair of selenium and the σ* C-H orbital are being<lb/> discussed in this context. The fact is that DFT calculations<lb/> (B3LYP/6-311++G**) of the energetically most favorable<lb/> structures of 9a,e,h result in planar imidazole rings in all three<lb/> structures, in which the selenium also lies in the same plane,<lb/> despite different steric requirements (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>). The C-Se<lb/> distance is about 1.84 Å in all structures and this distance<lb/> corresponds to that of other selenones. The angle between the<lb/> C-2 position and the nitrogen substituents is also similar in all<lb/> molecules and lies between 123°and 127°. The pyrrole<lb/> substituent is twisted toward the ring plane of the imidazole in<lb/> all derivatives, as is the benzyl substituent in 9e. The sum of<lb/> the van der Waals radii of hydrogen (1.2 Å) <ref type="biblio">56</ref> and selenium<lb/> (1.9 Å) <ref type="biblio">57</ref> (Σ = 3.1) is larger than the smallest distance between<lb/> these atoms in 9a (2.98-3.42 Å). In the derivative 9e, the<lb/> nearest proton of the methylene group of the benzyl<lb/> substituent is at a distance of 2.70 Å, while the distance to<lb/> the methyl protons is between 2.82 and 3.63 Å. In the case of<lb/> the N-tert-butyl derivative 9h, two protons of the methyl<lb/> groups have a distance of 2.68 Å and the distance to the<lb/> methylene protons of the benzyl group is 2.62 Å, which are the<lb/> smallest within this series of investigated derivatives.<lb/></p>

			<p>Next, we investigated the often-cited temperature depend-<lb/>ence of the 77 Se NMR resonance frequency. <ref type="biblio">17,43,47,56,58,59</ref> For<lb/> this purpose, two NMR spectra of 9h in CD 3 CN were<lb/> recorded in the range from 15 to 50 °C (Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref>). Ph 2 Se 2 was<lb/> used as both internal and external reference; Me 2 Se was not<lb/> used as internal reference due to the low vapor pressure of the<lb/> substance. The samples externally referenced to Ph 2 Se 2 at<lb/> 461.0 ppm in CD 3 CN at 25 °C relative to Me 2 Se at 0.0 ppm<lb/> show a linear increase in the 77 Se NMR shift with increasing<lb/> temperature, with a rate of change of +0.13 ppm/K with an R 2<lb/> = 0.999.<lb/></p>

			<p>When using Ph 2 Se 2 as an internal standard, where the signal<lb/> of the standard was set to 461 ppm independent of<lb/> temperature, the 77 Se shift of 9h also shows a linear<lb/> dependence, but it is negative at -0.09 ppm/K (R 2 =<lb/> 0.993), which can be explained by the temperature depend-<lb/>ence of the standard. Ph 2 Se 2 shows a linear positive 77 Se NMR<lb/> shift of +0.28 ppm/K (Supporting Information, Figure <ref type="figure">S201</ref>, p.<lb/> S206) when it is externally referenced to Ph 2 Se 2 . In our<lb/> analysis of the NMR spectra, we found that the 77 Se NMR shift<lb/> of Ph 2 Se 2 as well as that of 9h in the mixture is shifted<lb/> downfield by 4 ppm compared to the signal of the pure<lb/> standards at the same temperature. This indicates an<lb/> interaction of the internal standard with the analyte. To<lb/> confirm this assumption, we performed another NMR<lb/> experiment in a coaxial NMR tube using a mixture of Ph 2 Se 2<lb/> and 9h in a 1:1 ratio in the outer chamber and only the<lb/> standard in the inner tube. Two 77 Se NMR resonance<lb/> frequencies were detected for the Ph 2 Se 2 , which were offset<lb/></p>

Based on these results, it<lb/> can be assumed that an interaction with the analyte occurs<lb/> when at least Ph 2 Se 2 is used as the internal standard. Internally<lb/> and externally referenced samples can therefore not be readily<lb/> compared. Since we have already observed a considerable<lb/> dependence of the 77 Se resonance frequency on the solvent<lb/> used, we were also interested in whether standard analyt<lb/> interactions are also dependent on the solvent. We therefore<lb/> measured a sample of selenoureas 9h and 9e in chloroform and<lb/> referenced it once internally and once externally against<lb/> Ph 2 Se 2 , as this is probably the most frequently used solvent for<lb/> 77 Se NMR measurements. The 77 Se resonance frequencies of<lb/> these measurements show no deviation, from which it can be<lb/> concluded that the previously observed interactions are also<lb/> solvent dependent.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, to study the influence of a negatively charged<lb/> pyrrolide substituent on the NMR resonance frequencies,<lb/> selenone 9a was deprotonated in situ in an NMR tube to yield<lb/> the anion 10a. Thus, 0.25 to 2 equiv of potassium tert-butoxide<lb/> were added in portions to a sample of 9a in DMSO-d 6 and the<lb/> 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and 77 Se NMR shifts of the sample were<lb/> measured. During deprotonation, it was observed that the 1 H<lb/> NMR signals of the pyrrole and imidazole ring undergo<lb/> highfield shifts as expected (Figure <ref type="figure">10</ref>) and a similar, albeit less<lb/> pronounced, effect can also be seen in the 13 C NMR spectrum.<lb/> Position 4 of the imidazole displayed the strongest change by<lb/> 0.45 ppm in the 1 H NMR spectrum which is in accord with the<lb/> delocalization of the negative charge within the conjugated<lb/> anion 10a. In analogy to the base screening experiments, no<lb/></p>

			<p>evidence of deprotonation of the C5 position was obtained<lb/> when base was added to compound 9a, indicating that no<lb/> abnormal carbene is formed under the chosen conditions.<lb/> Therefore, the signal of the methyl group at N1 also shifts to a<lb/> higher field. As the methyl group at N3 forms a hydrogen bond<lb/> to the nitrogen atom of the pyrrole ring, its signal shifts to<lb/> lower field, as it is now fixed in the plane of the pyrrole ring<lb/> and anisotropy effects occur. The 77 Se NMR signal shifts by<lb/> 20.3 ppm from 52.1 pmm to 31.8 ppm during this<lb/> deprotonation. Results of the NMR titration are shown in<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">S181</ref> (Supporting Information). For the same reason,<lb/> protons of the phenyl ring of 10b undergo a strong high-field<lb/> shift. Similar 77 Se NMR shifts are observed with 9e and 9b,<lb/> whose values are shifted by 19 and 17 ppm into the high field.<lb/> To the best of our knowledge, these are the first values that<lb/> quantify the influence of negative charges of substituents<lb/> conjugated to imidazole by 77 Se NMR spectroscopy. A<lb/> graphical and comparative compilation of the NMR shift<lb/> differences during deprotonation can be found in the<lb/> Supporting Material (Figures <ref type="figure">S180, S181, S188, S189, S196,<lb/> and S197</ref>). After the addition of 2 eq. KOt-Bu, we were able to<lb/> detect an additional signal in the 1 H NMR spectrum with a<lb/> resonance frequency of 3.6 ppm. It can be assumed that this is<lb/> probably water that has entered the sample during the addition<lb/> of the base, which was not dried beforehand, or from the<lb/> environment. The measured spectra of compound 9a show<lb/> that this signal is not related to the analyte.<lb/></p>

            <p>Comparing the 77 Se NMR shifts of the selenium adducts<lb/> described here with those of other N-heterocyclic imidazole<lb/> compounds such as 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazole-2-<lb/>s e l e n o n e ( δ 7 7 S e = -1 8 p p m ) , <ref type="biblio">2 1 b 4</ref> , 5 -b i s ( 1 , 3 -<lb/>diisopropylphenyl)imidazole-2-selenone (δ 77 Se = 87 ppm), <ref type="biblio">21b<lb/></ref> 1,3-diadamantylimidazole-2-selenone (δ 77 Se = 197 ppm) <ref type="biblio">21b</ref><lb/> and 1,3-bis(1,3,5-trimethylphenyl)-2-selenoxoimidazolidine-<lb/>4,5-dione (δ 77 Se = 856 ppm), <ref type="biblio">18</ref> one can speak of moderate<lb/> π-acceptor properties of our molecules on the basis of the<lb/> previous opinion on the significance of the 77 Se shifts, which is<lb/> not surprising considering their π-electron density. This is<lb/> consistent with the shift differences when the selenoureas are<lb/> converted from the neutral to the anionic form. Based on our<lb/> observations of the electronic structure of betaine and<lb/> deprotonated selenourea, an application of the systems<lb/> shown here in transition metal catalysis is conceivable. The<lb/> betaines represent π-electron-rich systems which, depending<lb/> on the choice of conditions, could also be used as anionic<lb/> ligands. <ref type="biblio">60a,b</ref> In addition, due to the synthesis used, the betaines<lb/> could be easily modified and thus adapted to the requirements<lb/> of catalysis. A further modification of the N-position of the<lb/> pyrrole also seems possible. <ref type="biblio">60<lb/></ref></p>

 			<head>■ CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>In summary, using new mesoionic compounds with an<lb/> imidazolium and a pyrrolide building block, a systematic<lb/> investigation of factors for 77 Se NMR shifts used in the<lb/> literature to estimate the electronic properties of N-<lb/>heterocyclic carbenes such as σ-donor and π-acceptor<lb/> properties is presented here. These mesoionic compounds<lb/> can be effectively prepared via a four-step synthesis and show<lb/> promising CREF values of about 0.546 for estimating the<lb/> formation tendency of anionic N-heterocyclic carbenes by<lb/> deprotonation. These values obviously do not include N1-,<lb/> N3-and C4-substituent influences because the values of the<lb/> different substitution patterns of the model compounds are<lb/> very similar. Rather, the π-character of the mesoionic basic<lb/> system is dominant. The HOMOs of the anionic N-<lb/>heterocyclic carbenes are π-orbitals originating in mesoionic<lb/> compounds. As expected, systematic studies of the 77 Se NMR<lb/> resonance frequencies of the selenourea derivatives of the<lb/> corresponding NHCs show dependencies on the substitution<lb/> pattern, with the tert.-butyl derivative causing sudden down-<lb/>field shifts to ca. 183 ppm, consistent with literature<lb/> observations. We were able to systematically investigate the<lb/> solvent dependence often cited in the literature on our model<lb/> systems and found a parallelism of the solvent-induced shift<lb/> differences and the respective substitution patterns, whereby<lb/> the order of the solvents to visualize this parallelism does not<lb/> follow any simple property relationships such as the solvent<lb/> polarity, the donicity or the basicity of the solvents. However,<lb/> the temperature dependence can be quantified very well. We<lb/> were also able to show that the referencing method (Me 2 Se vs.<lb/> PhSe-SePh) can, but does not necessarily have to, have a<lb/> profound influence on the 77 Se NMR shifts determined,<lb/> depending on the NMR solvent. For example, measurements<lb/> in CDCl 3 react particularly sensitively to the type of<lb/> referencing, whereas no influence could be detected for<lb/> measurements in acetone-d 6 for the molecules described<lb/> here. The effects of the charges on the 77 Se NMR shifts are<lb/> described here for the first time. Negative charges delocalized<lb/> in the π-system of heteroaromatics lead to highfield shifts of<lb/> the 77 Se NMR resonance frequencies between -20.2 ppm and<lb/> -17.6 ppm, depending on the substitution pattern of the<lb/> underlying ring system. These results will be useful for anyone<lb/> using 77 Se NMR values of selenium adducts to estimate the<lb/> electronic properties of N-heterocyclic carbenes<lb/> </p>

            <p>General Remarks. All commercially available chemicals were used<lb/> without further purification unless otherwise mentioned. Anhydrous<lb/> solvents were dried according to standard procedures (acetonitrile) or<lb/> purchased from a MP5 Solvent Purification System of the company<lb/> Inert Technology (diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran). The reactions were<lb/> traced by thin layer chromatography (TLC) performed on 60 F254<lb/> sillica-coated aluminum plates from Merck and visualized using UV<lb/> light (254 nm). The preparative column chromatography was<lb/> conducted through silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) of the company<lb/> Merck. For the ion-exchange column chromatography the exchange<lb/> resin Amberlite IRA-400(Cl) from Alfa Aesar was used. The 1 H and<lb/> 13 C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz<lb/> spectrometer (at 600.35 MHz for 1 H NMR, 150.96 MHz for 13 C<lb/> NMR), and a Bruker Avance Neo 400 MHz spectrometer (at 400.23<lb/> MHz for 1 H NMR, 100.64 MHz for 13 C NMR). 77 Se spectra were<lb/> measured with a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer (at 114.50<lb/> MHz for 77 Se) and referenced externally to dimethyl selenide or<lb/> internally by addition of Me 2 Se, as indicated. NMR solvent peaks<lb/> were used as the internal reference, all solvents were obtained from<lb/> Deutero GmbH. Multiplicities are described by using the following<lb/> abbreviations: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, and m =<lb/> multiplet. Signal orientations in DEPT experiments were described as<lb/> follows: o = no signal; + = up (CH, CH 3 ); -= down (CH 2 ). 1 H NMR<lb/> coupling constants are mentioned in Hz. The ATR-IR spectra were<lb/> measured with a Bruker Alpha in the range of 400 to 4000 cm -1 . The<lb/> electrospray ionization mass spectra were measured with a Bruker<lb/> Impact II mass spectrometer, spraying the samples from methanol.<lb/> Melting points were determined in an apparatus according to Dr.<lb/> Tottoli (Buchi) and are uncorrected.
