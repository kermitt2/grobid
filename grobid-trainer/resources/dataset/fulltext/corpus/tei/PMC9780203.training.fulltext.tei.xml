			<p>Breast cancer is the most frequent kind of cancer and the second-leading cause of mortality among women<lb/> worldwide. Currently, the backbone of therapy for breast cancer is mainly chemotherapy, however, the majority<lb/> of its chemotherapeutic medications are associated with toxicity in normal cells and drug resistance. Therefore,<lb/> there is an urgent need for the development of effective, and pharmacologically safe antineoplastic agents to<lb/> treat breast cancer <ref type="biblio">1</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>The pyrimidinone ring is central in novel drugs because is it known to exhibit diverse biological activities such<lb/> as antiviral, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities <ref type="biblio">2-5</ref> . Chalcones is also known for its wide range<lb/> of biological properties, including anticancer activities. These substances are also very interesting because they<lb/> can be used to create a variety of biologically active heterocycles, including azepines, pyrazolines, and flavones <ref type="biblio">6</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Pyrazoles are an extremely important scaffold for numerous anticancer agents. The presence of the pyrazole<lb/> moiety in several biologically active drugs has enabled the preparation of novel pyrazoline derivatives that can<lb/> be used as anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antimalarial, and antiviral <ref type="biblio">7,8</ref> . Here, we will focus on their<lb/> anticancer activity.<lb/></p>

			<p>The α, β-unsaturated ketones facile the synthesis of pyrimidinone derivatives through the reaction with urea<lb/> or thiourea <ref type="biblio">9-12</ref> and pyrazoline derivatives through the reaction with hydrazine and its derivatives <ref type="biblio">13,14</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>The progression of cancer is often accompanied by the abnormality of several signaling pathways. Abnor-<lb/>malities in pro-survival, apoptotic, and cell regulatory pathways have become increasingly important in the<lb/> pathogenesis of breast carcinogenesis <ref type="biblio">15</ref> . Targeting these pathways with pharmacologically safe agents has been<lb/> considered an appealing cancer prevention and treatment approach.<lb/></p>

			<p>The RAS family members like H-RAS, K-RAS, and N-RAS are tiny guanosine triphosphatases<lb/> (GTPases) which are the first human oncogenes that control a range of biological responses <ref type="biblio">16</ref> . RAS proteins<lb/> transmit extracellular signals to the cytoplasmic signaling network via tyrosine kinase receptors then to the<lb/> nucleus which in turn promotes the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, and death. The<lb/> hyperactive RAS signaling contributes significantly to breast cancer&apos;s growth, progression, and metastasis which<lb/> is also linked to breast cancer patients&apos; lower survival rates <ref type="biblio">17</ref> . Thus, the effective control of oncogenic RAS is a<lb/> therapeutic strategy in breast cancer <ref type="biblio">18</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, RAS effector families have been associated with the initiation and maintenance of cancer. There-<lb/>fore, it is anticipated that the inhibition of downstream proteins within these pathways could be a successful<lb/> strategy for preventing RAS-mediated oncogenesis. One of the main targets of the RAS effector signaling is the<lb/> RAS/PI3K/Akt pathway <ref type="biblio">19</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases that are responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of Akt <ref type="biblio">20</ref> . Akt<lb/> (protein kinase B (PKB)) is a serine-threonine protein kinase with oncogenic and antiapoptotic properties <ref type="biblio">21</ref> . In<lb/> breast cancer, the elevated expression of Akt causes normal breast cells to become neoplasm cells via the dysregu-<lb/>lation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p21 <ref type="biblio">22</ref> , and inactivation or mutant to tumor suppressor,<lb/> p53 protein so that the replication of abnormal DNA is not stopped <ref type="biblio">23</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Moreover, RAS activates the protein kinase, JNK which is known to regulate numerous physiological pro-<lb/>cesses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death. The JNK kinase family includes three<lb/> proteins, namely, JNK1, JNK2 which are expressed in most tissues, and JNK3, which is expressed in the tissues of<lb/> the brain, heart, and testes. JNK phosphorylates the transcription factor, c-Jun at Ser-63 and Ser-73 and these sites<lb/> have been demonstrated to be crucial for the induction of c-Jun activity and cooperation with RAS in oncogenic<lb/> transformation. Considering that the JNK pathway has been associated with cancer progression, RAS regulation<lb/> of JNK activity may have important implications for cancer biology <ref type="biblio">24</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>In the present study, we synthesized pyrimidine-2-thione derivatives to clarify the underlying mechanisms<lb/> in-silico and in-vitro by modulating the RAS/PI3K/Akt/JNK signaling pathways. This illuminates the idea of<lb/> creating RAS protein inhibitors and offers a possible path as a future treatment against breast cancer.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cell morphology. In a six-well plate, 1 × 10 5 MCF-7 cells were seeded and incubated for 24 h then treated with<lb/> the IC 50 dose of the selected compound. Using an inverted light microscope (Olympus, USA), the morphological<lb/> alterations of the treated and untreated cells were evaluated and documented after 48 h of incubation <ref type="biblio">34</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Using flow cytometry, cell cycle analysis was carried out via a documented<lb/> method of <ref type="biblio">35</ref> with a few changes. After trypsinization, the MCF-7 cells were centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 min,<lb/> followed by two washings, resuspension in 1× PBS, fixation with ice-cold absolute ethanol, and incubation at<lb/> 20 °C for 24 h. Following two PBS washes, the cells were then resuspended in (0.05 mg/mL) propidium iodide<lb/> (PI) <ref type="biblio">32</ref> solution containing 50 µL (0.2 mg/mL) of RNase A, and 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS.

			<p>A drug candidate must first pass a toxicity risk assessment to be considered for drug development. Low toxic-<lb/>ity and side effects are indicative of a medicine&apos;s high therapeutic index. Due to this, an in-silico toxicity analysis<lb/> was carried out, with the outcomes displayed in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. Surprisingly, none of the substances proved carcinogenic.<lb/></p>

			<p>Additionally, an AMES toxicity analysis was conducted, and all compounds (3a-6b) tested negative, indicat-<lb/>ing that they have no mutagenic effects. Computed LD 50 levels in the oral rat acute toxicity models have been<lb/> calculated for further investigation of the in-vivo anticancer activities, and the compounds appear to be quite<lb/> safe (2.42-2.76 mol/kg) <ref type="biblio">41</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>According to the previous results, the best-docked molecule 5a that impact a great inhibition to H-RAS, GTP<lb/> active form target protein also, showed perfect in-silico physio-chemical, pharmacokinetic and bioavailability<lb/> without any toxicity and carcinogenicity could be a potential new anticancer drug candidate.<lb/></p>

			<p>In vitro studies. Growth inhibition of different human cancer cell lines by compound 5a. In the present<lb/> study, the cytotoxic effect of the synthesized compound 5a, and the chemotherapeutic drug, DOX was revealed<lb/> by MTT assay on different human cancer cell lines including breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), colorectal<lb/> (Caco-2), and pancreatic (PANC-1) cancer cells as well as normal cells (WISH). Compound 5a caused dose-de-<lb/>pendent suppression of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, Caco-2, and PANC-1 cancer cell proliferation with IC 50 values of<lb/> 2.617 ± 1.6, 6.778 ± 2.2, 14.8 ± 2.5 and 23.58 ± 2.4 µM respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). According to our finding, compound<lb/> 5a exhibited the lowest IC 50 value against MCF-7 cells indicating that they were more sensitive to this compound<lb/> than other malignant cell lines compared with the cytotoxic effect of DOX that exhibited an IC 50 value equal<lb/> to 2.261 ± 1.4 µM (Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>). On the other hand, compound 5a exhibited less cytotoxicity to the normal cell line<lb/> with an IC 50 of 180.5 ± 2.7 µM in comparison with cancer cell lines, which proved its safety on normal cells.<lb/> Contrarily, DOX showed a significant toxic effect against normal cells with an IC 50 of 24.49 ± 2.1 µM. Therefore,<lb/> we extended our study using the MCF-7 cells.<lb/></p>

			<p>Alternation of the morphological features of MCF-7 cells by compound 5a. In this study, MCF-7 cells treated<lb/> with an IC 50 of 5a showed detectable morphological signs of apoptosis such as cell rounding and shrinkage with<lb/> decreased cell number detachment, and cytoplasmic condensation. However, the untreated cell morphology<lb/> appeared normal and confluent. These findings provided more information regarding the capacity of compound<lb/> 5a to trigger cell death (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Induction of cell cycle arrest of the MCF-7 cells by compound 5a. Cell cycle analysis was conducted on breast<lb/> cancer cells to better understand the mechanism of the 5a-mediated tumor growth inhibition, and the findings<lb/> are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. In the MCF-7 untreated cells, oncogenic RAS-induced proliferative signals resulted in the<lb/> upregulation of transcriptional factors required for cell cycle entrance and cellular progression. Additionally, the<lb/> metabolic stability of cyclin D1 was affected by the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β, which<lb/> is correlated with continuous ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 via PI3K-dependent<lb/> phosphorylation <ref type="biblio">17</ref> . Moreover, oncogenic RAS accelerates cell cycle progression by reducing the inhibition<lb/> caused by antigrowth signaling pathways which inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors like p21 <ref type="biblio">42</ref> .<lb/> Oncogenic RAS may contribute to gene instability in cancer via the promotion of G 2 /M phase transition, inhibi-<lb/>tion of G 2 DNA checkpoints, and induction of defects in mitotic spindle checkpoints <ref type="biblio">43</ref> . Herein, by treating the<lb/> MCF-7 cells with the IC 50 of compound 5a the percentage of the cells was significantly arrested at sub-G0/G1<lb/> at a rate of 48.5%, compared with that of the untreated control MCF-7 cells (8.6%). These results confirmed the<lb/> apoptosis of the MCF-7 cells.<lb/></p>

			<p>Blocking of the RAS/PI3K/Akt/JNK signaling pathways in MCF-7 cells by compound 5a. The elucidation of intra-<lb/>cellular signaling pathways and the identification of oncogenes have ushered in a new era of targeted therapy<lb/> that has greatly improved the prognosis for many malignancies. New therapies targeting these proteins and their<lb/> downstream mediators have established their capability to stabilize and shrink tumors <ref type="biblio">44</ref> .<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>RAS oncogenes are the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer, and RAS-mutant malignancies<lb/> account for a significant portion of all human diseases <ref type="biblio">45</ref> . RAS proteins cycle between two conformational states,<lb/> that is, the active form when they are bound to GTP and the inactive form when bound to GDP. Guanine nucleo-<lb/>tide exchange factors (GEFs) are known to stimulate GTP-bound RAS formation, whereas GTPase-activating<lb/> proteins (GAPs) promote GTP hydrolysis on RAS thereby returning them to the inactive state <ref type="biblio">46</ref> . In numerous<lb/> human malignancies, including breast carcinoma, active forms of RAS have been found to induce cellular trans-<lb/>formation. Thus, one of the therapeutic approaches to treating breast cancer is the efficient control of oncogenic<lb/> RAS <ref type="biblio">47</ref> . In this study, western blot analysis revealed that treatment with the IC 50 of 5a significantly decreased the<lb/> levels of p-RAS proteins as compared to the MCF-7 untreated cells. This suggested the antiproliferative nature<lb/> of this novel compound (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4. (Left side) 2D and (right side) 3D represent the interactions of the docked novel synthesized<lb/> pyrimidine-2-thione derivatives with amino acid residues of the H-RAS target protein.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Activated RAS enhances cellular proliferation by modifying a wide range of intracellular effector pathways<lb/> that eventually converge to promote growth and suppress apoptotic signals in transformed cells. The PI3K-Akt<lb/> pathway has been described as a dominant growth survival pathway in breast cancer. The elevation of PI3K-Akt<lb/> signaling is a common mechanism that malignant cells require to proliferate and escape programmed cell death <ref type="biblio">48</ref> .<lb/> Hence, in the present study, we examined the effect of 5a on the RAS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by assessing<lb/> PI3K, Akt, and p21 gene expression as well as p53 protein expression in MCF-7 cells.<lb/></p>

			<p>RAS protein interacts with PI3K, thereby, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of Akt <ref type="biblio">46</ref> . PI3K phos-<lb/>phorylates inositol phospholipids and generates the secondary messenger, phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphos-<lb/>phate (PIP3), which triggers the phosphorylation and activation of the downstream serine/threonine kinase<lb/> Akt. In turn, Akt promotes cell survival by modulating key proteins with various biological functions <ref type="biblio">49</ref> . In this<lb/> study, the IC 50 of 5a treatment significantly reduced mRNA transcript level of PI3K and Akt compared with the<lb/> MCF-7 untreated cells which strongly indicated the inhibitory effect of 5a on the RAS/PI3K/Akt pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Additionally, phosphorylated Akt is a well-established cell survival factor because it downregulates both<lb/> p21 and p53 <ref type="biblio">50</ref> . In this work, the treatment with the IC 50 of 5a significantly upregulated p21 gene expression<lb/> compared with the untreated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Moreover, the immunoblot analysis confirmed a significant eleva-<lb/>tion of p53 protein expression in the 5a-treated cells compared with that in the MCF-7 untreated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 4. (continued)<lb/> After the treatment with 5a, the upregulation of p21 gene expression and p53 protein expression confirmed the<lb/> antineoplastic effect of 5a toward human breast cancer cells by suppressing the RAS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Furthermore, RAS is known to activate the JNK/MAP kinase signaling cascade leading to the phosphorylation<lb/> of c-Jun and augmentation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcriptional activity. Hence, we investigated the<lb/> effect of 5a on the cell survival pathway, that is, the RAS/JNK pathway. Our study showed a significant reduction<lb/> in the p-JNK protein expression when compared with that in the MCF-7 untreated cells suggesting the inhibitory<lb/> effect of 5a on the RAS/JNK pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). These results may have been obtained because JNK contributes to<lb/> the RAS-induced estrogen-independent growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally, the JNK pathway is involved<lb/> in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are associated with extracellular matrix degradation<lb/> and tumor metastasis. Moreover, there is an association between the JNK/c-Jun activation and angiogenesis in<lb/> invasive breast carcinoma <ref type="biblio">51</ref> . Indeed, JNK inhibition can cause apoptosis of tumor cells <ref type="biblio">52</ref> .<lb/> </p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>Pyrimidine-2-thione derivatives 2-6 were successfully synthesized via conventional and ultrasonic irradiation<lb/> techniques. The ultrasonic technique was found to be more effective than conventional heating, as evidenced<lb/> by its higher yields and short reaction times. compound 5a was selected among the others according to their in<lb/> silico molecular free binding energy docking studies towards inhibiting the H-RAS target protein and obeyed<lb/> Lipinski&apos;s rule of five. Additionally, the results of the in vitro studies emphasized that the newly synthesized<lb/> compound 5a induced cell death via targeting the RAS/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, it upregulated<lb/> p21 and p53 proteins in the human breast cancer cells. Finally, compound 5a exhibited antineoplastic activity<lb/> via the inhibition of p-JNK protein in cancer cells. Therefore, 5a appears to be an attractive antitumor compound<lb/> with future clinical applications for breast cancer treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>).<lb/></p>
