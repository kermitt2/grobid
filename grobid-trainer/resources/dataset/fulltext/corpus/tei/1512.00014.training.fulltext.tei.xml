			<head>1 INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>The variable and transient sky offers a window into the most ex-<lb/>treme events that take place in the Universe. Transient phenomena<lb/> are observed at all wavelengths across a diverse range of objects,<lb/> ranging from optical flashes detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter<lb/> caused by bolides (<ref type="biblio">Hueso et al. 2010</ref>), to violent Gamma-Ray<lb/> Bursts (GRBs) at cosmological distances which can outshine their<lb/> host galaxy (<ref type="biblio">Klebesadel et al. 1973; van Paradijs et al. 1997</ref>).<lb/> Observations at radio wavelengths provide a robust method to<lb/> probe these events, supplying unique views of kinetic feedback<lb/> and propagation effects in the interstellar medium, which are also<lb/> just as diverse in their associated time-scales. Active Galactic<lb/> Nuclei (AGN; <ref type="biblio">Matthews &amp; Sandage 1963; Smith &amp; Hoffleit 1963</ref>)<lb/> are known to vary over time-scales of a month or longer, whereas<lb/> observations of the Crab Pulsar have seen radio bursts with a<lb/> duration of nanoseconds (<ref type="biblio">Hankins et al. 2003</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Historically, and still to this day, radio observations have been<lb/> used to follow-up transient detections made at other wavelengths.<lb/> Radio facilities generally had a narrow field-of-view (FoV), which<lb/> made them inadequate to perform rapid transient and variability<lb/> studies over a large fraction of the sky. However, blind transient<lb/> surveys have been performed and have produced intriguing results.<lb/> For example, <ref type="biblio">Bower et al. (2007) (also see Frail et al. 2012</ref>)<lb/> discovered a single epoch millijansky transient at 4.9 GHz while<lb/> searching 944 epochs of archival Very Large Array (VLA) data<lb/> spanning 22 years, with three other possible marginal events. Sky<lb/> surveys using the Nasu Observatory have also been successful<lb/> in finding a radio transient source, with <ref type="biblio">Niinuma et al. (2007)<lb/></ref> having observed a two epoch event, peaking at 3 Jy at 1.42 GHz.<lb/> Various counterparts were considered at other wavelengths, but<lb/> the origin of the transient remains unknown. Lastly, Bannister<lb/> et al. (2011) surveyed 2775 deg 2 of sky at 843 MHz using the<lb/> Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST), yielding 15<lb/> transients at a 5σ level of 14 mJy beam −1 , 12 of which had not<lb/> been previously identified as transient or variable.<lb/></p>

			<p>Surveys at low frequencies ( 330 MHz) have also been<lb/> completed. <ref type="biblio">Lazio et al. (2010)</ref> carried out an all-sky transient<lb/> survey using the Long Wavelength Demonstrator Array (LWDA)<lb/> at 73.8 MHz, which detected no transient events to a flux density<lb/> limit of 500 Jy. In addition, <ref type="biblio">Hyman et al. (2002, 2005, 2006, 2009</ref>)<lb/> discovered three radio transients during monitoring of the Galactic<lb/> centre at 235 and 330 MHz. These were identified by using archival<lb/> VLA observations along with regular monitoring using the VLA<lb/> and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The transients<lb/> had flux densities in the range of 100 mJy–1 Jy and occurred<lb/> on time-scales ranging from minutes to months. Lastly, Jaeger<lb/> et al. (2012) searched six archival epochs from the VLA at 325<lb/> MHz centred on the Spitzer-Space-Telescope Wide-Area Infrared<lb/> Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) Deep Field. In an area of 6.5 deg 2<lb/> to a 10σ flux limit of 2.1 mJy beam −1 , one day-scale transient<lb/> event was reported with a peak flux density of 1.7 mJy beam −1 .<lb/></p>

			<p>Radio transient surveys are being revolutionised by the de-<lb/>velopment of the current generation of radio facilities. These in-<lb/>clude new low-frequency instruments such as the International<lb/> Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR; <ref type="biblio">van Haarlem et al. 2013</ref>), Long<lb/> Wavelength Array (LWA; <ref type="biblio">Ellingson et al. 2013</ref>) and the Murchin-<lb/>son Wide Field Array (MWA; <ref type="biblio">Tingay et al. 2013</ref>). The telescopes<lb/> listed offer a large FoV coupled with an enhanced sensitivity, with<lb/> LOFAR having the capability to reach sub-mJy sensitivities and<lb/> arcsecond resolutions (though this full capability is not used in<lb/> this work as such modes were being commissioned at the time).<lb/> These features are achieved by utilising phased-array technology<lb/> with omnidirectional dipoles, and the before mentioned telescopes<lb/> act as pathfinders for the low-frequency component of the Square<lb/> Kilometre Array (SKA; <ref type="biblio">Dewdney et al. 2009</ref>). With such greatly<lb/> improved sensitivities at low frequencies, we have a new opportu-<lb/>nity to survey wide areas of the sky for transients and variables,<lb/> with a particular sensitivity to coherent bursts.<lb/></p>

			<p>These new facilities have already produced some interesting<lb/> results in this largely unexplored parameter space. <ref type="biblio">Bell et al. (2014)<lb/></ref> searched an area of 1430 deg 2 for transient and variable sources at<lb/> 154 MHz using the MWA. No transients were found with flux den-<lb/>sities &gt; 5.5 Jy on time-scales of 26 minutes and one year. However,<lb/> two sources displayed potential intrinsic variability on a one year<lb/> time-scale. Using the LWA, Obenberger et al. (2014a) detected two<lb/> kilojansky transient events while using an all-sky monitor to search<lb/> for prompt low-frequency emission from GRBs. They were found<lb/> at 37.9 and 29.9 MHz, lasting for 75 and 100 seconds respectively,<lb/> and were not associated with any known GRBs. This was followed<lb/> up by <ref type="biblio">Obenberger et al. (2014b)</ref> who searched over 11 000 hours of<lb/> all-sky images for similar events, yielding 49 candidates, all with<lb/> a duration of tens of seconds. It was discovered that 10 of these<lb/> events correlated both spatially and temporally with large meteors<lb/> (or fireballs). This low-frequency emission from fireballs was pre-<lb/>viously undetected and identifies a new form of naturally occurring<lb/> radio transient foreground.<lb/></p>

			<p>Two transient studies have now also been completed using<lb/> LOFAR. <ref type="biblio">Carbone et al. (2015)</ref> searched 2275 deg 2 of sky at 150<lb/> MHz, at cadences of 15 minutes and several months, with no<lb/> transients reported to a flux limit of 0.5 Jy. <ref type="biblio">Cendes et al. (2015)<lb/></ref> searched through 26, 149-MHz observations centred on the source<lb/> Swift J1644+57, covering 11.35 deg 2 . No transients were found to<lb/> a flux limit of 0.5 Jy on a time-scale of 11 minutes.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this paper we use the LOFAR telescope to search 400 hours<lb/> of observations centred at the North Celestial Pole (NCP; δ = 90 ◦ ),<lb/> covering 175 deg 2 with a bandwidth of 195 kHz at 60 MHz. LO-<lb/>FAR is a low-frequency interferometer operating in the frequency<lb/> ranges of 10–90 MHz and 110–250 MHz. It consists of 46 stations:<lb/> 38 in the Netherlands and 8 in other European countries. Full de-<lb/>tails of the instrument can be found in van <ref type="biblio">Haarlem et al. (2013)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>A previous study of variable radio sources located near the<lb/> NCP field (75 ◦ &lt; δ &lt; 88 ◦ ) was carried out by <ref type="biblio">Mingaliev et al.<lb/> (2009)</ref>. This study identified 15 objects displaying variability at<lb/> centimetre wavelengths on time-scales of days or longer. However,<lb/> the variability amplitude was found to be within seven per cent,<lb/> which we would not be able to distinguish with LOFAR due to<lb/> general calibration uncertainties at the time of writing. In addition,<lb/> the lower observing frequency used in this work would mean that<lb/> the expected peak flux densities would be significantly lower,<lb/> assuming a standard synchrotron event (e.g., van der Laan 1966),<lb/> making them challenging to detect. Also, the lower frequency<lb/> means that the variability would occur over even longer time-<lb/>scales, again assuming that the emission arises from a synchrotron<lb/> process.<lb/></p>

			<p>The observations and processing techniques are discussed in<lb/> Section 2, with a description of how the transient search was per-<lb/>formed in Section 3. The results can be found in Section 4, which<lb/> is followed by a discussion of a discovered transient event in Sec-<lb/></p>

This emphasises further the sometimes fragmented nature of the observing pattern of the NCP, with which careful consideration had to<lb/> be given on how to combine the observations for the transient search.<lb/> </figure>

			<head>2 LOFAR OBSERVATIONS OF THE NCP<lb/></head>

			<p>The monitoring survey of the NCP was performed between 2011<lb/> December 23–2012 April 16, resulting in a total of 2609 observa-<lb/>tions being recorded. The NCP was chosen because it is constantly<lb/> observable from the Northern Hemisphere, and the centre of the<lb/> field is located towards constant azimuth and elevation (az/el) coor-<lb/>dinates. However, this is not true for sources which lie away from<lb/> the NCP, where these sources rotate within the LOFAR elliptical<lb/> beam. We therefore restrict our transient search to an area around<lb/> the NCP where the LOFAR station beam properties are consistent<lb/> for each epoch observed, avoiding systematic errors in the light<lb/> curves that might be introduced if this was not the case. It is also an<lb/> advantage that the line-of-sight (b=122 ◦ .93, l=+27 ◦ .13) is located<lb/> towards a relatively low column density of Galactic free electrons;<lb/> the maximum expected dispersion measure (DM) is 55 pc cm −3 ac-<lb/>cording to the NE2001 model of the Galactic free electron distribu-<lb/>tion (<ref type="biblio">Cordes &amp; Lazio 2003</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The NCP measurements were taken using the LOFAR Low-<lb/>Band Antennas (LBA) at a single frequency of 60 MHz; the band-<lb/>width was 195 kHz, consisting of 64 channels. The total integration<lb/> time of each snapshot was 11 min, sampled at 1 s intervals, and data<lb/> were recorded using the &apos;LBA_INNER&apos; setup, where the beam is<lb/> formed using the innermost 46 LBA antennas from each station,<lb/> which gives the largest possible FoV and a full width half maxi-<lb/>mum (FWHM) of 9.77 ◦ .<lb/></p>

			<head>2.1 Observation epochs<lb/></head>

			<p>The programme piggybacked on another commissioning project<lb/> being performed by LOFAR at the time, the Multifrequency Snap-<lb/>shot Sky Survey (MSSS) – the first major LOFAR observing<lb/> project surveying the low-frequency sky (<ref type="biblio">Heald et al. 2015</ref>). With<lb/> every single MSSS LBA observation that took place, a beam was<lb/> placed on the NCP using one subband of the full observational<lb/> setup for MSSS. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows a histogram of the number of NCP<lb/> snapshots observed each day over the duration of the programme,<lb/> in addition to a similar histogram showing the number of snapshots<lb/> per hour for a particular set of days. Of the 2609 snapshots, 909<lb/> were recorded during the day and 1700 were recorded at night. The<lb/> MSSS observational set-up also meant that each 11-minute snap-<lb/>shot in the same observation block was separated by a time gap of<lb/> four minutes.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2 Calibration and imaging<lb/></head>

			<p>Prior to any processing, radio-frequency interference (RFI) was re-<lb/>moved using AOFLAGGER (<ref type="biblio">Offringa et al. 2010, 2012a</ref>,b) with a<lb/> default strategy, in addition, the two channels at the highest, and<lb/> lowest, frequency edges of the measurement set were also com-<lb/>pletely flagged, reducing the bandwidth to 183 kHz. When using<lb/> an automatic flagging tool such as AOFLAGGER, it is important<lb/> to be aware of the fact that transient sources could be mistakenly<lb/> identified as RFI by the software. This is a complex issue which<lb/> is beyond the scope of this work. However, an initial investigation<lb/> for the LOFAR case was carried out by <ref type="biblio">Cendes et al. (2015)</ref>. In<lb/> these tests, simulated transient sources, described by a step func-<lb/>tion, with different flux densities and time durations (from seconds<lb/> to minutes), were injected into an 11 minute dataset. These datasets<lb/> were subsequently passed through AOFLAGGER before calibrating<lb/> and imaging as normal in order to observe how the simulated tran-<lb/>sient was affected by the automatic flagging, if at all. The authors<lb/> concluded that transient signals shorter than a duration of two min-<lb/>utes could be partially, or in the case of ∼Jansky level sources,<lb/> completely flagged. However, there are some caveats to this test-<lb/>ing: short time-scale imaging was not tested for short-duration tran-<lb/>sients, and it remains to be determined how the automatic flagging<lb/> would treat other types of transients (i.e. a non step function event).<lb/> Hence, while these results certainly suggest that transients could be<lb/> affected by AOFLAGGER, further testing is required to completely<lb/> understand how automatic flagging software can affect the detec-<lb/>tion of a transient.<lb/></p>

			<p>At this stage we also removed all data from international LO-<lb/>FAR stations, leaving just the Dutch stations. This was due to the<lb/> complex challenges in reducing these corresponding data at the<lb/> time of processing. Following this, the &apos;demixing&apos; technique (de-<lb/>scribed by van der <ref type="biblio">Tol et al. 2007</ref>) was used to remove the effects of<lb/> the bright sources Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A from the visibilities.<lb/> Finally, averaging in frequency and time was performed such that<lb/> each observation consisted of 1 channel and an integration time of<lb/> 10 seconds per time step. The averaging of the data was necessary<lb/> to reduce the data volume and computing time required to process<lb/> the data.<lb/></p> 

			<p>This averaging has the potential to introduce effects caused<lb/> by bandwidth and time smearing, which are discussed in more<lb/> detail by <ref type="biblio">Heald et al. (2015)</ref> in relation to MSSS data. Following<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Heald et al. (2015)</ref>, we used the approximations given by <ref type="biblio">Bridle &amp;<lb/> Schwab (1999)</ref> to calculate the magnitude of the flux loss (S/S0)<lb/> in each case, assuming a projected baseline length of 10 km. We<lb/> found the bandwidth smearing factor to equal seven per cent (using<lb/> a field radius corresponding to the FWHM) and a time smearing<lb/> factor of 0.4 per cent. Thus, while the effect of time smearing<lb/> was negligible, the impact of bandwidth smearing was potentially<lb/> significant, yet remained within the calibration error margins (10<lb/> per cent; see Section 4.1).<lb/></p>

			<p>A selection of flux calibrators, characterised by <ref type="biblio">Scaife &amp;<lb/> Heald (2012)</ref> 1 , were used in the main processing of the data and<lb/> were observed simultaneously utilising LOFAR&apos;s multi-beam<lb/> capability (thus the calibrator scans were also 11 minutes in<lb/> length). The calibrators and their usage can be found in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.<lb/> The standard LOFAR imaging pipeline was then implemented<lb/> which consists of the following steps. Firstly, the amplitude and<lb/> phase gain solutions, using XX and YY correlations, are obtained<lb/> for each calibrator observation using Black Board Selfcal (BBS;<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Pandey et al. 2009</ref>). These solutions are direction-independent, and<lb/> are derived for each time step using the full set of visibilities from<lb/> the Dutch stations, as well as a point source model of the calibrator<lb/> itself. Beam calibration was also enabled which accounts, and<lb/> corrects, for elevation and azimuthal effects with the station beam.<lb/> The amplitudes of these gain solutions were then clipped to a 3σ<lb/> level to remove significant outliers, which were not uncommon in<lb/> these early LOFAR data. The gain solutions were then transferred<lb/> directly from the calibrators to the respective NCP observation.<lb/></p>

			<p>Secondly, a phase-only calibration step was performed (also<lb/> using BBS) to calibrate the phase in the direction of the target<lb/></p> 

			<table>Table 1. Table listing the calibrators used for the NCP observations. It was<lb/> decided early in the MSSS programme that 3C 48 and 3C 147 might not<lb/> be adequate as calibrators for the LBA portion of the survey, and so these<lb/> were dropped 8 and 22 days after first use, respectively. Observations using<lb/> these calibrators displayed no disadvantages over those observed with other<lb/> calibrators when checked in this project, and hence they were kept as part<lb/> of the sample.<lb/> Calibrator Source % Use First Use Date Last Use Date<lb/> 3C 48<lb/> 2%<lb/> 2011 Dec 24<lb/> 2012 Jan 01<lb/> 3C 147<lb/> 6%<lb/> 2011 Dec 23<lb/> 2012 Jan 14<lb/> 3C 196<lb/> 43%<lb/> 2011 Dec 24<lb/> 2012 Apr 14<lb/> 3C 295<lb/> 40%<lb/> 2011 Dec 24<lb/> 2012 Apr 01<lb/> Cygnus A<lb/> 9%<lb/> 2012 Jan 28<lb/> 2012 Apr 16<lb/></table>

			<p>field. The solutions were derived using data within a maximum<lb/> projected uv distance of 4000λ (20 km; 24 core + 10 remote sta-<lb/> tions). In order to perform this step, a sky model was obtained of<lb/> the NCP field using data from the global sky model (GSM) de-<lb/> veloped by <ref type="biblio">Scheers (2011)</ref>. This model is constructed by firstly<lb/> gathering sources which are present within a set radius from the<lb/> target pointing in the 74 MHz VLA Low-Frequency Sky Survey<lb/> (VLSS; <ref type="biblio">Cohen et al. 2007</ref>). In the NCP case, the radius was set to<lb/> 10 deg. From this basis, sources are then cross-correlated, using a<lb/> source association radius of 10 arcsec, with the 325 MHz Wester-<lb/> bork Northern Sky Survey (WENSS; <ref type="biblio">Rengelink et al. 1997</ref>) and the<lb/> 1400 MHz NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; <ref type="biblio">Condon et al. 1998</ref>)<lb/> to obtain spectral index information. In those cases where no match<lb/> was found, the spectral index, α (using the definition S ν ∝ ν α ),<lb/> was set to a canonical value of α = −0.7. No self-calibration was<lb/> performed on the data. The reader is referred to <ref type="biblio">van Haarlem et al.<lb/> (2013)</ref> for more LOFAR standard pipeline information.<lb/></p>

			<p>The main MSSS project discovered that observations recorded<lb/> during this 2011-2012 period potentially contained one or more bad<lb/> stations, and the data quality would improve if such stations were<lb/> removed. LOFAR was still very much in its infancy at the time,<lb/> and, as a result, was not entirely stable; problems such as network<lb/> connection issues or bad digital beam forming contributed to the<lb/> poor performance of some stations. Hence, an automated tool was<lb/> developed which analysed each station, identifying and flagging<lb/> those that displayed a significant number of baselines with high<lb/> measured noise. This tool was utilised in the NCP processing and<lb/> primarily removed stations with poorly-focussed beam responses<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Heald et al. 2015</ref>). It should be noted that present LOFAR data<lb/> no longer require this tool as the issues outlined above have been<lb/> rectified.<lb/></p>

			<p>Finally, a FoV of 175 deg 2 was imaged using the AWIMAGER<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Tasse et al. 2013</ref>), with a robust weighting parameter of 0 (<ref type="biblio">Briggs<lb/> 1995</ref>), and a primary-beam (PB) correction applied to each image.<lb/> A maximum projected baseline length of 10 km was used in this<lb/> study (2000λ; 24 core + 7 remote stations). This was chosen to<lb/> obtain good uv coverage and a maximum resolution for which we<lb/> were confident with the calibration. The typical resolution for the<lb/> 11-minute snapshots was 5.4 × 2.3 arcmin.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3 Quality control<lb/></head>

			<p>A number of bad-quality observations were detected and subse-<lb/>quently flagged using two methods: (i) checking the processed visi-<lb/>bilities and (ii) inspecting the final images for each 11-minute snap-<lb/>shot. When analysing the visibilities, poor snapshots were flagged<lb/> when the calibrated visibilities had a mean value greater than the<lb/> overall mean of the entire four month dataset plus one standard de-<lb/>viation value. A slight, or indeed dramatic rise in the mean of the<lb/> visibilities does not necessarily imply a completely bad dataset: an<lb/> extremely bright transient ( &gt; 100 Jy) could have this effect, for ex-<lb/>ample. Such events may have been previously seen from flare stars<lb/> at low frequencies (<ref type="biblio">Abdul-Aziz et al. 1995</ref>), although at shorter<lb/> time-scales than 11 minutes (∼1 s). However, overall, the survey is<lb/> less sensitive to extremely bright events because of this quality con-<lb/>trol step. It was beyond the scope of this project to fully investigate<lb/> this possible effect, and so we decided to only use measurement<lb/> sets that were deemed to be sufficiently well calibrated.<lb/> </p>

			<p>The results from the automated flagging were also checked<lb/> against a manual analysis of the visibility plots and the snapshot<lb/> images, the latter enabling the detection of more bad observations.<lb/> In total, 460 (out of 2609) snapshots were marked as bad, and were<lb/> discarded from the search. The large size of the full dataset meant<lb/> that there was no single common reason as to why individual snap-<lb/>shots were rejected, but the problems that caused rejection were<lb/> mostly due to RFI or ionospheric issues. After the quality control<lb/> was completed, 2149 observations (394 hr) were considered in the<lb/> analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>3 TRANSIENT &amp; VARIABILITY SEARCH METHOD<lb/> </head>

			<head>3.1 Time-scales searched<lb/></head>

			<p>As the properties of the target transient population are unknown,<lb/> the complete dataset was split and combined in various ways to<lb/> fully explore the transient parameter space available. Along with<lb/> performing a search on the original snapshots, each with an inte-<lb/>gration time of 11 minutes, searches were also performed on im-<lb/>ages with integration times of 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 55 minutes<lb/> and 297 minutes. For the longer-duration images, only those 11-<lb/>minute snapshots which were four minutes apart were combined<lb/> together and imaged. This was to keep the visibilities as continu-<lb/>ous as possible in the search for transients. After the quality control<lb/> step described in Section 2.3, 297 minutes was the longest contin-<lb/>uous integration time possible. All calibration was performed on<lb/> each individual 11-minute snapshot; for the longer time-scales the<lb/> relevant datasets were combined and then imaged.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2 The Transients Pipeline<lb/></head>

			<p>The analysis of the data and search for radio transients was per-<lb/>formed using software developed by the LOFAR Transients Key<lb/> Science Project, named the Transients Pipeline (TRAP). It is built<lb/> to search for transients in the image plane, whilst also storing light<lb/> curves and variability statistics of all detected sources. Moreover,<lb/> it is designed to cope with large datasets containing thousands of<lb/> sources such as this NCP project. A full and detailed overview of<lb/> the TRAP can be found in <ref type="biblio">Swinbank et al. (2015)</ref> 2 . In brief it per-<lb/>forms the following steps:<lb/> </p>

			<item>(i) Input images are passed through the TRAP quality control<lb/> which examines two features of the images. Firstly, the rms<lb/> of the map is compared against the expected theoretical<lb/> rms of the observation, and if the ratio between the ob-<lb/>served and theoretical rms is above a set threshold then the<lb/> image is flagged as bad. In this case, the threshold was set<lb/> to the mean ratio value of each time-scale plus one stan-<lb/>dard deviation. The second test involves checking that the<lb/> beam is not excessively elliptical by comparing the ratio<lb/> of the major and minor axes. If this value is over a set<lb/> threshold then the image is also flagged as bad. All bad<lb/> images are then rejected and are not analysed by the TRAP<lb/> (see Rowlinson et al. in prep. for methods of setting these<lb/> thresholds). The number of images accepted by the TRAP<lb/> compared to the total entered can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.<lb/> </item>

			<item>(ii) Sources are extracted using PYSE -a specially developed<lb/> source extractor for use in the TRAP (<ref type="biblio">Spreeuw 2010, Car-<lb/>bone et al. in prep</ref>). Importantly, all sources are initially<lb/> extracted as unresolved point sources, which would be ex-<lb/>pected from a transient event.<lb/> </item>

			<item>(iii) For each image, the source extraction data are analysed<lb/> to associate each source with previous detections of the<lb/> same source, such that a light curve is constructed. In cases<lb/> where no previous source is associated with an extraction,<lb/> the source is flagged as a potential &apos;new source&apos; and is con-<lb/>tinually monitored from the detection epoch onwards.<lb/> </item>

			<p>For the source extraction, we define an island threshold, which de-<lb/>fines the region in which source fitting is performed, and a detection<lb/> threshold where only islands with peaks above this value are con-<lb/>sidered. These island and detection thresholds were set to 5σ and<lb/> 10σ respectively. While the use of a 10σ detection threshold may<lb/> seem very conservative, we agree with the arguments presented by<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Metzger et al. (2015)</ref> (hereafter <ref type="biblio">MWB15</ref>) who advocate this crite-<lb/>ria when identifying a transient source. In their paper, the authors&apos;<lb/> main motivation for this high threshold is the significant possibility<lb/> of spurious signals such as those seen in previous radio transient<lb/> searches (<ref type="biblio">Gal-Yam et al. 2006; Ofek et al. 2010; Croft et al. 2011;<lb/> Frail et al. 2012; Aoki et al. 2014</ref>), arising from calibration arte-<lb/>facts, residual sidelobes and other similar issues. We share these<lb/> concerns, in addition to be being generally cautious as this survey<lb/> is one of the first conducted with the new LOFAR telescope. As<lb/> also stated by <ref type="biblio">MWB15</ref>, previous surveys have used 5σ as a detec-<lb/>tion threshold, which will of course increase the number of poten-<lb/>tial transient detections; however, this will also yield a high number<lb/> of false detections, especially with the large number of epochs be-<lb/>ing used in this survey. Thus, minimising false detections and ob-<lb/>taining a manageable number of transient candidates were further<lb/> motivations to use a 10σ detection threshold. We refer the reader to<lb/> <ref type="biblio">MWB15</ref> for further discussion on this topic.<lb/></p>

			<p>The transient search was also constrained to within a circular<lb/> area of radius 7.5 deg from the centre of the image. This was to<lb/> avoid the outer part of the image which was much noisier and did<lb/> not have reliable flux calibration.<lb/></p>

			<p>For each lightcurve, two values are calculated in order to de-<lb/>fine whether a source is a likely transient or variable: Vν , a co-<lb/>efficient of variation, and ην , the significance of the variability<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Scheers 2011</ref>). Vν is defined as<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1 Image quality<lb/></head>

			<p>Examples of the 30 s, 11 min and 297 min time-scale images can be<lb/> found in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Note that imaging the NCP can sometimes cause<lb/> confusion when displaying the right ascension (RA) and declina-<lb/>tion (Dec) on the image axis, as the grid lines become circular. The<lb/> grid lines are shown in all figures to help demonstrate this. The<lb/> obtained uv coverage of the 11 and 297 min observations can be<lb/> viewed in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. The average sensitivity reached with each time-<lb/>scale is summarised in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, along with the number of epochs<lb/> available after the quality control described in Sections 2 and 3.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is important to note that, as a consequence of the primary<lb/> beam correction, search areas centred on the NCP do not have a<lb/> uniform noise level. Larger search areas include noisier regions fur-<lb/></p>

			<p>ther from the phase centre, and hence the flux density threshold at<lb/> which we could detect a transient across the full search area will<lb/> be higher. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows an example of a primary beam map from<lb/> one of the NCP observations. In order to obtain a noise estimate<lb/> accounting for the variation caused by the beam, for each image at<lb/> each time-scale we split the area into four annuli, equally spaced in<lb/> radius. These four regions are also marked on <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. The rms for<lb/> each annulus was then measured, using a clipping technique, with<lb/> the area-weighted average of these four values providing the single<lb/> value rms estimate for the individual image. We then took the av-<lb/>erage of each time-scale, which are used as our sensitivity levels in<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows that these measured rms values of the dif-<lb/>ferent time-scales approximately follow a 1/<lb/> √<lb/> t relation, where t<lb/> represents the integration time of the observation. We note that the<lb/> longer time-scale rms values appear to lie above the 1/<lb/> √<lb/> t relation.<lb/> We believe this is caused by the clipping technique being less ac-<lb/>curate at measuring the rms of the longer time-scale images annuli.<lb/> This in itself due to the presence of many more sources compared<lb/> to the relatively source free short time-scale images. In addition to<lb/> this, it is possible the CLEAN algorithm was not applied to a deep<lb/> enough level in some cases. Hence, the combination of these two<lb/> methods means that the longer time-scale rms values are likely to<lb/> be slightly overestimated, but not at a concerning level in the con-<lb/>text of this investigation.<lb/></p>

			<p>We could have limited the transient search to a smaller region<lb/> with the deepest sensitivity; however, when calculating the figure<lb/> of merit (FoM, ∝ Ωs − 3<lb/> 2 where Ω is the FoV and s is the sensi-<lb/>tivity) it can be shown that it is more beneficial to extend the area<lb/> of the search, despite the increase in average rms. This can easily<lb/> be demonstrated as the full area is 16 times larger but the weighted<lb/> sensitivity only drops by a factor of about two; hence the FoM is<lb/> around five times better, illustrating the motivation for searching<lb/> wide area. We refer the reader to <ref type="biblio">Macquart (2014)</ref> for an in-depth<lb/> discussion of the FoM in the context of transient surveys.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The 55 and 297 min time-scale images offered the best flux<lb/> calibration stability from image to image due to the better uv cov-<lb/>erage achieved on these time-scales. An example of the general flux<lb/> calibration quality can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, which shows the aver-<lb/>aged measured flux across all the 297 minute snapshots of sources<lb/> detected at 60 MHz, cross-matched with the VLSS catalogue at 74<lb/> MHz. It shows a general agreement with the fluxes that would be<lb/> expected assuming an average spectral index of α = −0.7. If we<lb/> assume that all sources have this spectral index and calculate the<lb/></p>

			<p>expected VLSS 60 MHz flux for each source, we find that the aver-<lb/>age ratio of this expected VLSS flux against the measured LOFAR<lb/> flux is 1.00 ± 0.17.<lb/></p>

			<p>Overall there was a typical scatter of 10 per cent in each<lb/> light-curve of sources detected, which was measured by the TRAP.<lb/> It was common that fainter sources (&lt; 10σ) would appear to<lb/> &apos;blink&apos; in and out of images; this was especially apparent in the 11<lb/> minute snapshots. This was likely due to a mixture of varying rms<lb/> levels and the ionosphere causing phase calibration issues. Such<lb/> behaviour was a further reason why a 10σ source detection limit<lb/> was used in the transient search. The sensitivities of the shortest<lb/> time-scale maps, 30 s and 2 min, were such that only the brightest<lb/> source in the field, 3C 61.1, was detectable. The LOFAR and VLSS<lb/> source positions were also consistent within 5.1 arcsec on average;<lb/> the typical resolution in the LOFAR band is 3.1 × 1.4 arcmin for<lb/> the 297 min time-scale.<lb/></p>

			<p>It was also important to determine whether the images pro-<lb/>duced for the transient search are confusion limited. In order to<lb/> calculate an estimate of the confusion noise for the average res-<lb/>olutions presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we followed the same approach as<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Heald et al. (2015)</ref>, using VLSS C-configuration estimates (see <ref type="biblio">Co-<lb/>hen 2004</ref>) which we extrapolate to 60 MHz using a typical spectral<lb/> index of −0.7. We also alter the formula to account for the non-<lb/>circular beams:<lb/></p>

			<formula>σconf,VLSS = 29<lb/> θ1 × θ2<lb/> 1<lb/> 0.77<lb/> 60 MHz<lb/> 74 MHz<lb/> −0.7<lb/> µJy beam −1 ,<lb/> (3)<lb/></formula>

			<p>where θ1 is the synthesized beam size major axis and θ2 is<lb/> the minor axis. For the five time-scales used in the transient<lb/> search shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, beginning with 30 sec, we calculate the<lb/> confusion noise estimates to be 113, 107, 128, 111 and 57 mJy<lb/> beam −1 respectively. Thus, due to our simple reduction strategy,<lb/> our images, at best, are approximately 4× the confusion noise<lb/> level and hence would not affect our transient search.<lb/></p>

			<p>Along with these cadences, a deep map was constructed by<lb/> using all the available 297 min images, reaching a sensitivity of 71<lb/> mJy beam −1 (this value was measured using the weighted average<lb/> method discussed above in this section). This map can be seen in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. This, however, had to be produced by means of image<lb/> stacking as opposed to direct imaging due to the amount of data in-<lb/>volved. A total of 150 sources were detected at a 10σ level within<lb/> the same 7.5 deg radius circle used for the transient search, with the<lb/> map primarily being used as a deep reference image for the field.<lb/> We can, however, use this deep map to verify our calibration and<lb/> imaging procedures by comparing our detected source counts to the<lb/></p>

			<p>VLSS. Firstly, using a spectral index of −0.7, S60 = 710 mJy cor-<lb/>responds to a flux density at 74 MHz of S74 = 613 mJy. Using this<lb/> flux density limit, there are 263 catalogued VLSS sources within<lb/> 7.5 deg of the phase centre. Cross-correlating the VLSS with our<lb/> LOFAR 60 MHz detections, we find that 41 per cent of the VLSS<lb/> sources have a LOFAR match. The factor of ∼ 2 discrepancy can<lb/> be shown to be simply due to the primary beam attenuation in our<lb/> deep map. Hence, we were satisfied that the calibration and imag-<lb/>ing results were valid and consistent with previous studies, and<lb/> therefore would not negatively impact any transient searches.<lb/></p>

The deepest map produced of the NCP field from the survey. It<lb/> was constructed by averaging all 31 of the 297-minute-duration images to-<lb/>gether in the image plane, using inverse-variance weighting.

While none of these sources are previously<lb/> undetected, it provided a detailed reference map to check any transient can-<lb/>didates. The colour bar units are Jy beam −1 .<lb/></figure>

			<p>This map was also further analysed for any previously un-<lb/>catalogued radio sources, but none were found. However, the di-<lb/>rect comparison to VLSS revealed that one source, located at<lb/> 02 h 13 m 28 s +84 ◦ 04 18 , has apparently significantly different 60<lb/> and 74 MHz flux densities: the VLSS integrated flux density is 1.49<lb/> Jy (possibly put in the error), whereas in the LOFAR band it is de-<lb/>tected at the 8σ level with a integrated flux density of 236 mJy.<lb/> There are no detections of the source in WENSS or NVSS. How-<lb/>ever, this source is located within a stripe feature in the VLSS im-<lb/>age, and the source is not present in the VLSS Redux catalogue<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">VLSSr; Lane et al. 2014</ref>); hence we do not pursue this source fur-<lb/>ther. The full MSSS survey will offer further insight into this po-<lb/>tential source, confirming its flux density and spectral index, if it is<lb/> real.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 Variability search results<lb/></head>

			<p>The four month dataset provides an opportunity to search for<lb/> variable sources as well as transient sources. We define variables<lb/> as sources which are present throughout the entire dataset, taking<lb/> into consideration varying sensitivity, whose light curve displays<lb/> significant variability over the period. This is opposed to transient<lb/> sources, which we define as sources that appear or disappear<lb/> during the time spanned by the dataset, again taking into account<lb/> the varying sensitivity. Consulting historical catalogues also helps<lb/> with the distinction between variables and transients. Due to the<lb/> higher level of image quality, the variability search was limited to<lb/> the two longest time-scales of 55 and 297 min. For each detected<lb/> source in these two sets of images, variability parameters (Vν and<lb/> ην ) were calculated by the TRAP. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> shows the respective<lb/> distributions of the variability parameters for each time-scale<lb/> plotted in logarithmic space. In each case, the central panel shows<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 8. This figure shows the distribution of values obtained for the vari-<lb/>ability parameters Vν , a coefficient of variation, and ην , the significance of<lb/> the variability (see text for full definitions) for each light-curve detected.<lb/> The upper panel shows the 55-minute image results and the lower panel<lb/> shows the 297-minute time-scale results. In each case, the central panel<lb/> plots the two values against each other for each source, with the top panel<lb/> and right side panel displaying the histogram showing the distribution of<lb/> the ην and Vν values respectively for all sources. The dotted lines repre-<lb/>sent a 3σ threshold for each parameter. A very-likely variable or transient<lb/> source would appear in the top-right of the plot, exceeding a 3σ level in<lb/> each parameter. At both time-scales, one source (3C 61.1) is found to have<lb/> a significant value in ην . However this is likely to arise from fluctuations<lb/> caused by calibration issues.<lb/></figure> 

			<p>ην plotted against Vν for each detected source. The top panel<lb/> displays a histogram representing the distribution of ην of all<lb/> the sources along with a fitted Gaussian curve. The right panel<lb/> contains the distribution and fitted Gaussian curve for Vν . The<lb/> dashed lines represent a 3σ threshold for each value; any sources<lb/> with variability parameters exceeding one or both of these values<lb/> are considered as potentially variable. Candidates also had to show<lb/> a variability of significantly more than ten per cent, which was<lb/> the calibrator error of the measurements. This was set at a level<lb/> of 2σ from this value. An ideal transient would appear in the<lb/> top-right-hand corner of the central panel scatter plot, exceeding<lb/> the threshold in each parameter.<lb/></p>

			<p>It can be seen that at both time-scales, no sources exhibit vari-<lb/>able behaviour in Vν above a 3σ level, but one source has a signifi-<lb/>cant ην value. This source is 3C 61.1, which dominates the field.<lb/> While the result points towards low-level variability of 3C 61.1,<lb/> the source is a well resolved radio galaxy (<ref type="biblio">Leahy &amp; Perley 1991</ref>)<lb/> whose flux is dominated by 100-kpc-scale lobes, making it very<lb/> unlikely that we would detect any intrinsic variability. It is more<lb/> likely that this is the result of calibration errors and the source<lb/> extraction and subsequent calculation of ην itself. The model for<lb/> 3C 61.1 used during this investigation is quite basic for such a com-<lb/>plex source. This, along with ionospheric effects and the general<lb/> calibration accuracy of the instrument at the time, can have quite<lb/> a substantial effect on such a bright source, with such calibration<lb/> errors not included in this analysis. The source is also spatially ex-<lb/>tended, but the extraction treats it as a point source (as mentioned<lb/> in Section 3), and this will therefore also have a significant impact<lb/> on the recorded flux. Removing the point source fitting constraint<lb/> does indeed move the data point closer back towards the 3σ thresh-<lb/>old, but only marginally by 0.1 dex in ην . As for the ην value,<lb/> this parameter is weighted by the flux errors of the source extrac-<lb/>tion. Bright sources, such as 3C 61.1, are well fitted when they are<lb/> extracted, which means they have small associated statistical flux<lb/> errors. This in turn then causes ην to rise. If we discount 3C 61.1,<lb/> no sources displayed any significant variability at the 55 and 297<lb/> minute time-scales.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 Transient search results<lb/></head>

			<p>Using the TRAP and a manual analysis of its results, searches<lb/> performed on the time-scales of 0.5, 2, 55 and 297 minutes<lb/> found no transient candidates. However, nine transient candidates<lb/> emerged from the analysis of the 11-minute time-scale. At first<lb/> it appeared strange to achieve nine candidates at one time-scale<lb/> but none at any other. However, the sensitivity of the shorter<lb/> time-scales was such that only bright transients (&gt; 25 Jy) would<lb/> have been confidently detected, and as previously stated no other<lb/> source, or even artefact, was detected at these flux levels other<lb/> than 3C 61.1. At the longer time-scales, the improved uv coverage<lb/> meant that the images improved substantially in quality. This<lb/> reduced the number of imaging artefacts that could spawn false<lb/> detections and sources were consistently detected throughout<lb/> the epochs (as opposed to many sources blinking in and out as<lb/> discussed in Section 4.1). Any sources that were defined as &apos;new&apos;<lb/> by the TRAP (sources which appeared that were not detected in the<lb/> first image) were in fact association errors and not transient sources.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the nine candidates could point towards the 11 minute<lb/> images meeting the required sensitivity and time-scale of a tran-<lb/>sient population, these images are also the most likely to exhibit<lb/> misleading artefacts due to the limited uv coverage. Hence, the nine<lb/> reported candidates were subjected to a series of tests to determine<lb/> whether they were spurious sources. The following tests were per-<lb/>formed:<lb/></p>

			<item>(i) Subtraction of 3C 61.1 from the visibilities using the clean<lb/> component model from the deconvolution process. The<lb/> visibilities were then re-imaged.<lb/></item> 

			<item>(ii) Applying an extra round of RFI removal using AOFLAG-<lb/>GER.<lb/></item>

			<item>(iii) Re-running the automated tool to remove perceived bad<lb/> LOFAR stations from the observations, followed by a man-<lb/>ual check.<lb/></item> 

			<item>(iv) Imaging the data using different weighting schemes and<lb/> baseline cutoffs.<lb/></item> 

			<p>The tests were applied in the above order, meaning that if one<lb/> method definitely succeeded in removing the candidate the latter<lb/> tests were not performed. Only one of the nine candidates com-<lb/>pletely survived all the tests; three were inconclusive but quite<lb/> doubtful, whereas four were definite artefacts. One other source<lb/> was very marginal in passing all the tests; hence this event is not<lb/> presented in this paper, but will be discussed in a future publica-<lb/>tion. The surviving candidate was thus a potential real astrophysical<lb/> event and is the subject of the following Section 5.<lb/></p>

			<head>5 TRANSIENT CANDIDATE ILT J225347+862146<lb/></head>

			<p>The only candidate to have passed all the validity checks, was found<lb/> in a single 11 min snapshot taken on 2011 December 24 at 04:33<lb/> UTC.

It was only seen in<lb/> this one snapshot with no detection of the source in the preceding<lb/> or subsequent snapshots. The observation can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.<lb/> Nothing was present at the candidate position in either the rela-<lb/>tively deep image constructed from the longer time-scale images<lb/> (see Section 4.1) or the very deep image of the field from the LO-<lb/>FAR Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) group (<ref type="biblio">Yatawatta et al. 2013</ref>).<lb/> Note that the EoR project uses the LOFAR high-band antennas,<lb/> and hence it is at a higher frequency range of 115–163 MHz.<lb/></p>

			<p>On closer inspection, the transient candidate appeared to have a<lb/> secondary associated positive &apos;ghost&apos; source mirrored across the<lb/> brightest source in the field, 3C 61.1 (the transient lies at an angular<lb/> distance of 3.2 ◦ from 3C 61.1), which can also be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>.<lb/> This ghost was not detected by TRAP due to the higher rms value<lb/> in that region, and like the transient candidate it was a &apos;new&apos; source<lb/> with no previous or subsequent detections. In fact the ghost source<lb/> was actually nominally brighter than the transient source with a flux<lb/> density of 13 Jy. However, in the non-primary-beam-corrected map<lb/> the candidate has a higher peak flux density (9 Jy) than the ghost<lb/> (6 Jy). This was not the first time we had witnessed this type of ef-<lb/>fect in LOFAR observations, with previous commissioning data we<lb/> had obtained in 2010 showing a similar situation. Currently, the ex-<lb/>act explanation of why ghosts of this nature, including specifically<lb/> the ghost presented in this work, are generated in LOFAR data is<lb/> unknown. It should be noted that none of the other eight transient<lb/> candidates detailed previously had an associated ghost source. In<lb/> the following discussions we refer to the original detected transient<lb/> source ILT J225347+862146, to the west of 3C 61.1, as the &apos;tran-<lb/>sient candidate&apos; and the source to the east of 3C 61.1 as the &apos;ghost&apos;<lb/> source (refer to <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.1 Ghost artefacts in radio interferometry<lb/></head>

			<p>Calibration artefacts presenting themselves as spurious &apos;ghost&apos;<lb/> sources is not an entirely new topic to radio interferometry. The<lb/> topic of &apos;spurious symmetrisation&apos; is discussed in <ref type="biblio">Cornwell &amp;<lb/> Fomalont (1999)</ref>; in brief, if a point source model is used for<lb/> a slightly resolved source, a single iteration of self-calibration<lb/> can result in features of the image being reflected relative to the<lb/> point-like object. However, this can be corrected with further<lb/> iterations of self-calibration which would cause the spurious<lb/> features to disappear. As will be discussed in Section 5.1.2, the<lb/> ghost presented in this work can be seen before initiating any kind<lb/> of self-calibration of the target field, i.e. any calibration using a<lb/> target field sky model. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the<lb/> spurious symmetrisation previously described is the sole cause of<lb/> the ghost. However, this is not to say that the effect plays no role<lb/> in its creation.<lb/></p>

			<p>More recently, <ref type="biblio">Grobler et al. (2014)</ref> (hereafter &apos;G14&apos;) began a<lb/> series of investigations dedicated to ghost phenomena. This first<lb/> study concentrated on ghosts seen in data from the Westerbork<lb/> Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). In these data, ghost sources<lb/> appeared as strings of (usually) negative point sources passing<lb/> through the dominant source(s) in the field. The arrangement of<lb/> these negative point sources appeared quite regular, along with the<lb/> fact that the positions were not affected by frequency. In their inves-<lb/>tigation, G14 were successful in deriving a theoretical framework<lb/> to predict the appearance of ghosts in WSRT data for a two-source<lb/> scenario, and were able to confirm what previous work had sug-<lb/>gested concerning these ghost sources (see text in G14).<lb/></p>

			<p>In brief, the main features about ghosts to note are as follows:<lb/> (i) they are associated with incomplete sky models, for example<lb/> missing or incorrect flux; (ii) in the WSRT case, the ghosts always<lb/> formed in a line passing through the poorly modelled or unmod-<lb/>elled source(s) and the dominant source(s) in the field; (iii) the<lb/> ghosts are mostly negative in flux, while positive ghosts are rare<lb/> and weaker; and (iv) the general ghost mechanism can also explain<lb/> the observed flux suppression of unmodelled sources.<lb/></p> 

			<p>G14 also concluded that the simple East-West geometry of the<lb/> WSRT array is the reason for ghosts appearing in a regular, straight<lb/> line, pattern. This becomes more complex when a fully 2D/3D ar-<lb/>ray is considered such as LOFAR, where the ghost pattern is ex-<lb/>pected to become a lot more scattered and noise-like. This subject<lb/> will be the focus of Paper II (<ref type="biblio">Wijnholds et al. in prep.</ref>) in the se-<lb/>ries on ghost sources. However, G14 did note that regardless of the<lb/> array geometry, ghosts are expected to occur at the nφ0 positions,<lb/> where φ0 represents the angular separation between the respective<lb/> bright source and unmodelled source, and n is an integer number.<lb/> Usually the strongest ghost responses are the n = 0 and n = 1<lb/> positions, i.e. the suppression ghosts that sit on top of the sources<lb/> in question. However the case discovered in this work, and also two<lb/> independent cases (<ref type="biblio">de Bruyn, priv. comm., Clarke, priv. comm.</ref>) in<lb/> LOFAR data suggest that the n = −1 position could also generate<lb/> a strong response. What is significant about the transient presented<lb/> in this work, however, is that the ghost appears as a positive source.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.1.2 Investigating the NCP ghost<lb/></head>

			<p>Returning to the situation detailed in this paper, we were presented<lb/> with two sources for which either could be the real (transient)<lb/> source or the ghost. We attempted to simulate the situation within<lb/> real data, in order to investigate how the different stages of calibra-<lb/>tion would react to a bright transient, and if we could also generate<lb/> a positive ghost source. This was done by taking a different NCP<lb/> observation and inserting a simulated transient source into the<lb/> visibilities (the transient was set to be &apos;on&apos; for the entire 11 mins)<lb/> before any calibration had taken place. The snapshot was then<lb/> calibrated as normal, but importantly the inserted source was not<lb/> included in the NCP sky model used for the phase-only calibration<lb/> step (refer to Section 2.2). This test was repeated using various<lb/> different sky positions and flux densities for the inserted source.<lb/> We found that we could produce a significant positive ghost source<lb/> only if the flux of the simulated transient was relatively bright,<lb/> ∼40 Jy. An example can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>. We observed that it<lb/> was common for the total flux to be shared approximately equally<lb/> between the simulated source and its associated ghost. However,<lb/></p>

			<figure>0h<lb/> 1h<lb/> 2h<lb/> 3h<lb/> Right Ascension (J2000)<lb/> +81°<lb/> +82°<lb/> +83°<lb/> +84°<lb/> Declination (J2000)<lb/> 3C 61.1<lb/> ST<lb/> G<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> 3<lb/> 4<lb/> 5<lb/> 6<lb/> 7<lb/> 8<lb/> 9<lb/> 10<lb/> Figure 10. The resultant image after a simulated transient source (labelled<lb/> &apos;ST&apos;) was inserted into the visibilities of a NCP observation and processed<lb/> without the simulated source in the sky model. A ghost source (labelled<lb/> &apos;G&apos;) appears mirrored across 3C 61.1. The effect is not limited to one spe-<lb/>cific insertion point of the simulated transient and is more pronounced the<lb/> brighter the simulated transient. In this example, a source of brightness 80<lb/> Jy was inserted, which produces a very significant ghost source. The simu-<lb/>lated transient and ghost source each had a measured flux density of ∼25 Jy,<lb/> with the remaining ∼30 Jy being absorbed by 3C 61.1. This transfer of flux<lb/> was common when the simulated transient was brighter than 3C 61.1 (∼80<lb/> Jy). When lower, the flux is shared equally between the simulated and ghost<lb/> sources, with minimal flux transferred to 3C 61.1. The colour bar units are<lb/> Jy beam −1 .<lb/> </figure>

			<p>not every position on the sky at which the transient was inserted<lb/> produced a ghost source, a feature that we cannot currently<lb/> explain. Yet, when a transient was inserted at the position of ILT<lb/> J225347+862146, this did produce a ghost source. We were then<lb/> able to test what happened when the simulated source was included<lb/> in the sky model. We observed that when the simulated source<lb/> was accounted for perfectly in the sky model, the ghost source<lb/> disappeared. If the sky model component was instead inserted at<lb/> the location of the ghost source, while the ghost appeared brighter,<lb/> the simulated transient never fully disappeared.<lb/></p>

			<p>In light of the results from the simulations, we performed<lb/> the same sky model test with the transient candidate and ghost in<lb/> order to determine which source was the &apos;real&apos; source. Recalling<lb/> that the total flux of the transient candidate and ghost was ∼7 Jy<lb/> + ∼13 Jy ≈ 20 Jy, we began by inserting a 20 Jy point source<lb/> into the NCP sky model at the position of the transient candidate<lb/> and re-calibrated the dataset. We found that in this case the flux<lb/> of the ghost was significantly reduced, by ∼70 per cent, and the<lb/> candidate brightened by ∼100 per cent. Alternatively, if the model<lb/> component was entered at the ghost location, the candidate source<lb/> and ghost respective fluxes were only ∼10 per cent different from<lb/> their initial fluxes on discovery, i.e. when they were not in the sky<lb/> model at all. In fact increasing the sky model component to 25<lb/> Jy and placing it back at the position of the transient candidate<lb/> reduced the ghost such that it was no longer distinguishable from<lb/> the noise, as seen in the bottom panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. Hence, the<lb/> &apos;real&apos; source was determined to be at the position TRAP had origi-<lb/>nally reported, 22 h 53 m 47.1 s +86 ◦ 21 46.4 , to the west of 3C 61.1.<lb/></p>

			<p>The above tests have concentrated on the target NCP field sky<lb/> model, but we also have the sky model which was used to cali-<lb/>brate the calibrator observation. For this observation, the calibrator<lb/> source was 3C 295. Considering that ghosts occur because of sky<lb/> model errors, one could envision a scenario in which the error being<lb/> transferred from the calibrator to the target field results in the ghost<lb/> pattern observed. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the calibrator sky<lb/> models only contain the calibrator source itself and not any sur-<lb/>rounding field sources. While this generally allows the derivation<lb/> of sufficiently accurate gain solutions, the missing flux could be at-<lb/>tributed to a ghost pattern, which is then transferred to the target<lb/> field (see also <ref type="biblio">Asad et al. 2015</ref> for a similar discussion regarding<lb/> the 3C 196 field).<lb/></p>

			<p>To investigate this, two tests were performed. Firstly, the<lb/> phase-only calibration step was ignored and we imaged the dataset<lb/> using the amplitude and phase gain solutions directly from the<lb/> calibrator. In this case, both the transient and the ghost were<lb/> present, with no major changes from before (a result which makes<lb/> &apos;spurious symmetrisation&apos;, previously discussed in Section 5.1.1,<lb/> unlikely to be the sole cause of the ghost). Secondly, the calibrator<lb/> observation was not used at all and instead the data were calibrated<lb/> in both amplitude and phase using the constructed NCP target sky<lb/> model (described in Section 2.2) which importantly did not contain<lb/> the transient source. For this test, we increased the solution interval<lb/> to one minute (originally 10 s) to gain more signal-to-noise for the<lb/> calculations. We also had to perform post-processing clipping to<lb/> the visibilities to eliminate bad amplitude spikes in the calibrated<lb/> visibilities. In the full 11 min image, while the rms rose to ∼800<lb/> mJy beam −1 , a source was detected within one arcmin (the<lb/> resolution of the image was 5.6 × 2.4 arcmin) of the reported<lb/> transient candidate position with a flux density of 13 Jy. The ghost<lb/> source was not detected to a 5σ limit of 10 Jy at its expected<lb/> location, nor was it visible when the map was manually inspected.<lb/> However, due to the increase of the rms in this case, we cannot<lb/> state with complete confidence that the ghost source is not present<lb/> at all. Nonetheless, observing the transient source without placing<lb/> it in the sky model provided additional evidence that we had<lb/> identified the correct source.<lb/></p>

			<p>The above result tentatively points to the calibrator having an<lb/> important role in the ghost creation. However, understanding the<lb/> exact ghost mechanism is a complex task in the LOFAR case, and<lb/> each stage of the calibration must be taken into careful consid-<lb/>eration. For example, G14 has exclusively investigated situations<lb/> where full amplitude and phase calibration is used, so the effects of<lb/> a phase-only calibration is generally unknown at this stage. At the<lb/> time of writing, we cannot explain how the ghost is generated; a de-<lb/>tailed investigation is under way (<ref type="biblio">Grobler et al. in prep.</ref>) to resolve<lb/> the matter.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2 Transient flux density<lb/> </head>

			<head>5.2.1 Obtaining the correct flux<lb/></head>

			<p>The correct flux density of the transient proved difficult to ascer-<lb/>tain. We attempted to obtain an estimate by entering flux values<lb/> of the transient source manually into the calibration sky model,<lb/> over a range of 7.5–45 Jy, in steps of 2.5 Jy, and proceeded to re-<lb/>calibrate the visibilities (as previously described, this calibration<lb/> step is phase only). We then observed the influence this had on<lb/> the measured flux density of the transient itself, as well as the<lb/> measured flux densities of the surrounding sources, including the<lb/> ghost source. We remind the reader that the transient candidate, the<lb/> source deemed &apos;real&apos;, is to the west of 3C 61.1 and the ghost is the<lb/> source to the east of 3C 61.1. The transient was always placed as a<lb/> point source in the sky model. The results of this experiment can<lb/> be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref>. We found that the ghost source became in-<lb/>creasingly fainter as the transient flux was increased, right up until<lb/> the transient was entered as 20 Jy and the ghost could no longer<lb/> be distinguished from the background. The transient &apos;light curve&apos;<lb/> itself follows the trend of the increasing sky model flux, but it also<lb/> exhibits a sudden local maximum when the sky model entry level is<lb/> changed from 22.5 to 25 Jy. In this instance the extracted flux rises<lb/> from 16 Jy to 20 Jy. It then proceeds to fall back to an extracted<lb/> flux level of 18 Jy and continues to rise as before.<lb/></p>

			<p>As for the other nearby sources, while they are stable prior<lb/> to the sky model transient component reaching 17.5 Jy, beyond<lb/> this level they suffer a very noticeable decline that continues as<lb/> the transient flux is increased. It is also apparent that the other<lb/> sources in the field are affected by the before mentioned sudden<lb/> local maximum of the transient light curve around a sky model<lb/> flux of 25 Jy, with 3C 61.1 also showing a significant flux increase<lb/> (∼ 3σ to the scaled value). However, for VLSS 0110.7+8738<lb/> and VLSS 2130.1+8357, which are at a similar flux level to ILT<lb/> J225347+862146, there is a hint of a decrease, although within the<lb/> error bars of the flux measurements. In each case, once the sky<lb/> model flux is increased to the next step, the measured fluxes return<lb/> to their previous levels. When comparing the fluxes of the field<lb/> sources with the corresponding averages from the four surround-<lb/>ing snapshots, we see that they mostly agree within all the error<lb/> bars involved. The largest discrepancy comes from 3C 61.1, which<lb/> appears ∼ 10 per cent dimmer in the transient snapshot, which is<lb/> outside the errors of the average measurement. However, the sud-<lb/>den increase around 25 Jy causes 3C 61.1 to match the surrounding<lb/> average. This could be seen as a clue that this area represents the<lb/> real flux of the transient; at this point, with 25 Jy in the sky model,<lb/> the transient appears as 20 Jy in the image. Hence, with this in-<lb/>formation, we associate the true flux of the source with the point at<lb/> which the ghost disappears and the other sources in the field are not<lb/> heavily affected, which constrains our estimate of the flux density<lb/> of ILT J225347+862146 to be in the range 15–25 Jy.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.2 Testing known sources<lb/></head>

			<p>The test detailed above was performed directly on the two<lb/> field sources that were monitored during the investigation, VLSS<lb/> 0110.7+8738 and VLSS 2130.1+8357, with 60-MHz flux densi-<lb/>ties of ∼9 and ∼15 Jy respectively. This also included removing<lb/> the sources from the calibration sky model as well as changing<lb/> the input flux. Each source was treated as a separate case mean-<lb/>ing that both were never subtracted from the sky model, or edited,<lb/> at the same time. As before, these tests were performed at the tran-<lb/>sient epoch, but also in the two neighbouring epochs to ensure that<lb/> any effects were not just local to the transient-containing snapshot.<lb/> Without the source in the model, the measured flux was reduced<lb/> by ∼20 per cent, with the majority of the extra flux in the field be-<lb/>ing absorbed by 3C 61.1, which appeared slightly brighter. Once<lb/> the source was reinserted into the sky model, even at a low flux,<lb/> the source in question returned to the expected level. However, as<lb/> the sky model input flux was increased, so did the extracted flux,<lb/> which is consistent with how the transient acted previously. There<lb/></p>

The plot<lb/> also shows the extracted fluxes of four other sources in the field in order to<lb/> monitor any effects to other sources, along with the solid lines which show<lb/> the average flux of these field sources from the four surrounding snapshots.<lb/> The error on these averages is shown by the error bar at the beginning and<lb/> end of the line. Above an input flux value of 20 Jy (extracted transient flux<lb/> value of 17 Jy) it becomes apparent that the other sources are beginning to<lb/> be affected. They drop sharply beyond an entered flux of 30 Jy by which<lb/> point the ghost source is no longer statistically significant. Note that 3C<lb/> 61.1 has been scaled by subtracting 40 Jy from its flux measurements.<lb/></figure>

			<p>was also no distinguishing feature that would enable a confident<lb/> definition of these sources&apos; &apos;correct flux&apos; without prior knowledge.<lb/> Thus, it is not a surprise that the transient flux in Section 5.2.1 is<lb/> hard to identify purely from the behaviour of the source itself dur-<lb/>ing calibration when altering the sky model. Ideally self-calibration<lb/> would be used, but at the time of processing self-calibration with<lb/> LOFAR was still a relatively untested technique.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.2.3 Splitting the dataset in time<lb/></head>

			<p>In the test detailed above, where the transient was inserted into the<lb/> sky model with various different flux values, it was noticeable that<lb/> the flux that was inserted was never the flux that was measured. If<lb/> the transient was not &apos;on&apos; for the entire 11 min, this could perhaps<lb/> explain why this was the case. With the transient included in the<lb/> sky model at a flux of 20 Jy, the observation was firstly split in half<lb/> and imaged; however, the flux was consistent within the 1σ error<lb/> bars between each half. To probe deeper, we then referred to the 2-<lb/>minute images produced as part of the transient search, which did<lb/> not have the transient included in the sky model. This particular<lb/> observation, however, was above the average noise level (1.8 Jy<lb/> beam −1 ) with an rms of ∼2 Jy beam −1 . Neither the transient nor<lb/> ghost source had significant detections (with the significance level<lb/> now reduced to 5σ in order to try and detect the transient), and<lb/> even surrounding field sources were hard to distinguish because of<lb/> the poorer image quality.<lb/></p>

			<p>In an attempt to improve the situation, using our assumption<lb/> that the transient should be included in the sky model for the ob-<lb/></p>

			<figure>04:31<lb/> 04:33<lb/> 04:35<lb/> 04:37<lb/> 04:39<lb/> 04:41<lb/> 04:43<lb/> UTC<lb/> 0<lb/> 5<lb/> 10<lb/> 15<lb/> 20<lb/> 25<lb/> 30<lb/> Transient Flux (Jy)<lb/> 10 Jy In Sky Model<lb/> 20 Jy In Sky Model<lb/> Figure 12.

Data points represented by a square sig-<lb/>nify that the source was extracted from the image with a blind detection. In<lb/> contrast, the triangles represent flux values obtained from a forced fit at the<lb/> source position, where the source was no longer above the source extraction<lb/> threshold (13 Jy, 5σ). The two light curves follow the same trend, suggest-<lb/>ing that the transient is brighter than a 3σ limit of 7.5 Jy in the 4-minute<lb/> period of 04:34 -04:38. The 10-Jy input case, returning a measured flux<lb/> of 16 Jy, also suggests that 16 Jy may be the correct flux during this time<lb/> frame. These light curves were obtained by extending the phase-calibration<lb/> time interval to one min. The date of the observation was 2011 December<lb/> 24.<lb/> </figure>

			<p>servation, we phase-calibrated this dataset again using a larger so-<lb/>lution interval of 1-minute (previously 10 s), to allow more signal<lb/> to noise for the calculations. Using a source extraction threshold of<lb/> 5σ, TRAP was able to find the transient source in the second and<lb/> third of the 5, 2-minute images: the flux densities are 20.9 (8σ) and<lb/> 18.7 (7σ) Jy, respectively. The light curve can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<p>We were concerned about forcing the flux of the transient to<lb/> a specific value by simply entering that value into the sky model,<lb/> especially as in this case the fluxes returned were approximately<lb/> equal to the flux which was entered (20 Jy). Thus, we repeated this<lb/> test, but this time entering a 10-Jy transient at the position. In the<lb/> 10-Jy case the transient was detected in the second image only at<lb/> a lower flux density. The forced fit performed by the TRAP in the<lb/> third image yields a flux measurement of 13 Jy (just below 5σ),<lb/> before dropping off, which mimics the characteristics of the 20 Jy<lb/> sky model case.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first 2-minute image from each test was of noticeably<lb/> poorer quality than the other four, 2-minute images of the obser-<lb/>vation. As seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, the forced extraction at the transient<lb/> location in the first image returns the same flux density value (10<lb/> Jy) in each sky model test case. This value hints at the transient be-<lb/>ing present in this epoch as this flux level is higher than the fourth<lb/> and fifth epochs, where the transient is no longer detected in both<lb/> cases. However, due to the uncertainty in this image and the larger<lb/> error bars associated with this measurement, we cannot state for<lb/> certain that this is the case.<lb/></p>

			<p>We attempted to split the dataset which had been calibrated di-<lb/>rectly from the NCP field sky model, as discussed in Section 5.1.2,<lb/> but the calibration was not of sufficient quality to achieve useful<lb/> results.<lb/></p>

			<p>The results here therefore suggest that the transient was bright-<lb/>est between the second and sixth minute of the observation, a pe-<lb/>riod of four minutes. However, we are unable to fully characterise<lb/> the decay, or especially the rise time of the event, and hence we<lb/> cannot rule out the transient being active over a longer, 10-minute<lb/> time-scale.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3 Testing if a source can be created by the sky model<lb/></head>

			<p>Because the transient did not correspond to any source contained<lb/> in the sky model, a major concern was the possibility of &apos;creating&apos;<lb/> false sources in the field by purely inserting them into the sky<lb/> model. This could explain the apparent responsiveness of the<lb/> candidate to an entry in the sky model, and perhaps a source placed<lb/> anywhere in the field would have the same effect, both in creating<lb/> a source and causing the ghost source to disappear. We tested this<lb/> in two ways. Firstly, the snapshot containing the candidate was<lb/> reprocessed with the candidate component of the sky model moved<lb/> to an empty, unrelated location on the sky. This resulted in no<lb/> source being &apos;created&apos; at this location and also left the candidate,<lb/> and ghost, unaffected from their original detection states.<lb/></p>

			<p>The second test was to process the two preceding and two<lb/> subsequent snapshots with the candidate component inserted into<lb/> the sky model at its correct location. Previously, no detection was<lb/> made of the candidate in any other snapshot, and as the data were<lb/> recorded in sequence, the uv coverage of these observations were<lb/> all very similar. The result was that, once more, no source was<lb/> present at the candidate location, even when placed in the sky<lb/> model; this can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>, which shows the detection of<lb/> the candidate along with the snapshots before and after in time.<lb/></p> 

			<p>These two results meant that simply entering sources into the<lb/> sky model at an arbitrary position would not &apos;create&apos; an artificial<lb/> source. In contrast, the responsiveness of the transient candidate<lb/> to such input at the correct position suggested it was a real source<lb/> present in the data.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.4 Further validity testing<lb/></head>

			<p>A final set of tests and checks were performed to investigate<lb/> whether ILT J225347+862146 was an unexpected artefact. With<lb/> LOFAR being commissioned at the time, an artefact would not be<lb/> completely surprising. While the telescope was in a good working<lb/> state, a lack of optimisation of aspects such as station calibration<lb/> and beam models could cause issues. A series of tests were devised<lb/> to rule out certain possible artefact causes, all performed with the<lb/> source both in and out of the sky model when processing. These<lb/> tests were:<lb/> </p>

			<item>• Broadband RFI -Care was taken to manually reduce the<lb/> data, removing anything left over that was suspected of being<lb/> RFI, as well as running another pass of AOFLAGGER on the<lb/> data after calibration. Neither method affected the transient<lb/> source.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Narrow-band RFI -To rule out the possibility of narrow-<lb/>band RFI, the already limited bandwidth was split into two<lb/> and processed separately. The transient source remained in<lb/> each half of the bandwidth, with a flux consistent within the<lb/> 1σ error bars between the two halves.<lb/></item>

			<item>nothing peculiar and was of good quality. The calibrator for<lb/> this observation was 3C 295.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Calibrator Gains Only - Previously discussed in Sec-<lb/> tion 5.1.2, this test meant the phase-only calibration step<lb/> using the target field sky model was skipped; instead we<lb/> imaged the dataset with the gain amplitude and phase<lb/> solutions obtained directly from the calibrator being applied.<lb/> ILT J225347+862146 was still present in the resulting image<lb/> along with the ghost.<lb/> </item>

			<item>• Phase Centre Shift -The phase centre of the observation<lb/> was shifted to that of the transient (a shift of ∼4 deg). The<lb/> transient was still clearly visible with the shift, especially<lb/> when the source was included in the sky model.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Equal Local Sidereal Time Observations -Sixteen obser-<lb/>vations were found to have very similar local sidereal times<lb/> (LST) to that of the detection measurement, so these were<lb/> used to check whether the candidate was potentially caused<lb/> by that particular projection of the baselines on the sky. There<lb/> was no detection in any of these observations, which covered<lb/> four months of recording.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Bad Station Removal -Along with the automatic tool that<lb/> was part of the initial four tests, a manual inspection of the<lb/> data was also carried out, which was in agreement with the<lb/> results from the tool: the same two stations were perceived<lb/> as bad. After these stations were flagged, the image was<lb/> generally cleaner from artefacts with the transient source<lb/> unaffected.<lb/></item>

			<item>• Random Subset of Stations -Half of the 33 stations used in<lb/> the observation were randomly removed, after calibration,<lb/> with the remaining data being re-imaged.

An image using<lb/> a maximum projected baseline length of 15 km was also<lb/> produced in which the source was still present.

In this case, the candidate source was marginally<lb/> brighter than the ghost: the flux densities were 5.3 and 4.5<lb/> Jy respectively.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.5 What is this transient?<lb/></head>

			<p>With the candidate successfully passing the numerous exhaustive<lb/> tests detailed previously, we concluded that the candidate was a real<lb/> astrophysical source. Hence we proceeded to investigate its possi-<lb/>ble origin.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.5.1 Catalogue search and multi-wavelength follow-up<lb/></head>

			<p>No source was found within a 2-arcmin radius of the transient po-<lb/>sition in historical radio catalogues, including VLSS, WENSS and<lb/> NVSS. Also, no potential counterpart or related object was found<lb/> in high-energy catalogues, and no published gamma-ray burst or<lb/> supernova event is known at the position.<lb/> We carried out optical follow-up of the field by using the Liv-<lb/>erpool Telescope (LT; <ref type="biblio">Steele et al. 2004</ref>), though it is worth noting<lb/> that the transient was discovered two years after the event date.<lb/> Therefore, while a direct counterpart would not be observed, an<lb/> object of a certain type may be identified in the vicinity of the tran-<lb/>sient, and could be potentially associated with the radio emission.<lb/></p>

			<table>Table 3. Details of the follow-up observations performed with the Liverpool<lb/> Telescope.<lb/> Obs. Date<lb/> # Epochs Epoch Exposure Time<lb/> (s)<lb/> 2013/11/28<lb/> 3<lb/> 100<lb/> 2013/12/21<lb/> 3<lb/> 100<lb/> 2013/12/30<lb/> 3<lb/> 100<lb/> 2014/01/12<lb/> 2<lb/> 300<lb/></table> 

			<p>These observations with the LT used the r band filter on four dif-<lb/>ferent dates, which are shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>, totalling 11 epochs and<lb/> 1500 seconds of exposure time.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The combined image, shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>, was calibrated<lb/> against USNO-B1 (<ref type="biblio">Monet et al. 2003</ref>) and reaches r ∼ 22–<lb/> 22.5 mag. To search for a possible optical counterpart to ILT<lb/> J225347+862146, we established an error on the positional mea-<lb/>surement of the transient from the LOFAR data. This was cal-<lb/>culated by accounting for the following uncertainties which con-<lb/>tribute to the overall error: the error of the source extraction per-<lb/>formed by the TRAP which was reported as 11 arcsec and is mea-<lb/>sured following the error analysis of <ref type="biblio">Condon (1997)</ref>; the average<lb/> scatter of the extracted positions of bright sources in the dataset<lb/> by TRAP, measured to be 7 arcsec; and finally the reported 5 arcsec<lb/> positional error of the VLSS catalogue, which the phase calibration<lb/> sky model is based upon. Summing these values in quadrature we<lb/> gain the final positional error of 14 arcsec.<lb/></p>

			<p>Using this value, we unambiguously detect four sources<lb/> within a 2σ error circle centred at the transient position, one of<lb/> which is fully enclosed by the 1σ uncertainty as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig-<lb/>ure 14</ref>. None of these sources displayed either strong short-term<lb/> (minutes) or long-term (weeks) variability. We used the USNO-B1<lb/> catalogue to look for high-proper-motion stars in the field, with the<lb/> assumption that these would be nearby objects. Two of the four<lb/> sources mentioned previously within the 2σ radius, had associated<lb/> proper motions of higher than 100 mas year −1 and are marked in<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref>. However, neither of these sources exhibited a colour<lb/> consistent with being an M-dwarf or any other possible transient<lb/> object (but we note that the error associated to the USNO-B1 cat-<lb/>alogue colours is significant). In addition, both sources were de-<lb/>tected in our LT images and no associated variability was observed.<lb/> We also consulted the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE;<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Wright et al. 2010</ref>) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS;<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Skrutskie et al. 2006</ref>); a total of three and two sources were located<lb/> within the 2σ error circle in each survey, respectively. In each case,<lb/> two objects were the previously reported high-proper-motion stars;<lb/> however neither of these, or the one other source in WISE, were<lb/> found to be variable.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Given possible further uncertainties of the accuracy of the<lb/> measured position in the LOFAR band, we extended the error circle<lb/> to a radius of one arcmin from the transient position. A total of 20<lb/> sources were within this larger error circle in our LT observations;<lb/> however, as previously, there was no strong evidence of a possible<lb/> association with ILT J225347+862146.<lb/></p>

			<p>We conclude that there is no obvious counterpart candidate.<lb/> We now consider whether the radio emission could arise from ei-<lb/>ther an incoherent or coherent process.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.5.2 Incoherent origin<lb/></head>

			<p>If we consider the incoherent emission process, we can place a limit<lb/> on the maximum distance of the source, by using the known char-<lb/>acteristics of the transient along with assuming that its brightness<lb/> temperature (TB) is at the maximum TB = 10 12 K limit, TBmax, for<lb/> (un-beamed) synchrotron radiation (<ref type="biblio">Kellermann &amp; Pauliny-Toth<lb/> 1969</ref>). To do this we make use of the Rayleigh-Jeans law, that is<lb/></p>

				<formula>TBmax =<lb/> ∆Lν<lb/> 8πkν 2 ∆t 2 ,<lb/> (4)<lb/></formula>

			<p>where ∆Lν is the change of the luminosity in time-scale ∆t, k<lb/> is the Boltzmann constant and ν is the observing frequency. The<lb/> luminosity at frequency ν is defined as Lν = 4πd 2 S, where d<lb/> is the distance and S is flux density. Using this and re-arranging<lb/> Equation 4 we obtain an expression for the distance as follows:<lb/></p>

				<formula>d 2 =<lb/> 2kν 2 ∆t 2 TBmax<lb/> ∆S<lb/> .<lb/> (5)<lb/></formula>

			<p>For the flux density change ∆S = 20 Jy in time ∆t = 10 min, we<lb/> obtain a maximum distance of 13.7 pc. This points to the possibility<lb/> of the transient being a nearby flare star.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the case where the source is relativistic, with the<lb/> synchrotron radiation now beamed, the observed brightness<lb/> temperature could exceed 10 12 K. This is seen in populations such<lb/> as AGN (<ref type="biblio">Horiuchi et al. 2004; Kovalev et al. 2005</ref>) and GRBs<lb/> (<ref type="biblio">Kulkarni et al. 1999; Anderson et al. 2014</ref>). From Equation 5 it<lb/> can be seen that d ∝ T<lb/> 1<lb/> 2 . For example, if a brightness temperature<lb/> such as 10 16 K was observed, a value at which these sources<lb/> can sometimes appear (<ref type="biblio">Pietka et al. 2015</ref>), this would place the<lb/> distance estimate of the transient at 1.4 kpc, an unrealistic distance<lb/> for such classes of objects.<lb/></p>

			<p>Various previous studies have investigated the radio transient<lb/> properties of flare stars at both centimetre and decametre wave-<lb/>lenghts (<ref type="biblio">Lovell 1969; Gudel et al. 1989; Bastian 1990; Jackson<lb/> et al. 1990; Abdul-Aziz et al. 1995; Osten et al. 2006</ref>). A recent<lb/> study, <ref type="biblio">Boiko et al. (2012)</ref>, involved monitoring the flare stars AD<lb/> Leonis (d = 4.9 pc) and EV Lacertae (d = 5.1 pc) with the UTR-2<lb/> telescope, located in Ukraine, during March 2010 and 2011. These<lb/> observations, performed in the frequency range of 16.5–33 MHz,<lb/> yielded a total of 167 and 73 detected radio bursts from the respec-<lb/>tive stars. In the case of AD Leonis, the average flux of the bursts<lb/> was in the range of 10–50 Jy, seemingly consistent with the flux<lb/> measured from ILT J225347+862146 at 60 MHz. However, one<lb/> discrepancy is that the average duration of these bursts seen from<lb/> AD Leonis, which is 2–12 seconds, is considerably shorter than the<lb/> apparent ∼minutes of activity observed for ILT J225347+862146.<lb/> In addition, the sole detection of the transient is possibly suspi-<lb/>cious in this context. One would expect the detection of subse-<lb/>quent transient events from an active flare star over a period of four<lb/> months (the time-scale of this transient search). Recent results such<lb/> as <ref type="biblio">Notsu et al. (2013)</ref>, which show Kepler solar type stars exhibit-<lb/>ing super-flares, could offer an explanation, with some flare events<lb/> being active for ∼10 min time-scales (<ref type="biblio">Schaefer et al. 2000</ref>). The<lb/> flare star hypothesis could be tested further by directing future ob-<lb/>servations towards the Galactic plane rather than the NCP, as the<lb/> density of flare stars should be dramatically increased.<lb/></p>

			<p>If a flare star origin is assumed for ILT J225347+862146,<lb/> along with the object not not being detected in our follow-up opti-<lb/>cal image to a depth of r ∼ 22 mag, we can use this information<lb/> to make a crude estimate of the distance of such an object such that<lb/> it is consistent with a non-detection. For this, we consult a cata-<lb/>logue of 463 UV Cet-type flare stars compiled by <ref type="biblio">Gershberg et al.<lb/> (1999)</ref>, selecting those which have a measured R band magnitude.<lb/> The stars in the catalogue have a maximum distance of 50 pc, and<lb/> we also only consider M type stars. These selected stars are then<lb/> divided into two sub-type groups: early type stars (M0-4) and late<lb/> type stars (M5-9). In total these groups have 69 and 20 stars re-<lb/>spectively. We then calculated the average absolute magnitudes of<lb/> these two groups, and subsequently at what average distance the<lb/> population would be if the apparent magnitude became 22 mag.<lb/> We found these distances to be ∼ 2 kpc for the early type stars and<lb/> ∼ 0.3 kpc for the late type stars (consistent with estimated Galac-<lb/>tic scale height values defined by <ref type="biblio">Holwerda et al. 2014</ref>). Hence,<lb/> the object responsible for ILT J225347+862146 could be further<lb/> than these distances, dependent on spectral sub-type, if it is not de-<lb/>tected in our deep optical image obtained with the LT. However,<lb/> at these distances, this would make the radio event extremely lu-<lb/>minous, which is unlikely. Therefore, it would become likely that<lb/> ILT J225347+862146 is a nearby sub-stellar object. These values<lb/> could be further constrained by a deeper analysis of stellar objects,<lb/> so this conclusion is made tentatively. It is also worth noting that,<lb/> although we were unable to pick out a possible responsible object,<lb/> it is entirely possible that the source is present in the deep optical<lb/> image.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.5.3 Coherent origin<lb/></head>

			<p>A new class of radio transient has emerged in recent years,<lb/> known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). These events are single,<lb/> bright (∼ Jy), bursts, which typically last for a few milliseconds<lb/> and have never been seen to repeat. These bursts also exhibit<lb/> high DM indicating that the population is extragalactic in origin.<lb/> The first such event was seen by <ref type="biblio">Lorimer et al. (2007)</ref> with the<lb/> Parkes Observatory in Australia. Since this discovery, a further<lb/> eight bursts have been detected using Parkes (<ref type="biblio">Keane et al. 2011;<lb/> Thornton et al. 2013; Burke-Spolaor &amp; Bannister 2014; Ravi et al.<lb/> 2015; Petroff et al. 2015</ref>) plus one event detected with the Arecibo<lb/> Observatory (<ref type="biblio">Spitler et al. 2014</ref>). The implied rate of FRBs based<lb/> on these events has been predicted to be up to possibly thousands<lb/> of FRBs occurring every day over the entire sky (<ref type="biblio">Hassall et al.<lb/> 2013; Lorimer et al. 2013</ref>). The progenitors of all these events are<lb/> unknown, leading to a wide range of proposed theories regarding<lb/> how FRBs are produced (see <ref type="biblio">Totani 2013; Kashiyama et al. 2013;<lb/> Falcke &amp; Rezzolla 2014; Zhang 2014; Loeb et al. 2014; Kulkarni<lb/> et al. 2014; Mottez &amp; Zarka 2014</ref>). Searches at low frequencies<lb/> have, thus far, not detected any FRBs, nor have any FRBs been<lb/> found using interferometric arrays which would enable a better<lb/> localisation of any discovered burst (<ref type="biblio">Coenen et al. 2014; Law et al.<lb/> 2015</ref>).<lb/></p> 

			<p><ref type="biblio">Hassall et al. (2013)</ref> showed that when the scattering of a<lb/> highly-dispersed burst is significant, imaging surveys for FRBs can<lb/> be competitive with pulsar-like, high-time-resolution surveys, if not<lb/> more sensitive, in detecting such events. To investigate this possi-<lb/>bility, we consider how the scattering time and fluence of the four<lb/> FRB events reported in <ref type="biblio">Thornton et al. (2013) at 1.3 GHz, compare<lb/></ref> to this event at 60 MHz. Firstly, to achieve estimates for the scat-<lb/>tering time of the Thornton events at 60 MHz, we use the standard<lb/> relation of<lb/></p> 

			<formula>τsc(ν) ∝ ν γ ,<lb/> (6)<lb/></formula> 

			<table>Table 4. The observed width of the four bursts reported in Thornton et al.<lb/> (2013) along with the estimated width of the event at 60 MHz. To calculate<lb/> the estimated width we use the relation τsc(ν) ∝ ν γ where γ = −4.<lb/> Dispersion effects are ignored and we assume a scenario of the reported<lb/> widths being dominated by scattering. Of the four reported bursts, FRB<lb/> 110220 was the sole event to show any evidence of scattering.<lb/> Event<lb/> Observed width<lb/> Estimated width<lb/> at 1.3 GHz (ms)<lb/> at 60 MHz (s)<lb/> FRB 110220<lb/> 5.6<lb/> 1234<lb/> FRB 110627<lb/> &lt; 1.4<lb/> &lt; 309<lb/> FRB 110703<lb/> &lt; 4.3<lb/> &lt; 948<lb/> FRB 120127<lb/> &lt; 1.1<lb/> &lt; 242<lb/></table>

			<p>where γ = −4. For the purposes of this scenario we ignore any<lb/> dispersion effects and assume that the recorded burst duration is<lb/> dominated by scattering. This assumption is quite reasonable when<lb/> considering the value of any dispersion induced smearing of the<lb/> signal, ∆tD, which can be calculated per MHz of bandwidth by<lb/></p>

			<formula>∆tD = 8.3 × 10 3 DM ν −3<lb/> MHz ,<lb/> (7)<lb/></formula>

			<p>where DM is the dispersion measure and νMHz is the observing fre-<lb/>quency in MHz. With a bandwidth of 183 kHz and an observing<lb/> frequency of 60 MHz, ∆tD = 7 × 10 −3 DM s. Thus, even with a<lb/> DM value of 1000 pc cm −3 , ∆tD would only cause 7 s of smearing.<lb/> <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> shows that the predicted, scatter-dominated width of the<lb/> events at 60 MHz range from 242–1234 s (taking the upper limit<lb/> values), with the highest value belonging to FRB 110220. We see<lb/> that the maximum duration of our transient, ILT J225347+862146,<lb/> of &lt; 660 s is quite consistent with that expected from an FRB at 60<lb/> MHz. In reality, only FRB 110220 showed any evidence of scatter-<lb/>ing.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Next we compare the fluence of the events. Taking a width<lb/> of 11 min for ILT J225347+862146 (6.6 × 10 5 ms), and the<lb/> flux as 20 Jy, the fluence of ILT J225347+862146 can be stated<lb/> as 20 × 6.6 × 10 5 = 1.3 × 10 7 Jy ms at 60 MHz. Taking the<lb/> shorter time-scale of four minutes (as discussed in Section 5.2.3)<lb/> at 20 Jy gives a fluence of 4.8 × 10 6 Jy ms. The event with the<lb/> highest fluence as reported in <ref type="biblio">Thornton et al. (2013)</ref> was FRB<lb/> 110220 with 8 Jy ms at 1.3 GHz. We can compare these fluence<lb/> values assuming different spectral indices. In the case of α = 0,<lb/> a direct comparison is possible, showing that the LOFAR event<lb/> has a vastly greater fluence than the known FRB. Assuming<lb/> α = −2 and extrapolating the peak flux of the LOFAR event<lb/> to 1.3 GHz, the fluence now becomes 2.81 × 10 4 Jy ms for the<lb/> 11 min scenario. This is still much greater than FRB 110220.<lb/> For the LOFAR event to be consistent with this particular burst,<lb/> which is by far the highest fluence of the four reported bursts<lb/> in <ref type="biblio">Thornton et al. (2013)</ref>, then a spectral index of α ∼ −4.7<lb/> would be required. This implies that the LOFAR event would<lb/> be an abnormally bright FRB, even more so than the bright<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Lorimer et al. (2007)</ref> burst at 30 Jy. The characteristic spectral<lb/> index of FRBs is currently not well defined, but a value of −4.7<lb/> would be very steep regardless of the population. Although the<lb/> time-scale of ILT J225347+862146 is consistent with a scattered<lb/> FRB at low-frequencies, the required steep spectral index along<lb/> with the inconsistency between the fluence of the known FRB<lb/> events, casts considerable doubt regarding an FRB origin. With<lb/> the exact characteristics of FRBs currently unknown, we can-<lb/>not state that ILT J225347+862146 belongs to the same population.<lb/></p>

			<p>It should be noted, as described by <ref type="biblio">Güdel (2002)</ref>, that coher-<lb/>ent emission from plasma processes can also occur in stellar objects<lb/> such as flare stars. Such emission has also been seen from the Sun<lb/> at low-frequencies; for example in type III solar radio bursts (<ref type="biblio">Bas-<lb/>tian et al. 1998</ref>). For this hypothesis, the arguments which were<lb/> presented in Section 5.5.2 concerning a flare star origin also apply<lb/> here. In particular, if this were the origin of ILT J225347+862146,<lb/> it appears unusual to not see the event repeat over a four month<lb/> period, yet we cannot rule out this possibility.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.5.4 Other populations<lb/></head>

			<p>Other populations such as AGN and X-ray binary systems were<lb/> considered. However, we have insufficient evidence to confirm or<lb/> rule out such classes as the origin of ILT J225347+862146.<lb/></p>

			<p>Over the past decade, a variety of new radio transient sources<lb/> have been attributed to different kinds of neutron stars. These<lb/> include populations such as Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs;<lb/> <ref type="biblio">McLaughlin et al. 2006</ref>) and intermittent pulsars (<ref type="biblio">Kramer et al.<lb/> 2006</ref>), with some intermittent pulsars seen to have periods in the<lb/> off-state of more than a year (<ref type="biblio">Camilo et al. 2012</ref>). It is possible<lb/> that the transient reported in this paper could be an atypical iso-<lb/>lated neutron star such as these described populations; however at<lb/> this time it is not possible to present any evidence to support this<lb/> hypothesis.<lb/></p>

			<head>6 TRANSIENT SURFACE DENSITY &amp; RATES<lb/></head>

			<p>No transients were found at four of the five time-scales searched,<lb/> with one detection in the other. This allows us to place upper limits<lb/> on the rate of low-frequency transient events on the whole sky at<lb/> these time-scales. To calculate the upper limits of the surface den-<lb/>sity of transients, Poisson statistics are used, specifically:<lb/> </p>

			<formula>P (n) = e −ρA<lb/> (8)<lb/></formula>

			<p>where ρ is the surface density of sources per square degree and A<lb/> represents the equivalent solid angle obtained by multiplying the<lb/> area of the sky surveyed, Ω, by the number of epochs N − 1. In<lb/> using this approach we are also assuming isotropic probability of a<lb/> transient detection, i.e. events are likely to be extragalactic in ori-<lb/>gin. We can define P (n) = 0.05 at the Poisson 2σ confidence level,<lb/> and by rearranging Equation 8 we can obtain the respective value<lb/> of ρ for each time-scale, recalling that the area of sky searched in<lb/> each case was 175 deg 2 . For no detections P (0) = 0.05 is used,<lb/> whereas for the 11-minute time-scale this becomes P (1) = 0.05<lb/> because of our single detection. These values can be found in Ta-<lb/>ble 5.<lb/></p> 

			<p>ILT J225347+862146 provides us with 1 +3.74<lb/> −0.95 transient events<lb/> detected in the 11-minute time-scale search, using upper and lower<lb/> limits at 95% confidence as defined by Gehrels (1986). As a 10σ<lb/> limit was used for the source extraction, the flux density limit of<lb/> this search was 7.9 Jy; moreover, 1897 11-minute epochs are equiv-<lb/>alent to 14.5 days of observations. This equates to a transient rate<lb/> of 3.9 +14.7<lb/> −3.7 × 10 −4 day −1 deg −2 .<lb/> </p>

			<p>However, it should be noted that the flux density limit of this<lb/> rate is defined with the assumption that sources are &apos;non-ghosted&apos;.<lb/> As seen in this work, transients with an associated ghost can be re-<lb/>duced in brightness when not accounted for in processing. While<lb/> we are yet to exactly constrain the magnitude of the effect, we can<lb/> make an estimate by taking ILT J225347+862146 as an example.<lb/> In this case the source was originally detected as 7.5 Jy with an<lb/> </p>

Therefore a minimum reduction in flux density of 50 per<lb/> cent is possible, meaning that the flux density limit of the quoted<lb/> rate would rise to 8 Jy for ghosted sources. For the purposes of<lb/> comparing rates, in the remainder of the paper we use the ideal,<lb/> non-ghosted flux density limit of 7.9 Jy.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.1 Comparison to other transient surveys<lb/></head>

			<p>We primarily consider how our results relate to other low-frequency<lb/> surveys ( 330 MHz). We also only compare against transient sur-<lb/>veys. <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref> shows the results in which we have included all the<lb/> surveys that are summarised in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. In general, the results are<lb/> consistent with the previous low-frequency surveys. We are able to<lb/> improve upon the sensitivity of the <ref type="biblio">Lazio et al. (2010)</ref> surface den-<lb/>sity by at least two orders of magnitude, with the data points from<lb/> this work providing some of the most extensive searches thus far at<lb/> low frequencies.<lb/></p> 

			<p>It is also possible to extrapolate our results to gigahertz fre-<lb/>quencies, for which extensive reviews of high-frequency surveys<lb/> have been compiled by <ref type="biblio">Fender &amp; Bell (2011), Ofek et al. (2011)<lb/> and Fender et al. (2015)</ref>. We find that our limits become competi-<lb/>tive with previous surveys for transient populations with a spectral<lb/> index of −1, and probe deeper than previous surveys if the spectral<lb/> index is steepened to −2.<lb/></p>

			<head>6.2 Comparison of time-dependent surface densities<lb/></head>

			<p>It is important to realise that when comparing the transient sur-<lb/>face density and flux densities of different surveys, the time-scale at<lb/> which the survey was performed is just as important. A survey only<lb/> looking at month-scale epochs will not be sensitive to minute or<lb/> sub-minute-scale transients. The converse is also true depending on<lb/> the survey length and sensitivity. Defining the sensitive time-scale<lb/> of a transient survey is a complex task, with the epoch time (i.e.<lb/> the time-scale of an individual epoch) and cadence of the epochs<lb/> usually incorporating a range of values. Generally, we assume that<lb/> the integration time of each observation is the time-scale of a tran-<lb/>sient on which the survey is most sensitive to. If the integration<lb/> time matches the duration of the transient event, then the signal-<lb/>to-noise will, in the majority of cases, be maximised. However as<lb/> surveys are designed differently, the integration time is not always<lb/> the equivalent &apos;epoch time&apos;. Some epochs are created by averaging<lb/> many different observations together for example, or other meth-<lb/></p>

The<lb/> viewing angle has been selected to primarily show the flux density and time-scale comparison. We do not consider variable source limits in this plot. The<lb/> 11-minute limit from this work, as well as the limits of Hyman et al. (2009), Jaeger et al. (2012) and Obenberger et al. (2014a), have been derived from the<lb/> detection of one or more transients. The others are limits placed with no detections. Right panel: The same plot as the left panel, but now the flux density<lb/> axis has been collapsed to clearly show the surface density and time-scale comparison.

			<p>ods such as creating mosaic fields. This can be especially true in<lb/> gigahertz surveys. However, the low-frequency searches presented<lb/> here as a comparison mostly do have an equal integration and epoch<lb/> time. This is likely due to the large FoV of some of the facilities,<lb/> minimising the need to use multiple observations to cover a large<lb/> fraction of the sky.<lb/></p>

			<p>The cadence of the observations can also be just as valid<lb/> as a defining characteristic. Taking this work as an example, the<lb/> NCP search is also sensitive to slow transients that could evolve<lb/> on time-scales of days, up to the maximum time between two<lb/> observations of four months. Thus, to avoid the complex visual that<lb/> would be required to represent all this information, we compare<lb/> the surveys based upon their respective epoch times (see <ref type="biblio">Carbone<lb/> et al. 2015</ref> for the alternate cadence comparison). The left panel of<lb/> <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref> shows the same plot as in <ref type="figure">Figure 15</ref>; however, a z-axis<lb/> of time-scales has now been included to display which areas of<lb/> the time-scale parameter space have been surveyed. The surveys<lb/> included are the same which have previously been used and are<lb/> summarised in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>. The right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 16</ref> presents<lb/> the same information but with the flux density axis collapsed, to<lb/> clearly show the surface density against time-scale comparison.<lb/></p>

			<p>What we see from this comparison is a clear definition of sur-<lb/>face densities at the time-scales of minutes to hours within a range<lb/> of sensitivities from the millijansky level to tens of jansky, which<lb/> does improve upon the <ref type="biblio">Lazio et al. (2010)</ref> surface density. It also<lb/> becomes apparent that there is a region of sensitivities – the jansky–<lb/> millijanksy regime – that is yet to be explored at all time-scales.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Jaeger et al. (2012)</ref> is currently the only survey to have probed to<lb/> a ∼ 1 mJy depth at low frequencies, and with a detected transient,<lb/> this perhaps hints at the potential of further discoveries at these<lb/> depths. Improving the sensitivity at shorter time-scales is also an<lb/> area that could prove fruitful in transient searches.<lb/></p>

			<head>7 CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>In this paper, we have presented the results of a search for transient<lb/> or variable sources at 60 MHz using the International LOFAR<lb/> Telescope. The search was centred at the North Celestial Pole,<lb/> covering 175 deg 2 of sky with a bandwidth of 195 kHz and con-<lb/>ducted over the period 2011 December–2012 April. The search for<lb/> transients and variables was performed using the automated, newly<lb/> developed, Transients Pipeline (TRAP). No transient or variable<lb/> sources were discovered at time-scales of 30 seconds, 2 minutes,<lb/> 55 minutes and 297 minutes. However, several candidates were<lb/> discovered at the 11-minute time-scale. After extensive testing to<lb/> check if these objects were due to calibration or imaging errors, one<lb/> of these candidates is considered to be a real astrophysical event,<lb/> based on the available data. The transient, ILT J225347+862146,<lb/> was seen only in one 11 minute epoch out of 1897, implying a<lb/> transient rate of 3.9 +14.7<lb/> −3.7 × 10 −4 day −1 deg −2 . While complicated<lb/> by the processing strategy, the flux density of the event is believed<lb/> to be in the range of 15–25 Jy and was most active for an estimated<lb/> time of four minutes. However, the rise or decay time-scale of the<lb/> event is not sufficiently well defined such that the full duration of<lb/> activity could extend to a 10-minute time-scale.<lb/></p>

			<p>At present, we are unable to determine the astrophysical origin<lb/> of ILT J225347+862146. There are no recorded objects at the tran-<lb/>sient position in previous radio or high-energy catalogues. Optical<lb/> follow-up observations were performed at the transient position,<lb/> with 20 objects detected within the 1-arcminute-radius error circle.<lb/> None of these optical sources showed any short or long-term vari-<lb/>ability and no immediately obvious counterpart was identified in<lb/> the field. However, the discovery of this transient two years after it<lb/> was active diminishes the effectiveness of follow-up observations,<lb/> highlighting the need for real-time transient searches and follow-<lb/>up.<lb/></p>

			<p>We considered the possibility of the transient being a flare star<lb/> event, due to the likely close proximity of the object. However,<lb/> the time-scale of the burst is an order of magnitude longer than<lb/> what would be expected from previous observations of flare stars<lb/> at low frequencies. We also considered whether the event could be<lb/> an FRB. While the duration of the event is consistent with a scat-<lb/>tered burst at 1.3 GHz extrapolated to 60 MHz, it was considered<lb/> unlikely due to the transient exhibiting a much larger fluence than<lb/> would be expected from previously seen FRBs, which would re-<lb/>quire a very steep spectral index (α &lt; −4.7) to be plausible.<lb/></p>

			<p>With LOFAR and other instruments now fully operational, the<lb/> low-frequency transient sky is being probed to depths that have<lb/> never previously been achieved. If the discovered transient pre-<lb/>sented in this paper is a member of a real population, then there<lb/> is no question that more will be found in future and current dedi-<lb/>cated transient surveys. This is especially true with ever improving<lb/> calibration techniques and more accurate sky models at these low<lb/> frequencies, combined with these surveys taking advantage of the<lb/> full capabilities of these new, current generation telescopes.<lb/></p>
