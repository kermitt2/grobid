			<p>Fine chemical industry is increasingly taking advantage<lb/> of biocatalysts to produce high-value products because<lb/> enzymes and whole-cell biocatalysts can be sometimes<lb/> more convenient than synthetic chemistry <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. Biotrans-<lb/>formations occur under mild conditions of temperature,<lb/> pressure and pH, and may display their activity with high<lb/> chemo-, regio-and stereoselectivity <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>. Thus, biocataly-<lb/>sis has developed from a niche technology to a widely<lb/> used manufacturing method, and the availability of new<lb/> biocatalytic processes for the preparation of optically pure<lb/> molecules is very attractive for organic chemists.<lb/></p>

			<p>Due to the increasing demand of optically pure building<lb/> blocks, considerable efforts are addressed at identifying,<lb/> characterizing, improving, and developing Old Yellow<lb/> Enzymes (OYE) biocatalysts, i.e. flavin-dependent eno-<lb/>ate reductases (EC 1.6.99.1), that catalyze the chemo-<lb/>and stereoselective hydrogenation of electron-poor al-<lb/>kenes <ref type="biblio">[3,4]</ref>. Their biotechnological potential lies on the<lb/> ability to generate up to two stereocenters by the stereo-<lb/>selective anti-hydrogenation of the activated C = C double<lb/> bond, which is highly demanded in asymmetric synthesis,<lb/> since conventional chemical methods mostly give syn-<lb/>hydrogenation <ref type="biblio">[5,6]</ref>. OYEs have been found in plants,<lb/> bacteria, and fungi <ref type="biblio">[7-10]</ref>, OYE1 from Saccharomyces<lb/> pastorianus being the first to be widely studied for<lb/> structure, substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[11-14]</ref>. In order to improve the tools for asymmetric<lb/> reductions of activated olefins, the biodiversity of non-<lb/>conventional yeasts was explored as well, and yielded<lb/> several novel OYE genes <ref type="biblio">[15,16]</ref>. OYE genes from un-<lb/>conventional yeasts were cloned and expressed in Sac-<lb/>charomyces cerevisiae which was used as a whole-cell<lb/> biocatalyst, demonstrating the important role of uncon-<lb/>ventional yeasts as sources of novel biocatalysts and<lb/> their potential for the expansion of known genetic bio-<lb/>diversity <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the present study, recombinant strains of S. cerevisiae<lb/> lacking endogenous OYE and expressing eight OYE genes<lb/> from as many unconventional yeasts were used as whole-<lb/>cell biocatalysts to reduce different substrates with an acti-<lb/>vated electron-poor double bond, in order to compare<lb/> their catalytic and selectivity properties. It was investigated<lb/> whether the electronic properties and the steric hindrance<lb/> affected reactivity and/or enzyme stereoselectivity in the<lb/> asymmetric reduction. The structure of three selected en-<lb/>zymes was predicted through comparative modeling and<lb/> the active sites compared. The reactivity of the tested<lb/> substrates, has been also studied by means of electronic<lb/> computations, such as the lowest unoccupied molecular<lb/> orbitals (LUMO) distribution and OYE-substrate inter-<lb/>actions were analyzed to reveal the key features of the<lb/> structure and the sequence patterns of these new eno-<lb/>ate reductases.<lb/></p>

			<head>Asymmetric reductions with recombinant strains of<lb/> S. cerevisiae expressing OYE genes.<lb/></head>

			<p>The strain S. cerevisiae BY4741ΔOye2, that lacks en-<lb/>dogenous Oye2 gene and presents negligible overall OYE<lb/> activity <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>, was used as the host to express the OYE<lb/> genes from S. cerevisiae BY4741 (OYE2), S. cerevisiae<lb/> L12, and from the unconventional yeasts Candida cas-<lb/>tellii DBVPG3704, Candida sake DBVPG6162, Kazach-<lb/>stania exigua L10, Kazachstania lodderae DBVPG6308,<lb/> Kazachstania spencerorum DBVPG6748, Nakaseomyces<lb/> bacillisporus DBVPG6945, and Naumovia castellii DBV<lb/> PG6298 <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. Recombinant strains bearing heterologous<lb/> OYE genes were used as whole-cells biocatalysts to reduce<lb/> three molecules with electron-poor double bond activated<lb/> by different electron-withdrawing groups (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), i.e.<lb/> ketoisophorone (2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-ene-1,4-dione,<lb/> 1a), α-methyl-trans-cinnamaldehyde ((E)-2-methyl-3-phenyl-<lb/>2-propenal, 2a), and trans-β-methyl-β-nitrostyrene ((E)-<lb/>1-phenyl-2-nitropropene, 3a).<lb/></p>

			<p>The activity towards 1a of the diverse recombinant<lb/> S. cerevisiae was evaluated using resting cells. The con-<lb/>version was at least 86% after 5 h and, for most of the<lb/> strains, was nearly complete after 24 h (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). How-<lb/>ever, even though high efficiency of 1a transformation<lb/> was observed, and the reaction proceeded with prefer-<lb/>ence for the R-levodione (1b), the enantioselectivity<lb/> generally decreased compared to that obtained with<lb/> the corresponding wild type yeasts <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The biotransformation of 2a by whole-cells of wild-<lb/>type Baker&apos;s yeast has been reported to result in a mix-<lb/>ture of saturated 2-methyl-3-phenylpropanol (2c) and<lb/> unsaturated primary alcohol 2-methyl-3-phenyl-2-prope-<lb/>nol (2d, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), with different ratios depending on the<lb/> strain and the experimental conditions <ref type="biblio">[17,18]</ref>. Consist-<lb/>ently, the transformation of 2a using the wild type S.<lb/> cerevisiae BY4741 gave a mixture of 2c (78%) and 2d<lb/> (22%). On the contrary, S. cerevisiae BY4741ΔOye2, that<lb/> lacks endogenous Oye2 gene, yielded 2d as the sole de-<lb/>tectable product, indicating the pivotal role of OYE2<lb/> protein in the enoate reductase activity of the parental<lb/> strain <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>. Reduction of 2a with most of the recombin-<lb/>ant strains gave 2c as the only observed product by<lb/> means of the subsequent C = C and carbonyl reductions<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The enhanced OYE activity of the recombin-<lb/>ant strains prevented the formation of 2d observed using<lb/> S. cerevisiae BY4741, with the exception of the strain ex-<lb/>pressing the C. castellii OYE gene that yielded a mixture<lb/> of 2c and 2d. Interestingly, enantioselectivity ranged be-<lb/>tween 59 and &gt; 98%, with four strains yielding (S)-2c as<lb/> the sole detectable enantiomer.<lb/></p>

			<p>The majority of recombinant strains exhibited a high<lb/> rate in reducing 3a to 1-phenyl-2-nitropropane (3b), but<lb/> low e.e. (29-58%) was generally observed (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/> Similar behavior was observed with different microbial<lb/> whole-cells, where the scarce enantioselectivity was<lb/> mostly due to the easy racemization of the saturated<lb/> nitro-derivative <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data herein reported proved that the OYE biocata-<lb/>lysts, based on recombinant S. cerevisiae BY4741ΔOye2<lb/> expressing OYE genes from non-conventional yeasts,<lb/> were able to efficiently convert not only the enone 1a, a<lb/> well-established OYE substrate, but present a broader<lb/> substrate specificities being able to reduce also the acti-<lb/>vated C = C double bond of enals (2a) and nitro-olefins<lb/> (3a), showing that these systems seem to have a great<lb/> potential for synthetic chemists.<lb/></p>

			<head>Bioconversion of a series of alkyl-substituted<lb/> cyclohex-2-enones<lb/></head>

			<p>Recombinant strains were tested to reduce four alkyl-<lb/>substituted cyclohex-2-enones (4a, 5a, 6a, and 7a; Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/> The substrates were selected in order to investigate the<lb/> versatility and efficiency of these biocatalysts, defining<lb/> how the electronic properties and steric hindrance<lb/> affect substrate reactivity and enzyme stereoselectivity<lb/> in the asymmetric reduction of double bond.<lb/></p>

			<p>All the recombinant yeasts totally reduced 2-cyclohexenone<lb/> (4a) into cyclohexanone (4b) within 2 h (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>),<lb/> yielding no traces of cyclohex-2-enol or cyclohexanol<lb/> (4c), that could result from carbonyl reductases (CR)<lb/> activity on the keto group of 4a or 4b, respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>The strains also reduced 4,4-dimethyl-2-cyclohexe-<lb/>none (5a) into 4,4-dimethyl-cyclohexanone (5b) at a<lb/> good extent, with yields ranging between 76 and 97%.<lb/> The strains carrying the genes from Candida castellii<lb/> DBVPG3704 and Kazachstania lodderae DBVPG6308<lb/> showed the lowest conversions and produced also 4,4-<lb/>dimethyl-2-cyclohexenol (5d; 20% and 15%, respectively)<lb/> through carbonyl reduction of 5a, indicating that CR be-<lb/>came competitive when C = C double bond reduction<lb/> was less effective.<lb/></p>

			<p>The yeast bearing the OYE gene from C. castellii<lb/> DBVPG3704 was the only ineffective in the reduction of<lb/> 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone (6a). All the other strains re-<lb/>duced this substrate with high stereoselectivity (&gt;98%),<lb/> with homogeneous stereobias and formation of (S)-6b as<lb/> the sole detectable enantiomer. Small amounts of 3-<lb/>methylcyclohexanol (6c, 3-6%) were observed after 48 h.<lb/> Conversion yield of 6a towards 6b ranged from 23 to<lb/> 75% after 72 h and was lower compared to the conver-<lb/>sion of substrates 4a and 5a. Consistently, previous stud-<lb/>ies proved that 6a is a &apos;difficult&apos; substrate for enoate<lb/> reductases, due to the presence of a substituent on the<lb/> C3 position <ref type="biblio">[21,22]</ref>. All the recombinant strains failed to<lb/> transform α-isophorone (3,5,5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexenone,<lb/> 7a), neither the C = C or C = O double bonds being re-<lb/>duced after 72 h.<lb/></p>

			<p>As a whole, most of the nine recombinant strains exhib-<lb/>ited similar activity toward the tested cyclohexenone deriv-<lb/>atives and a common stereobias was observed toward 6a.<lb/> Moreover, substrates 4a, 5a, 6a and 7a which are increas-<lb/>ingly sterically hindered, were progressively less reactive in<lb/> C = C reduction. The electronic features of the tested sub-<lb/>strates and the structural properties of the investigated<lb/> OYEs will be thoroughly described in a following section.<lb/></p>

			<head>Computational analysis: evaluation of substrate electronic<lb/> features, and OYE three-dimensional structure prediction<lb/> through comparative modeling<lb/></head>

			<p>The enoate reductases preferentially reduce substrates<lb/> containing electron-poor double bonds <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. In order to<lb/> evaluate the electronic features of the tested substrates, a<lb/> geometry optimization in the gas phase with an approach<lb/> based on density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP/6-31G*)<lb/> was performed, resulting in prediction of the double bond<lb/> lengths and of the electrostatic potential (ESP) derived<lb/> charges for the C atom involved in the hydride attack of<lb/> the substrates (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). A further characterization has<lb/> been carried out by the analysis of the lowest unoccupied<lb/> molecular orbitals (LUMO) for the investigated substrates.<lb/> The surfaces were rendered in order to encapsulate ap-<lb/>proximately 80% of the integral of the evaluated grid points<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Based on the length of the double bonds, 4a,<lb/> 5a, 6a, and 7a resulted very similar. The values 1.34 Å for<lb/> substrates 4a and 5a and 1.35 Å for substrates 6a and 7a,<lb/> typical of the sp 2 hybridization state, were not sufficiently<lb/> different to explain a diverse reactivity based on elec-<lb/>tronic configurations. The comparison among the LUMO<lb/> frontier orbitals revealed very similar configuration and<lb/></p>

			<p>reactivity around the sp 2 carbons of all the substrates.<lb/> Conversely, computed ESP charges suggested that sub-<lb/>strates 5a, 6a, and 7a were the most favored for the<lb/> reduction of the double bond, outcome partially in<lb/> contrast with bioconversion data indicating 6a and 7a<lb/> as &quot;difficult&quot; substrates.<lb/></p>

			<p>The data herein presented demonstrated that the dif-<lb/>ferent reactivity of these substrates cannot be ascribed to<lb/> their electronic configurations. As a whole, the sub-<lb/>strates which are increasingly sterically hindered, were<lb/> progressively less reactive in double bond reduction and<lb/> their electronic properties do not affect this behavior.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to evaluate the role of steric hindrance with re-<lb/>spect to the substrate selectivity, the three-dimensional<lb/> structures of the S. cerevisiae OYE2 and of the K. lodderae<lb/> DBVPG6308 and C. castellii DBVPG3704 enoate reduc-<lb/>tases were predicted through comparative modeling,<lb/> using the structure of the S. pastorianus OYE1 (RCSB<lb/> PDB: 1OYA) as template <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. These three enzymes were<lb/> chosen because, when overexpressed in S. cerevisiae<lb/> BY4741ΔOye2, the corresponding recombinant strains ex-<lb/>hibited different activity and/or enantioselectivity towards<lb/> many of the tested substrates. The proteins and the tem-<lb/>plate OYE1 share a very high level of identity, ranging from<lb/> 73 to 91% (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The active sites are highly<lb/> conserved and few differences in amino acid composition<lb/> are present (Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). Furthermore, similar distances be-<lb/>tween the three core amino acids (His191, Asn194, and<lb/> Tyr196) belonging to the catalytic site have been calculated<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">6</ref>). The high identity between both the primary<lb/> structures of the investigated OYEs and the low root mean<lb/> square deviation (RMSD) values for the modeled structures<lb/> suggested that the different transformation rates of the<lb/> tested substrates can hardly be ascribed only to the struc-<lb/>tural diversity elucidated by our computational work.<lb/></p>

			<p>The substrate α-isophorone (7a) was not reduced by<lb/> OYEs, although electronic features suggested a good re-<lb/>activity, likely because of a dramatic steric effect. A<lb/> docking study of this molecule have been performed on<lb/> the predicted structure of OYE2 protein. The repulsive<lb/> van der Waals interactions between the alkylic groups of<lb/> substrate 7a and Trp116 of OYE2 confirmed that steric<lb/> hindrance was present (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Consistently, in a pre-<lb/>vious study, the interactions between substrates and<lb/> Trp116 in the active site of S. pastorianus OYE1 influ-<lb/>enced the catalytic activity of the enzyme and the stereo-<lb/>chemistry of the products <ref type="biblio">[23]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The analysis of the unfavorable contacts between the side<lb/> chain of Trp116 and the substrates confirmed that the<lb/> transformation efficiency on a series of alkyl-substituted<lb/> cyclohex-2-enones was associated to the length of the<lb/> alkyl-substituent. The larger was the substrate hindrance,<lb/> the lower was the reactivity. Furthermore, the pivotal role<lb/> of Trp116 on catalytic properties of OYE enzymes has<lb/> been highlighted, suggesting this key structural features as<lb/> an hot spot for modification and further improvement of<lb/> the biocatalysts.<lb/></p>

			<p>5a, 6a, and 8a were analyzed until prolonged reaction<lb/> times, in order to obtain also the reduction of the car-<lb/>bonyl group. In all cases we observed a prevailing OYE<lb/> activity in the first hours of reaction, while at longer<lb/> times the carbonyl reductase activity led to the forma-<lb/>tion of the saturated alcohols (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). More in detail,<lb/> using 4a as substrate, it was possible to quantitatively re-<lb/>cover 4b after 2 hours of reaction. Later (144 h), the en-<lb/>dogenous carbonyl reductase(s) led to the formation of<lb/> 4c, with high yield (97%). The same behavior was ob-<lb/>served with substrate 8a: at short reaction times (2 h)<lb/> the OYE product (R)-8b was almost (99%) the only<lb/> chemical species present, whereas a 1/10 ratio between<lb/> 8b and 8c was observed after 168 h; the stereochemical<lb/> analysis of 8c showed that the ratio (1S,2R)-8c/<lb/> (1R,2R)-8c was 70/30. The bioreduction of 6a, that is a<lb/> less reactive substrate, proceeded with the concomitant<lb/> formation of 6b and 6c; 6b was obtained with high<lb/> enantioselectivity (e.e. &gt; 98%). The saturated alcohol (6c)<lb/> was the minor product during the first hours of reaction<lb/> and became the sole product after 120 h; 6c was produced<lb/> with a syn/anti composition of 75/25. In the case of 5a,<lb/> bioreductions proceeded faster: the saturated ketone 5b<lb/> was produced at 95% molar conversion after 1 h while 5c<lb/> reached 95% after 48 h of biotransformation.<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>Overall, our whole-cells system, compared to the use<lb/> of purified enzymes, showed a peculiar synthetic advan-<lb/>tage: with a unique biocatalyst, tuning the reaction time,<lb/> it is possible to have access to different molecules, with<lb/> high yields, starting from a single substrate.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusions<lb/></head>

			<p>S. cerevisiae is well suited for biotechnological applica-<lb/>tions owing to the wealth of the genetic techniques<lb/> available, the ease of manipulation and the rapid<lb/> growth rates. The expression in the host S. cerevisiae<lb/> BY4741ΔOye2 of the OYE genes make possible the ex-<lb/>ploitation of these technological feature leading to the<lb/> development of efficient biocatalysts base on yeast cells.<lb/> The recombinant S. cerevisiae, showed a wide range of<lb/> substrate specificity, being able to reduce the activated<lb/> C = C double bond of enones, enals and nitro-olefins.<lb/> Moreover, whole-cells biocatalysts bypassed the neces-<lb/>sity of the cofactor recycling and, tuning reaction pa-<lb/>rameters, allowed the synthetic exploitation of the<lb/> endogenous carbonyl reductases. Versatility and effi-<lb/>ciency of these biocatalysts was analyzed revealing that<lb/> the different reactivity was not ascribed to substrate<lb/> electronic properties, but steric hindrance resulted the<lb/> most relevant factor affecting the asymmetric reduction<lb/> of double bond. Molecular modeling studies on OYE<lb/> proteins highlighted the pivotal role of Trp116 both in<lb/> activity and stereochemistry and it was established as a<lb/> key structural features for further improvement of cata-<lb/>lytic properties of OYE enzymes.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recombinant cells grown for 24 h were centrifuged<lb/> (5000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C), washed and resuspended<lb/> at a concentration of 15 AU of OD 600 in 100 mM phos-<lb/>phate buffer at pH 7, containing 50 g/L glucose. Sub-<lb/>strate stock solutions (200 g/L) prepared in ethanol were<lb/> added to the reaction obtaining 1 g/L of substrate<lb/> concentration. Biotransformations were carried out in<lb/> baffled Erlenmeyer flasks on orbital shaker, incubated at<lb/> 30°C and 150 rpm. Samples for analysis were extracted 1:1<lb/> with EtOAc containing 0.05% (v/v) of 1-phenylethanol as<lb/> internal GC standard and dried over Na 2 SO 4 . At the end<lb/> of the biotransformation, the whole reaction mixture was<lb/> centrifuged and the aqueous supernatant extracted three<lb/> times with EtOAc. The combined organic phases were<lb/> dried over Na 2 SO 4 and the residue purified by flash<lb/> chromatography.<lb/></p>
