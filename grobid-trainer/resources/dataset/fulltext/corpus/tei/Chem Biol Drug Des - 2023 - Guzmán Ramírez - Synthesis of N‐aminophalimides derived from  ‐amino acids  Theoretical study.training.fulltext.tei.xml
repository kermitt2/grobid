			<p>Phthalimide is an aromatic imide with two carbonyl groups<lb/> bounded to amine moiety and used in organic synthesis for<lb/> the preparation of a wide variety of compounds with differ-<lb/>ent substituents in both the aromatic ring and the nitrogen<lb/> atom. These compounds are attractive for their biological ac-<lb/>tivities <ref type="biblio">(Sharma et al., 2010)</ref> among them, as antibacterial,<lb/> antifungal, antimicrobial, anticancer <ref type="biblio">(Ahmed et al., 2016;<lb/> Akgün et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2009; Tandon et al., 2009;<lb/> Wang et al., 2013)</ref>, as platelet aggregation, tryptase inhib-<lb/>itors <ref type="biblio">(Krysko et al., 2013; Tetsuhashi et al., 2010)</ref>, anti-<lb/>inflammatory and immunomodulatory prototypes <ref type="biblio">(Leite<lb/> et al., 2014)</ref>, hypolipidemic activity <ref type="biblio">(El-Zahabi et al., 2012)</ref>,<lb/> antiangiogenic activity <ref type="biblio">(Nagarajan et al., 2013)</ref>, and HDAC&apos;s<lb/> inhibitors <ref type="biblio">(Lee et al., 2007; Shinji et al., 2005, 2006)</ref>.<lb/></p>

The large family<lb/> of HDAC consists of four classes, according to their se-<lb/>quence homologies to yeast and domain organization,<lb/> those that are zinc-dependent or that require zinc ion to<lb/> carry out their catalytic function: Class I (HDAC1-3, 8),<lb/> class II (HDAC4-7, 9 and 10), and class IV (HDAC11),<lb/> those that are NAD + dependent and structurally different<lb/> from other HDACs called sirtuins: class III (Sir 1-7) <ref type="biblio">(Gre-<lb/>goretti et al., 2004)</ref>. HDAC8 is the most-studied HDAC<lb/> isoform due to its human oncological relevance and it is<lb/> known that the overexpression of HDAC8 has been linked<lb/> with various types of cancer such as pancreas, colon,<lb/> lung, childhood neuroblastoma, and breast <ref type="biblio">(Falkenberg<lb/> &amp; Johnstone, 2014)</ref>.

			<p>On this background, our research has been interesting<lb/> in the synthesis of compounds derived from α-amino acids<lb/> and in researching their biological properties, for instance,<lb/> we have synthesized and carried out docking studies and in<lb/> vitro assays of some 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole derived from<lb/> α-amino acids as channel blockers, Cox-1 and -2 inhibitors,<lb/> effect over HDAC8 activity and expression, and HDACs in-<lb/>hibitors, as well as effect on the K14E6 transgenic mouse<lb/> model <ref type="biblio">(Mancilla et al., 2001; Mancilla-Percino et al., 2010,<lb/> 2016; Rodríguez-Uribe et al., 2018, 2020; Santamaria-<lb/>Herrera et al., 2016; Trejo Muñoz et al., 2014)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thus, continuing with our studies, in this work, we<lb/> present the synthesis of novel N-aminophalimides 5(a-<lb/>c) and 6(a-c) derived from α-amino acids, which have<lb/> the phthalimide moiety as analogous compounds stud-<lb/>ied as anticancer agents and HDAC inhibitors, as well<lb/> as new 3(a-c), 4(a-c) acetamides as precursors of N-<lb/>aminophalimides. The compounds under study were se-<lb/>lected to their synthesis from molecular docking results of<lb/> acetamides y N-aminophalimides derived of 20 α-amino<lb/> acids against HDAC8. All compounds synthetized in this<lb/> work were characterized by nuclear magnetic and high-<lb/>resolution mass spectrometry, and confirmation of the<lb/> structures of 4a, 5a, 5b, 6a, and 6b by X-ray diffraction.<lb/> Furthermore, evaluation of the inhibitory activity of 3(a-<lb/>c), 5(a-c), and 6(a-c) on HDAC8 enzyme is reported.<lb/></p>

			<p>The synthetic route leading to the formation of the target<lb/> compounds 3(a-c), 4(a-c), 5(a-c), and 6(a-c) is outlined<lb/> in Scheme 1. Compound 2, which was raw material, was<lb/> obtained by the reaction of Bromo acetic acid 1 with tert-<lb/>butanol in the presence of NaH. Compound 2 was con-<lb/>verted by a coupling reaction to tert-butoxyacetamides<lb/> methyl ester 3(a-c) with corresponding α-amino methyl<lb/> ester hydrochloride (a, b, and c: Gly, Phe, and Trp derived,<lb/> respectively), using T3P® in DCM or ACN depending on<lb/> their solubility. Compounds 3(a-c) were then converted<lb/> into the corresponding tert-butoxyacetamides 4(a-c) after<lb/> alkaline hydrolysis using potassium hydroxide in aqueous<lb/> methanol. Compounds 5(a-c) were obtained through the<lb/> coupling between N-aminophthalimide and correspond-<lb/>ing 4(a-c), using HATU as coupling reagent with stir-<lb/>ring at room temperature overnight. Finally, 6(a-c) were<lb/> obtained by the deprotection of the hydroxyl group with<lb/> Amberlite® IR120 hydrogen form under methanol reflux<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Mallesha et al., 2012)</ref>.<lb/></p>

In particular, the crystal structure of HDAC8-<lb/>TSA complex (PDB ID: 1T64) <ref type="biblio">(Somoza et al., 2004)</ref>, shows<lb/> that TSA binds at two pockets, in this sense, it has been<lb/> considered as competitive inhibitor because it is binding<lb/> at catalytic pocket and noncompetitive inhibitor since<lb/> is noncatalytic binding pocket <ref type="biblio">(Su et al., 2008)</ref>. The or-<lb/>thosteric that is the active site is described as a long and<lb/> narrow tunnel constituted for the amino acids residues<lb/> His142, His143, Gly151, Phe152, His180, Phe208, Met274,<lb/> and Tyr306 <ref type="biblio">(Somoza et al., 2004; Vannini et al., 2004)</ref>, at<lb/> the bottom of this tunnel, the catalytic site is found, which<lb/> is formed by Zn 2+ ion and the catalytic triad of His142,<lb/> His143, and Tyr306n <ref type="biblio">(Gantt et al., 2016)</ref>. One of the char-<lb/>acteristics in HDAC8 is loop L1, which is formed by seven<lb/> amino acid residues (Ser30, Leu31, Ala32, Lys33, Ile34,<lb/> Pro35, and Lys36) <ref type="biblio">(Maolanon et al., 2016)</ref>, is highly flex-<lb/>ible and found toward the proximity of the active site<lb/> and can undergo conformational changes for substrates<lb/> binding.<lb/></p>

			<p>Thus, in this work, we described the binding mode<lb/> of 3(a-c), 4(a-c), 5(a-c), and 6(a-c), as well as for TSA<lb/> on two pockets of X-ray structure of HDAC8 (PDB ID:<lb/> 1T64). Hence, a molecular docking study was performed<lb/> to investigate binding modes of compounds 3(a-t), 4(a-<lb/>t), 5(a-t), and 6(a-t) derived of 20 α-amino acids (Gly,<lb/> Phe, Trp, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Tyr, Ser, Pro, Thr, Cis,<lb/> Asn, Gln, Lys, His, Arg, Asp, and Glu) on HDAC8; results<lb/></p>

			<p>showed that most of the compounds binding in both or-<lb/>thosteric and allosteric site of the enzyme, as it has been<lb/> observed for TSA (Docking data are given in SI). Based<lb/> on the results, compounds 3(a-c), 4(a-t), 5(a-t), and<lb/> 6(a-t) were selected for analysis of the binding modes<lb/> on the X-ray structure of HDAC8 (PDB ID: 1T64). The<lb/> docking protocol was confirmed through the re-docking<lb/> of the co-crystallized TSA within the HDAC8 structure.<lb/> It showed that the inhibitor bound into both pockets<lb/> of the enzyme providing an RMSD value of 0.9304 and<lb/> 1.3509 Å. Therefore, the docking protocol was reliable<lb/> for the analysis of the binding modes of the target com-<lb/>pounds with HDAC8.<lb/> </p>

			<p>The Gibbs free energies (ΔG, kcal/mol), along with<lb/> the corresponding dissociation constants (K d , μM) val-<lb/>ues were obtained for the four series HDAC8-ligands<lb/> complexes in each pocket, showing all these compounds<lb/> more affinity at the allosteric pocket than in orthosteric<lb/> pocket, except 5c, and 4a that did not show affinity to<lb/> orthosteric site. Furthermore, compounds 5b, 6b, and 6c<lb/> inhibited more affinity than TSA. The data are summa-<lb/>rized in Table <ref type="table">4</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The study of binding modes of <ref type="figure">3(a-c), 4(a-c), 5(a-<lb/>c), and 6(a-c</ref>) and TSA with amino acid residues of both<lb/> pockets of HDAC8 was based on the analysis of the type<lb/> of interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, π-π interactions<lb/> coordination bonds, π-sulfur, π-lone pairs, and π-cation<lb/> interactions, where the analysis of the distances were<lb/> considered as &lt;4 Å for hydrogen bonds and &lt;6 Å for hy-<lb/>drophobic interactions, <ref type="biblio">(Brylinski, 2018; Copeland, 2000)<lb/></ref> between heteroatoms, carbons, or protons coupled to het-<lb/>eroatoms of all target acetamides to atoms of amino acids<lb/> residues of HDAC8.

			<p>ester moiety of 3a showed a coordination bond to Zn 2+ at<lb/> 2.22 Å, by hydrogen bonds with the proton of OH (side<lb/> chain) of Tyr306 (2.23 Å) and with the NH (backbone)<lb/> of Gly304 (2.51 Å). A carbon atom from the tert-butoxy<lb/> moiety showed hydrophobic binds alkyl-π (side chain) of<lb/> Phe208 (3.71 Å) and Phe152 (4.23 Å). Acetamides 3b and<lb/> 3c, which have the phenyl and indole groups at position<lb/> three, respectively, showed that both groups interacted<lb/> with the amino acid residues of the surface of the enzyme<lb/> in the vicinity of the opening of the active site, exhibiting<lb/> different orientation, and bind modes to that observed for<lb/> 3a, which does not have a substituent at position three.<lb/> This can be attributed to the different conformations<lb/> adopted by the three acetamides in the pocket.<lb/> </p>

			<p>Thus, the oxygen atom of tert-butoxy group of 3b exhib-<lb/>ited a hydrogen bond with the proton of NH (backbone)<lb/> of Phe208 at 2.12 Å, phenyl group exhibited π-π T-shaped<lb/> interaction with Phe152 at 4.89 Å, and π-lone pair interac-<lb/>tion (side chain) with His180 at 4.09 Å. Hydrogens, NH-3<lb/> and NH of indole group of 3c showed hydrogen bonds<lb/> with the oxygen of carbonyl (backbone) of Gly206 (1.99 Å)<lb/> and carbonyl (side chain) of Asp101 (2.09 Å), respectively;<lb/> indole exhibited π-π stacking interactions with Phe208 at<lb/> 3.82 and 3.94 Å, and π-sulfur interaction with Met274 at<lb/> 5.18 Å. The results show that compounds 3(a-c) bonded<lb/> to the residues of the active site of HDAC8, and 3a ad-<lb/>ditionally bonded to zinc ion, suggesting it bonded in a<lb/> competitive manner. Compounds 3b and 3c also showed<lb/> interactions with the amino acid residues that do not be-<lb/>long to the active site, which are in the L8 loop as Tyr306,<lb/> the L5 loop as Phe 208, and Asp101 residue is strictly con-<lb/>served in the L2 loop of all class I and class II HDAC&apos;s and<lb/> has been established that is important for the substrate<lb/> recognition <ref type="biblio">(Dowling et al., 2008; Estiu et al., 2010; Van-<lb/>nini et al., 2007)</ref>. The results showed that the ester group<lb/> of 3a oriented toward the catalytic site as the hydroxamic<lb/> group of TSA. Also, acetamides and inhibitor showed in-<lb/>teractions with the same amino residues of the active site<lb/> Phe152, Phe208, Gly304, Met274, and Tyr306. Therefore,<lb/> acetamides 3(a-c) may be considered as possible HDAC8<lb/> inhibitors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Acetamides 3(a-c) exhibited different conformations<lb/> between them at the allosteric site of HDAC8, therefore<lb/> displayed the following binds, 3a showed four hydrogen<lb/> bonds, NH-3 with C=O (backbone) of Cys28 at 2.79 Å,<lb/> with C=O (side chain) of Asp29 at 2.21 Å and the oxygen<lb/> atom of the C=O-4 with NH 2 of guanidine group (side<lb/> chain) of Arg37 at 1.88 Å. A carbon atom from tert-butoxy<lb/> moiety showed alkyl-π interaction with Tyr306 at 5.05 Å.<lb/> Compound 3b showed two hydrogen bonds, the oxygen<lb/> atom of C=O-1 with NH (backbone) of Arg37 at 2.15 Å<lb/> and NH-3 with OH (side chain) of Tyr111 at 2.50 Å, and<lb/> the phenyl group exhibited π-π T-shaped interaction with<lb/> Tyr 306 at 5.03 Å. Indole moiety of 3c showed π-alkyl in-<lb/>teraction with C (side chain) of Arg37 at 4.97 Å and π-<lb/>guanidine group protonated interaction (side chain) at<lb/> 4.45 Å. NH of indole moiety exhibited a hydrogen bond<lb/> with OH (side chain) of Tyr111 at 1.88 Å, also indole group<lb/> showed π-π stacked interaction with Trp141 at 4.38 Å.<lb/> Among the common binding of these compounds are to<lb/> Arg37 through C=O-4 and C=O-1 of 3a and 3b, respec-<lb/>tively, and indole group of 3c, acetamides 3a and 3d bind<lb/> to Tyr306 through tert-butoxy moiety and phenyl moiety,<lb/> respectively; 3b and 3c bind to Tyr111 by NH-3 and NH<lb/> of indole moiety, (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). These results revealed that<lb/> both acetamides and TSA bind to the amino acid residues<lb/> Arg37, Tyr111, and Ser138 in the allosteric site of HDAC8,<lb/> but different binding types depending on their conforma-<lb/>tion adopted at the site.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2 | Binding modes of compounds 4(a-c)<lb/> with HDAC8<lb/></head>

			<p>Compounds 4(a-c), which have a carboxylic group instead<lb/> of the ester group of their precursors 3(a-c), showed dif-<lb/>ferent orientations and binding types in the orthosteric<lb/> site in comparison with those of 3(a-c), except 4a that did<lb/> not show interactions in this pocket. Thus, the tert-butoxy<lb/> group of 4b and 4c orient toward the inside of the tunnel,<lb/> while the groups of 3b and 3c oriented inside were phe-<lb/>nyl and indole, respectively. Two carbon atoms of the tert-<lb/>butoxy moiety of 4b exhibited alkyl-π interactions with<lb/> side chains of His143, Phe152, and His180 at 3.89, 4.44,<lb/> and 4.12 Å, respectively, and two carbon atoms of the tert-<lb/>butoxy group of 4c displayed alkyl-π interactions with the<lb/> side chain of Phe152 (4.20, 4.60 Å), His180 (4.44 Å), Tyr306<lb/> (4.18 Å), and Met274 at (4.59 Å). C=O-1 of 4b and 4c bind<lb/> by a hydrogen bond to NH (backbone) of Phe208 at 1.88<lb/> and 1.79 Å, respectively. The hydrogen atom of the carbox-<lb/>ylic acid of 4b exhibited hydrogen bond with N (side chain)<lb/> of His180 at 2.24 Å, NH-3 of 4b and 4c displayed hydrogen<lb/> bonds with N (side chain) of His180 at 2.72 and 2.14 Å, re-<lb/>spectively. C-5 of 4c exhibited alkyl-π interaction with the<lb/> side chain of Phe208 at 3.70 Å. NH of indole moiety of 4c<lb/> bind by a hydrogen bond to C=O (backbone) of Pro273 at<lb/> 2.01 Å, although it does not belong to active site residues,<lb/> it is joined to Met274, and indole moiety exhibited bind<lb/> π-alkyl interaction with C (side chain) of Met274 at 4.17 Å.<lb/> These data showed that 4b and 4c interacted to the amino<lb/> acid residues of the active site of HDAC8 and that carbox-<lb/>ylic acid moiety contributed to the orientation of the mole-<lb/>cules where tert-butoxy moiety, although voluminous, was<lb/> oriented in the tunnel. These two acetamides and inhibitor<lb/> showed binding with the same amino residues of the ac-<lb/>tive site Phe152, Phe208, Met274, and Tyr306, where 4c<lb/> displayed more bindings. Therefore, 4(b-c) may be con-<lb/>sidered HDAC8 inhibitors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Compounds 4(a-c) in the allosteric site showed the fol-<lb/>lowing binding, for 4a, hydrogen bonds HO of the carbox-<lb/>ylic acid with OH (side chain) of Ser138 at 2.18 Å, C=O-1<lb/> with guanidine group (side chain) of Arg37 at 1.63 Å, and<lb/> with NH-3 (backbone) of Cys28 at 2.15 Å, and hydrophobic<lb/> interactions alkyl-π interactions between carbon atoms of<lb/> tert-butoxy moiety and (side chain) of Trp141 and Tyr306<lb/> at 4.89 and 4.94 Å, respectively. 4b exhibited the following<lb/> hydrogen bonds, the proton of carboxylic acid moiety with<lb/> C=O (backbone) of Cys28 and C=O (side chain) of Asp29<lb/> at 2.89 and 1.80 Å, respectively, NH-3 with (backbone) of<lb/> Pro35 at 2.5 Å, and phenyl moiety showed π-π T-shaped in-<lb/>teraction with (side chain) of Trp141 at 4.77 Å. 4c displayed<lb/> hydrogen bonds between NH-3 with C=O (backbone) of<lb/> Pro35 at 2.15 Å, NH of indole group with OH (side chain)<lb/> of Trp141 at 1.80 Å, and hydrophobic π-sigma interaction<lb/> was observed between indole moiety and (side chain) of<lb/> Ile34 at 3.58 Å. Carbons of tert-butoxy moiety exhibited<lb/> alkyl interaction with C (side chain) of Arg37 at 3.99 Å, and<lb/> Trp141 at 3.99 and 4.46 Å, respectively. These acetamides<lb/> showed binding with Try141, which is one of the residues<lb/> that form the wall between the two pockets, they also show<lb/> inhibitor shown interactions with the same amino acid res-<lb/>idues Pro35, Arg37, Ser138, and Tyr111 (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>4.3 | Binding modes of compounds 5(a-c)<lb/> with HDAC8<lb/></head>

			<p>Compounds 5(a-c), which have N-aminophthalimide<lb/> group showed differences in the orientation of the com-<lb/>pounds toward the orthosteric site, phthalimide group of<lb/> 5a and 5c was orient to the pocket favoring hydrophobic<lb/> interactions and with the residues that they form the walls<lb/> of the channel, while 5b maintains the orientation of the<lb/> tert-butyl group toward the pocket, leaving the indole part<lb/> on the surface, which allows greater interaction with sur-<lb/>face residues and aromatic groups of the amino acids resi-<lb/>dues. The types of binding are described below.<lb/></p>

			<p>The oxygen atom of C=O-1 and NH-3 of 5a bind by<lb/> hydrogen bonds with NH (backbone) of Phe208 and the<lb/> oxygen of Gly206 at 1.86 and 2.15 Å, respectively, π-π<lb/> T-shaped interactions were between phthalimide moi-<lb/>ety and the side chain of His180 and Phe208 at 4.69 and<lb/> 4.12 Å, also π-sulfur interaction between phthalimide<lb/> and Met274 at 5.06 Å was observed. Compound 5b only<lb/> showed π-alkyl interactions between phthalimide moiety<lb/> and the side chain of Pro35 at 5.46 Å, and π-π T-shaped<lb/> interactions with the side chain of Phe152 and Tyr306 at<lb/> 4.45 and 5.38 Å. Carbon atoms of the tert-butoxy group<lb/> π-alkyl interactions with His143, His180, and Phe208<lb/> were displayed at 4.71, 3.59, and 4.23 Å, respectively,<lb/> also phenyl moiety presented π-sulfur interaction with<lb/> Met274 at 4.47 Å. NH of indole moiety of 5c showed a<lb/></p>

			<p>hydrogen bond with the backbone of Gly206 at 1.97 Å,<lb/> and carbon atoms of tert-butoxy moiety exhibited π-alkyl<lb/> interactions with the side chain of Phe207 and Met274<lb/> at 4.62 and 4.16 Å, respectively. These results showed<lb/> that although no compound showed the suitable con-<lb/>formation to bind the zinc ion, they and TSA displayed<lb/> interactions with the same amino acid residues of the<lb/> active site Phe152, Phe208, Met274, and Tyr306. Besides,<lb/> phenyl moiety of TSA showed binding only with Met274,<lb/> and the phthalimide group of 5a and 5b displayed bind-<lb/>ing with His180, Phe208, Met274, and Phe208, Tyr306,<lb/> respectively, while that of 5c did not show bind. There-<lb/>fore, 5(a-c) could be considered as possible HDAC8<lb/> inhibitors.<lb/></p>

			<p>Compounds 5(a-c) in the allosteric site showed the<lb/> following binds, phthalimide moiety of 5a exhibited π-π<lb/> T-shaped interactions with the side chain of Phe208 (4.51<lb/> and 4.75 Å), 5b with the side chain of Tyr306 at 5.09 Å,<lb/> and π-alkyl interactions of these compounds with the side<lb/> chain of Pro35 (3.72, 4.0, and 3.63 Å). While phthalimide<lb/> moiety of 5c displayed π-alkyl interactions with the side<lb/> chain of Ile34 and Pro35 at 4.96 and 4.50 Å, respectively.<lb/> NH-3 and oxygen atom of the tert-butoxy moiety of 5a<lb/> showed hydrogen bonds with OH of the side chain of<lb/> Tyr111 at 2.11 and 2.27 Å.

Phenyl moiety of 5b showed<lb/> π-guanidine group protonated interaction (side chain) of<lb/> Arg37 at 3.97 Å, and indole moiety of 5c exhibited π-π T-<lb/>shaped interaction with the side chain of Tyr100 at 5.08 Å<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The data showed that phthalimide moiety of<lb/> 5(a-c) showed binding with Pro35, Arg37, Ile34, Phe208,<lb/> and Tyr306, while phenyl moiety of TSA showed binding<lb/> with Pro35 and Phe152. 5a and 5b conformations allowed<lb/> to these binding with the inner amino acid residues of the<lb/> pocket (Tyr111, Trp141, Phe208, and Tyr306), where these<lb/> compounds and TSA showed binding with Tyr111, while<lb/></p>

			<p>It is known that several classes of small molecule have<lb/> been recognized as HDAC inhibitors, most of these are<lb/> hydroxamic acid derivatives, exemplified by suberoylani-<lb/>lide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), where hydroxamate moiety<lb/> chelate the zinc ion in the active site. While hydroxamic<lb/> acid group is responsible for various potent inhibitors,<lb/> they usually have many problems associated with their<lb/> use such as low oral availability, poor in vivo stability, and<lb/> undesirable side effects. Based on the above, research on<lb/> this topic was focused on the replacement of hydroxam-<lb/>ate by non-hydroxamate groups to find potent molecules<lb/> as inhibitors of HDACs, thus, several suberoylanilide<lb/> hydroxamic acid (SAHA)-based compounds have been<lb/> synthesized containing sulfonamide, sulfone, aminoca-<lb/>tetamide, hydroxyacetamine, and mercaptoacetamide as<lb/> ZBG. The kinetic enzyme assays and molecular modeling<lb/> suggested that compounds with mercaptoacetamide moi-<lb/>ety interacts with the zinc in the active site of HDACs <ref type="biblio">(Su-<lb/>zuki et al., 2005; Wang &amp; Dymock, 2009)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this context, compounds 6(a-c) are attractive<lb/> because having a hydroxyacetamide moiety as a zinc-<lb/>binding group (ZBG), a phthalimide moiety as a capping<lb/> group, and aminoacetamide moiety as a linker group,<lb/> which are important in the ligand-receptor binding<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Marks et al., 2003</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure">7</ref>). The binding modes of these<lb/> compounds with HDAC8 depend on their conformations<lb/> led to different orientations on each site. Hydroxyl group<lb/></p>

			<p>of 6a was orient toward the inner of the orthosteric site,<lb/> where the oxygen of C=O-4 showed binding at zinc ion<lb/> at 2.05 Å. Also, 6a exhibited hydrogen bonds with the<lb/> enzyme as follows, hydrogen of NH-3 with oxygen atom<lb/> (backbone) of Gly151 at 2.5 Å, oxygen of C=O-4 with OH<lb/> (side chain) of Tyr306 at 2.22 Å, hydrogen of NH with oxy-<lb/>gen atom (backbone) of Gly304 at 2.61 Å, and hydrogen of<lb/> OH group bind to an oxygen atom (side chain) of Asp178<lb/> at 2.10 Å. Phthalimide moiety showed π-π stacking inter-<lb/>actions with Phe208 at 3.83 and 4.44 Å. Due to 6a binding<lb/> to zinc ion and Asp178, Phe208, and Tyr306 just like TSA,<lb/> it may be promising as an HDAC8 inhibitor, and a candi-<lb/>date for additional studies.<lb/></p>

			<p>Compounds 6b and 6c were oriented at the active<lb/> site in a different way than 6a because they had different<lb/> conformations. Although these compounds did not show<lb/> interaction with the zinc ion, they showed binding inter-<lb/>actions with the amino acid residues of the active site.<lb/> Compound 6b displayed interactions by hydrogen bonds<lb/> as follows, hydrogen of NH-3 and that of hydroxyl group<lb/> interacted with oxygen (side chain) of Asp101 at 2.08 and<lb/> 1.97 Å, respectively, the oxygen atom of C=O-8 with NH<lb/> (backbone) of Phe208 at 1.97 Å. The aromatic moiety of<lb/> phthalimide of 6b exhibited π-π T-shaped interaction<lb/> whit (side chain) of His180 at 5.67 Å and π-alkyl with<lb/> (side chain) of Met274 at 4.38 and 4.60 Å. Compound 6c<lb/> exhibited interactions by hydrogen bonds as follows: Oxy-<lb/>gen atom of C=O-4 with the hydrogen of NH (backbone)<lb/> of Phe208 at 1.69 Å, hydrogen of OH group with oxygen<lb/> (side chain) of Gly206 at 1.77 Å, NH-6 with S (side chain)<lb/> of Met274 at 2.98 Å, and the oxygen atom of C=O-8 with<lb/> NH (side chain) Lys202 at 2.20 Å. The phthalimide moiety<lb/> showed π-alkyl interaction with (side chain) of Met274 at<lb/> 5.02 Å, indole moiety showed the π-π T-shaped interac-<lb/>tions with Phe152 (4.78 Å) and His180 (4.31 Å), and the<lb/> π-π stacked with Phe208 at 4.13 and 4.86 Å. As it is men-<lb/>tioned above, although 6b and 6c did not interact with<lb/> zinc ion, they showed binding interactions with the amino<lb/> acid residues of the active site Phe208 and Met274 as well<lb/> as TSA; therefore, these compounds could be considered<lb/> for further studies, (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Compounds 6(a-c) in the<lb/> allosteric site showed hydrogen bonds interactions of the<lb/> oxygen atoms of C=O-1 and C=O-4 of 6a with guanidine<lb/> moiety (side chain) of Arg37 at 2.66 and 2.49 Å, respec-<lb/>tively, whereas only oxygen atom of C=O-4 of 6b bind to<lb/> Arg37 at 1.83 Å, NH-6 of 6a and 6b with oxygen (back-<lb/>bone) of Pro35 at 1.78 and 2.18 Å, respectively, oxygen of<lb/> OH group of 6a with OH (side chain) of Tyr111 and hy-<lb/>drogen of HO with of 6a (side chain) of Ser138 at 1.80 and<lb/> 2.10 Å, hydrogen of OH group of 6b with oxygen (back-<lb/>bone) of Ser138 at 1.66 Å, and hydrogen of OH group of 6c<lb/> whit OH (side chain) of Tyr111 and oxygen (backbone) of<lb/> Phe152 at 1.95 and 2.07 Å.<lb/></p>

			<p>The phthalimide moiety displayed the following in-<lb/>teractions: For that of 6a π-alkyl with CH 2 (side chain)<lb/> of Pro35 (4.13 Å), CH 2 (side chain) of Arg37 (5.15 Å), and<lb/> π-π T-shaped (side chain) of Phe152 at 4.82 Å, for 6b and<lb/> 6c a π-π T-shaped with the side chain of Tyr306 at 4.54<lb/> and 4.53 Å, respectively. Phenyl moiety of 6b displayed<lb/> π-π stacking interaction with the side chain of Tyr111 at<lb/> 4.61 Å. The hydrogen of NH of indole moiety of 6c showed<lb/> a hydrogen bond with oxygen (backbone) of Pro35 at<lb/> 1.75 Å, and the indole moiety exhibited π-π T-shaped in-<lb/>teraction with (side chain) of Tyr111 at 5.91 (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>).<lb/> The results showed that phthalimide moiety of 6a bound<lb/> with Ile34, Pro35, and Phe152, and that of 6b and 6c with<lb/> Tyr306, while phenyl moiety of TSA bind with Pro35 and<lb/> Phe152. The hydroxy group of these compounds bind with<lb/> Tyr111 (6a, 6c), Ser138 (6a, 6b), and Phe152 (6c), while<lb/> the hydroxamic moiety of TSA did not display interaction<lb/> in this pocket, but the inhibitor showed interactions with<lb/> the same amino acid residues by binding mode different to<lb/> those of the target compounds. Thus, compounds 6(a-c)<lb/> are promising for further studies.<lb/></p>

			<head>5 | HDAC8 INHIBITORY ASSAY<lb/></head>

			<p>It is known that several drugs have been identified to in-<lb/>hibit class I and/or class II histone deacetylases (HDACs),<lb/> of which Trichostatin A (TSA) is one of the well-known<lb/> HDAC inhibitors. However, little is known about the<lb/> effect of TSA on HDAC8, of which is the inhibition of<lb/> proliferation of Molt-4 cells which express HDAC8 <ref type="biblio">(Jing<lb/> et al., 2006)</ref>. Another study has been conducted to explore<lb/> whether the function of HDACs was modulated by TSA at<lb/> concentrations that block cancer cell viability by enzyme<lb/> activity assays in purified systems and in cell extracts.<lb/> TSA&apos;s effective killing dose of 400 nM fully inhibited<lb/> HDAC1 and HDAC2, and HDAC8 only partly activity,<lb/> however, 5 mM TSA fully eliminated its activity <ref type="biblio">(Chang<lb/> et al., 2012)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The inhibitory activity of compounds 3(a-c), 5(a-c),<lb/> and 6(a-c) on HDAC8 was evaluated based on the results<lb/> obtained from the docking study because they presented<lb/> better values of ΔG and K d than 4(a-c), and even 4a did<lb/> not present interactions in the orthosteric site of HDAC8.<lb/> The in vitro inhibitory activity of target acetamides was<lb/> evaluated with the HDAC8 Fluorometric Drug Discovery<lb/> Kit, TSA as a control inhibitor included in the Kit. Table <ref type="table">5<lb/></ref> shows the IC 50 values, although 5(a-c) showed better<lb/> values of ΔG and K d from the docking study than 3(a-c),<lb/> both series exhibited almost the same inhibitory effect<lb/> in the range of 0.751-0.445 μM. Regarding compounds<lb/> 6(a-c), that displayed better affinity in docking, 6a (IC 50<lb/> of 28 nM) and 6b (IC 50 = 0.18 μM) revealed the best effect<lb/> inhibitory effect on HDAC8, except for 6c. Compound 6a<lb/> showed the best IC 50 slightly above the TSA.<lb/></p>

			<head>6 | CONCLUSION<lb/></head>

			<p>Twelve new acetamides and novel N-aminophalimides<lb/> derived from α-amino acids were selected for their syn-<lb/>thesis from docking study and were obtained in good<lb/> yields; they were characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR, infra-<lb/>red, HRMS, and structures of 4a, 5a, 5b, 6a, and 6b were<lb/> confirmed by X-ray crystallography. The molecular dock-<lb/>ing results showed that all compounds, except 4a binds<lb/> in both pockets, and their orientation within HDAC8<lb/> depended on the conformation in each site. In general,<lb/> acetamides without and with phthalimide moiety showed<lb/> interactions with the amino acid residues of the active site<lb/> and allosteric site, where binding modes were similar or<lb/> different to those displayed for TSA. Although only 3a and<lb/> 6a displayed interaction with the Zn, all target acetamides<lb/> studied may be considered for further studies. According<lb/> to the inhibition assays, all the evaluated acetamides ex-<lb/>hibited inhibitory activity on HDAC8. Among them, 6a<lb/> (IC 50 = 28 nM) and 6b showed better enzymatic inhibitory,<lb/> where 6a showed the greatest effect, slightly less than<lb/> TSA (IC 50 = 26 nM). These results suggested that the tar-<lb/>get acetamides and N-aminophalimides may be promising<lb/> anticancer agents for further biological studies.<lb/></p>
