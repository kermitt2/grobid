			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Epoxy-based polymeric materials have been extensively applied to a wide range of fields, for example paints, coatings, adhesives,<lb/> aerospace industry and electronics materials because of their high mechanical properties, good thermal/chemical resistances, and high<lb/> adhesiveness to versatile substrates <ref type="biblio">[1-3]</ref>. Although they are widely used as electronics packaging materials, the properties of con-<lb/>ventional epoxy-based materials (e.g., bisphenol A type diglycidyl ether) do not meet the requirements of advanced electronics ma-<lb/>terials, which include high thermal conductivity, stability, mechanical properties, and electrical performance <ref type="biblio">[4-6]</ref>. A high thermal<lb/> conductivity is critical for decreasing internal overheating, which can generate cracks or deformations in the microlevel structure of<lb/> high-efficiency electronics devices <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>. These cracks and deformations can cause system failures, human health and safety problems,<lb/> and assembly loss in the electronics components <ref type="biblio">[8,9]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Incorporating filler materials with high thermal conductivity into an epoxy-based polymeric matrix to form composites is an<lb/> effective method to improve thermal performance in cases where the thermal conductivity of epoxy-based materials is too low for<lb/> removing the heat generated by electronics devices. Typical thermally conductive filler materials include metallic, ceramic particles,<lb/> and carbon-based materials (e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene) <ref type="biblio">[7,8,10,11]</ref>. Among various thermally conductive fillers, alumina<lb/> particles (APs) have utilized as filler materials for the thermal management of electronics because of their high thermal conductivity<lb/> (30 W/m K), and cost effectiveness <ref type="biblio">[10,12-15]</ref>. However, the traditional strategy for fabricating AP-incorporated epoxy-based<lb/> composites limits to enhancing the thermal performance of composites because of the issues of the uniform distribution of AP in<lb/> matrix. Moreover, conventional epoxy-based polymeric materials show low thermal stability and other physical properties, which<lb/> hinder uses in advanced electronic devices <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Improving thermal conductivity of composites consisting of inorganic fillers and polymer matrices can be achieved by percolation<lb/> of inorganic fillers; the effective thermal pathway that can be generated by proper contact of inorganic fillers makes enhanced thermal<lb/> conductivity of the composites. Thus, uniform distribution of inorganic fillers in the composites is crucial for effective percolation;<lb/> aggregated and/or isolated fillers cannot contribute to the thermal pathway. To attain uniform dispersion of inorganic fillers, optimal<lb/> fabrication methods can be considered because typical fabrication methods of composites suffer from sedimentation of inorganic fillers<lb/> which may hinder thermal percolation while curing process of organic matrices. Thus, preventing particle&apos;s sedimentation should be<lb/> guaranteed while fabrication process.<lb/></p>

			<p>Photo-curing process by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (UV-curing) is often used for fabricating various composites due to its fast<lb/> curing time and low shrinkage <ref type="biblio">[16,17]</ref>. Photo-cured composites can ensure uniform composite structure compared to thermal cured;<lb/> inorganic fillers can be uniformly distributed due to UV-induced fast curing of organic matrices, so particle&apos;s sedimentation can be<lb/> prevented. For fabricating electronic packaging composites, however, photo-curing has been rarely utilized because typical<lb/> epoxy-based polymer matrices in electronic packaging require sufficient thermal energies to be completely cured.<lb/></p>

			<p>Organic-inorganic siloxane hybrid materials derived from sol-gel hydrolysis and condensation have been utilized widely in the past<lb/> few decades because of their various advantages including high optical properties and excellent thermo-mechanical characteristics<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[16,18,19]</ref>. Given these high performances, siloxane hybrid materials have been used in a wide range of applications, for example,<lb/> flexible substrates <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>, functional coatings <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>, encapsulation of nanocrystals <ref type="biblio">[22,23]</ref>, dielectrics <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref>, and electronics packaging <ref type="biblio">[3,<lb/> 5]</ref>. In particular, thermal stability of siloxane hybrid materials is considerably higher than that of conventional polymers containing<lb/> epoxy-based materials because they have robust inorganic siloxane networks (composed of Si-O-Si bonds) that have a higher bond<lb/> energy than the carbon bond (bond energy: Si-O = 452 kJ/mol, and C-C = 346 kJ/mol) <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>. Furthermore, other physicochemical<lb/> properties, such as chemical inertness and mechanical durability, can also be obtained with thermal stability. In addition, some<lb/> organo-siloxane matrices, such as cycloaliphatic epoxy-based siloxane, can be applied to UV-curing process <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on the above considerations, we developed UV-curable and robust alumina-incorporated cycloaliphatic epoxy-based com-<lb/>posites (AP-EPSH) with superior thermal conductivity (&gt;11 W/m K) for electronic packaging. The composites consist of bimodal sized<lb/> micro-alumina particles (APs) (average size of 2 μm (SAP) and 45 μm (LAP)) with fillers and UV-curable cycloaliphatic-epoxy-siloxane<lb/> (EPSH) matrix with high thermal stability. For uniform distribution of the AP fillers in the composites, the size and composition of AP<lb/> fillers are optimized based on the theoretical packing density rule. For robustness and photo-curability of the composites,<lb/> cycloaliphatic-epoxy-siloxane matrix is utilized owing to its capability of cationic curing. We investigated the changes in thermal,<lb/> mechanical, and electrical performances by varying size and composition of bimodal sized APs in the siloxane matrix. In addition,<lb/> different curing mechanisms (UV-and thermal-curing) are implemented for fabrication of the composites to assess the effects on<lb/> subsequent thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties.<lb/></p>

            <head>2. Materials and methods<lb/></head>

            <head>2.1. Materials<lb/></head>

			<p>Diphenylsilanediol (DPSD, Gelest, USA), 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane (ECTS, Gelest, U.S.A.), 3-ethyl-3 [(3-<lb/>ethyloxetane-3-yl)methoxy]methyl oxetane (DOX, Toagosei, Japan), APs (SAP and LAP) (AnHui Estone Material Technology Co.,<lb/> Ltd., China), triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate salt (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A.), 2-methylimidazole (Sigma Aldrich, USA), and<lb/> barium hydroxide monohydrate (Ba(OH) 2 ⋅H 2 O, Sigma Aldrich, USA) were used without any further purification.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.2. Synthesis of cycloaliphatic epoxy-phenyl-based siloxane hybrid resin (EPSR)<lb/></head>

			<p>A Cycloaliphatic epoxy-phenyl siloxane matrix resin (EPSR) was synthesized by a nonhydrolytic sol-gel condensation reaction<lb/> following previously reported methods <ref type="biblio">[5,16]</ref>. ECTS and DPSD (molar ratio of 1:1) were blended in a two-neck flask using a magnetic<lb/> (or mechanical) stirrer for a few minutes. Next, 0.2 mol% Ba(OH) 2 ⋅H 2 O of total silane precursors was added to promote a<lb/> base-catalyzed sol-gel reaction between the ECTS and DPSD. The blended solution was mixed at 80 • C under nitrogen purging for a few<lb/> hours. After mixing, a viscous siloxane resin was obtained.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.3. Fabrication of alumina-incorporated epoxy-based siloxane composites (AP-EPSH)<lb/></head>

			<p>The DOX as an epoxy crosslinker was added to EPSR at a 2:3 M ratio of the epoxy molecule. Triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonate<lb/> salt (for UV-curing) or 2-methylimidazole (for thermal-curing) was added to induce the epoxy ring-opening polymerization at 1 wt% of<lb/> total resin content. Further, APs (SAP and LAP) were added to the mixed resin at a certain concentration (90% of matrix) (the ratio of<lb/> SAP to LAP is varied from 0:10 to 10:0). The final mixed resin was exposed to UV-lamp (240 mJ/s, 10 min) for UV-curing or was stored<lb/> at 120 • C for 5 h for thermal-curing to obtain the cured product (UV-or thermal-cured AP-EPSH) was obtained.<lb/></p>

			<head>2.4. Characterization<lb/></head>

			<p>Thermal properties were examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Q50, TA Instruments, Inc.) at a heating rate of 10 • C/min<lb/> under N 2 atmosphere. Thermomechanical properties were measured by thermomechanical analysis (TMA, EXTAR TMA/SS 6100,<lb/> Seiko Instrument, Inc.) at a heating rate of 10 • C/min. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded with on an FT-IR 680<lb/> plus instrument (JASCO, U.S.A.). 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a DMX600 FT 600-MHz<lb/> spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Australia). Mechanical properties were measured using a universal testing machine (AGS-X STD, Shi-<lb/>madzu, Japan). The dielectric properties of the composites (at 5 Hz) were measured using a microdielectrometer (AET, Japan). The<lb/> surface resistivity of the composites was obtained using an electrometer (6517 B, Keithley, USA) and a resistivity test fixture (8009,<lb/> Keithley, USA). The breakdown strengths of the composites were recorded using a breakdown strength tester (SKY-HAV-1010, SKY<lb/> Innotek, Republic of Korea). The thermal conductivity was determined using a thermal conductivity analyzer (LAF 6720, C-Therm<lb/> Technologies, Canada). The SEM images were obtained using scanning electron microscopy (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan)<lb/></p>

            <head>3. Results and discussion<lb/></head>
            <head>3.1. Fabrication of AP-incorporated epoxy-based siloxane composites<lb/></head>

			<p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref> presents the procedure for synthesizing cycloaliphatic epoxy-phenyl-based siloxane hybrid resin (EPSR) via a non-<lb/>hydrolytic sol-gel reaction between the methoxy group of ECTS and the hydroxyl group of DPSD. Unlike a conventional hydrolytic<lb/> sol-gel reaction, non-hydrolytic sol-gel reactions do not require water for hydrolysis of silane precursors prior to condensation;<lb/> however, siloxane networks can be formed because of the existence of the hydroxyl group (silanol) in DPSD <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref>. The FT-IR spectra<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) shows that the band corresponding to the stretching of the siloxane bond (Si-O-Si) at 1100-1100 cm -1 is considerably<lb/> broadened after the non-hydrolytic sol-gel reaction, indicating the successful formation of siloxane networks, which can be further<lb/></p>

			<p>confirmed by comparing FT-IR spectra of ECTS, DPSD and EPSR. In addition, the organic groups present in the two types of silane<lb/> precursors (epoxy group peak at 882 cm -1 ; and phenyl group peak at 1430 cm -1 ) remained after the sol-gel reaction, indicating that<lb/> they did not decompose during the non-hydrolytic sol-gel reaction. In the sol-gel reaction between ECTS and DPSD, there are two<lb/> reactive functional groups to form siloxane networks in which three methoxy groups and two hydroxyl groups present in ECTS and<lb/> DPSD, respectively, thereby randomly formed siloxane bonds with branched structure can be generated. These can be confirmed in<lb/> FT-IR spectra, where the absorbance intensity at the peak region in 1000-1100 cm -1 is much broaden and no distinct peaks in the<lb/> siloxane bond region. Moreover, synthesized EPSR showed a high degree of siloxane bond formation (~85%) that can be observed in<lb/> the 29 Si-NMR results, supporting the random and branched siloxane bond formation (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Using EPSR, we fabricated AP-incorporated siloxane hybrid-based composites (AP-EPSH) by combining LAPs and SAPs (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>)<lb/></p>

			<p>having average sizes of 2 and 45 μm, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>). The weight ratio of AP to EPSH is 90:10. Keeping the total weight con-<lb/>centration of AP constant, we changed the ratio of LAP to SAP (from 0:10 to 10:0). For complete epoxy curing, the di-oxetane monomer<lb/> (DOX) that acts as an epoxy crosslinker as well as a hardener, was used as the curing agent. Subsequently, after mixing crosslinker<lb/> (DOX) and bimodal sized APs (LAP and SAP) with the matrix, AP-EPSH was fabricated via thermal-or UV-induced cationic epoxy ring-<lb/>opening polymerization <ref type="biblio">[5,16]</ref>. In this process, there are two chemical crosslinking reaction: (I) a chemical reaction between<lb/> epoxy-functional groups in siloxane matrix and (II) a chemical reaction between epoxy-functional group in siloxane matrix and<lb/> oxetane group in DOX. These two chemical crosslinking reactions induce the formation of alumina/epoxy-based siloxane composites<lb/></p>

			<p>with rigid and high crosslinking density <ref type="biblio">[5,22,25]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref> presents the FT-IR spectra before and after the thermal-and UV-induced<lb/> epoxy curing process; the peaks correspond to the epoxy ring at 882 cm -1 was removed completely, indicating that APs did not<lb/> interrupt the epoxy ring-opening process. Therefore, we fabricated successfully cured AP (with two different size)-incorporated<lb/> cycloaliphatic epoxy-phenyl-based siloxane composites.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Morphology and packing density of AP-EPSH<lb/></head>

			<p>The photographs of AP-EPSH for different ratios of SAP to LAP are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S3</ref>, which shows the increased optical haze causes<lb/> by APs incorporation. Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows cross-sectional SEM images of thermal-cured (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>) and UV-cured (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>) AP-EPSH by varying<lb/> the ratio of LAP to SAP, in which all samples according to two different curing mechanism and varying the ratio of LAP to SAP exhibited<lb/> distribution of APs surrounded by the EPSH matrix was confirmed. Especially, UV-cured composites showed more homogeneous<lb/> distribution of APs in EPSH matrix than that of thermal-cured samples.<lb/></p>

			<p>Before the investigation of various physical properties, we confirmed the packing density of composites with two different sized<lb/> filler particles. In conventional particle packing theories, loosening (large particle dominant case) and wall (small particle dominant<lb/> case) effects are considered to obtain the theoretical calculation values of the packing density of power, which exhibit highly reliable<lb/> prediction <ref type="biblio">[27-32]</ref>. The packing density of powder after mixture can be expressed by<lb/></p>

            <formula>ρ =<lb/> ∑ n<lb/> i=1<lb/> ∅ i (i = 1 for small particle, and 2 for large particle)<lb/>

				(<label>1<lb/></label>)

            </formula>

			<p>where ρ and φ i represent the packing density using two different size particles and partial volume fraction of given particles (small or<lb/> large particles), respectively. The fractions of large or small particles are denoted by<lb/></p>

				<formula>ω i =<lb/> ∅ i<lb/> ρ<lb/> ,<lb/>(<label>2</label>)<lb/></formula>



				<formula>∑ n<lb/> i=1<lb/> ω i = 1.<lb/> (<label>3 <lb/></label>)</formula>



			<p>When small particles in the matrix are dominant, the space occupied by large particles can be defined as φ 2 ; therefore, the space<lb/> occupied by small particles is 1 -φ 2 . If there are no interactions between large and small particles, ρ is expressed by<lb/></p>

				<formula>ρ = ∅ 2 + α(1 -∅ 2 ),<lb/>(<label>4<lb/></label>)</formula>

			<p>where α represents the packing density of both particles. When small particles in the matrix are dominant, the ρ of power (denoted by<lb/> ρ 1 ) considering the wall effect is obtained by <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>:<lb/></p>

				<formula>ρ 1 = α 1 + (1 -α 1 )g∅ 2 ,<lb/>

				 (<label>5</label>)<lb/>

				</formula>

			<p>where g represents the wall effect related to the constant determined by g = 1 -r 1 /r 2 , and α 1 represents the packing density of small<lb/> particles <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>. When r 1 /r 2 is closed to zero, small particles are too small to consider the wall effect. To make Eqs. (4) and (<ref type="formula">5</ref>) consistent,<lb/> g equals to 1. When the size of large particles is the same with that of small particles (i.e., r 1 /r 2 = 1), ρ 1 is equal to α 1 because only small<lb/> particles are considered, the g value is zero. When large particles in the matrix are dominant, ρ without the interaction is expressed as<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 3. Changes of packing density of AP-EPSH according to the ratios of LAP to SAP.<lb/></figure>

				<formula>ρ = α 2 + ∅ 1<lb/>(<label>6<lb/></label>)</formula>

			<p>where α 2 represent the packing density of large particles. Considering the loosening effect, the ρ of binary particle system (denoted by<lb/> ρ 2 ) can be obtained from <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>:<lb/></p>

				<formula>ρ 2 = α 2 + f ∅ 1 ,<lb/>

				(<label>7<lb/></label>)
            </formula>

			<p>where f represents the loosening effect-related constant. Parameter f is similar to g in which f = 1 when r 1 /r 2 = 0 and f = 0 when r 1 /r 2 =<lb/> 1.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on packing theories, we calculated the packing density using the various physical parameters of LAP and SAP (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). We<lb/> used specification values from manufacturers and calculated the volumes of two different APs using their average diameters.<lb/> Therefore, the highest packing density of AP-EPSH was obtained when the ratio of LAP to SAP was 8:2.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.3. Thermal properties of AP-EPSH<lb/></head>

			<p>We investigated changes in the thermal conductivity of AP-EPSH by thermal-and UV-curing processes for different ratios of LAP to<lb/> SAP following the incorporation of AP with a high-thermal conductivity filler (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>). By increasing the LAP concentration until 80%<lb/> (LAP:SAP = 8:2), the thermal conductivity of UV-cured AP-EPSH was increased dramatically (from 4.26 to 11.45 W/m K) that is much<lb/> higher than those of thermal-cured composites (from 1.66 to 2.97 W/m K). This is because UV-cured composite retains uniform<lb/> distribution of LAPs and SAPs compared to thermal-cured sample, which induces effective thermal conductive pathways making high<lb/> thermal conductivity. Fig. <ref type="figure">S4</ref> represents schematic illustration of difference of thermal conduction of between thermal-and UV-cured<lb/> composites. On the other hands, thermal-cured composites have large portion of sedimented particle in matrix because the thermal-<lb/>curing process can cause aggregation and/or agglomeration of particles, which inhibits thermal conduction that cause low thermal<lb/> conductivity. This can be also confirmed by previous cross-sectional SEM images of UV-or thermal-cured AP-EPSH (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The<lb/> thermal conductivity values of all AP-EPSH were higher than that of the previous reported epoxy-based siloxane/silica composites<lb/> because of the higher thermal conductivity of AP than that of silica (AP = 30 W/m K, silica = 12-20 W/m K) <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. When LAPs were<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 4. Thermal properties of AP-EPSH according to the ratios of LAP to SAP. a) thermal conductivity, b) coefficient of thermal expansion, TGA<lb/> results of AP-EPSH using c) thermal-curing and d) UV-curing.<lb/></figure>

			<p>further added in AP-EPSH (i.e., LAP:SAP = 10:0), the thermal conductivity values of UV-and thermal-cured AP-EPSH were reduced<lb/> due to decreasing packing density. Although the decreasing thermal conductivity of composites by further added LAPs, UV-cured<lb/> AP-EPSH still exhibited higher than thermal-cured EPSH.<lb/></p>

			<p>We compared the thermomechanical properties of UV-and thermal-cured AP-EPSH by varying the ratio of LAP to SAP (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b and<lb/> S5</ref>). The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) values of AP-EPSH gradually decreased on increasing the LAP portion until the ratio of<lb/> LAP to SAP is 8:2 because of the increasing packing density. The CTE values of UV-and thermal-cured AP-EPSH were increasing when<lb/> LAP was added to 100%, caused by decreasing the packing density. All CTE values of UV-cured AP-EPSH according to varying the ratio<lb/> of LAP to SAP were higher than those of thermal-cured samples because UV-curing process induces uniform distribution of APs making<lb/> effective preventing thermal expansion of composites. We investigated thermal stability by confirming thermal decomposition<lb/> behavior using TGA, which exhibited high five weight percent loss temperature (T d5wt% ) (~380 • C) and residual weight (~90%) that is<lb/> higher than those of bare siloxane matrix and commercial epoxy-based matrix, which are attributed to robust siloxane matrix and<lb/> highly concentrated inorganic fillers <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c and d</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Therefore, we attributed that incorporating APs induces greatly<lb/> enhanced thermal stability and the packing density affected the thermal expansion property. In addition, UV-cured composites<lb/> exhibited much higher thermal conductivity (&gt;11 W/m K) than that of thermal-cured AP-EPSH (~3 W/m K).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.4. Mechanical properties of AP-EPSH<lb/></head>

			<p>We conducted tensile tests for investigating the change in the mechanical properties of thermal-and UV-cured AP-EPSH with<lb/> varying the ratio of LAP to SAP (Fig. <ref type="figure">5 and S6</ref>). In thermal-cured AP-EPSH, with an increase in the concentration of LAP until 80%<lb/> (LAP:SAP = 8:2), the tensile strength value (or facture strength) of AP-EPSH exhibited decreases (from 17.9 MPa to ~10 MPa), while<lb/> elastic modulus of AP-EPSH was gradually increased (from 2.44 GPa to 3.92 GPa) because of mechanical reinforcement by the<lb/> increased packing density and effective reinforcement by small particles (i.e., SAPs) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref> and Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) <ref type="biblio">[32,33]</ref>. The tensile strength<lb/> values increased when LAPs were further increased to 100% (LAP:SAP = 10:0) due to weakening mechanical reinforcement. This can<lb/> be also confirmed by decreased elastic modulus to 3.24 GPa. In case of UV-cured AP-EPSH, tensile strength and elastic modulus were<lb/> significantly increased (tensile strength: from 19.7 MPa to 24.2 MPa; elastic modulus: from 2.99 GPa to 6.30 GPa), which are much<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 5. Tensile stress and elastic modulus values of a) thermal-cured and b) UV-cured AP-EPSH according to the ratios of LAP to SAP.<lb/></figure>

			<p>higher than those of thermal-cured composites because uniform distributed APs by UV-curing processes can make the effective me-<lb/>chanical reinforcement <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>). Changes of elongation with varying the ratios of LAP to SAP also exhibited similar trend, which<lb/> are proof of mechanical reinforcement (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>). Therefore, we can confirm that UV-cured AP-EPSH with uniform distributed APs can<lb/> induce effective mechanical reinforcement compared to thermal-cured AP-EPSH with large sedimented APs. Therefore, we conclude<lb/> that the incorporation of APs with two different sizes enhances the tensile property of composites (i.e., tensile strength and elastic<lb/> modulus) with the decreased elongation. Meanwhile, the UV-cured composites provide effective mechanical reinforcement (i.e., high<lb/> elastic modulus) (Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>3.5. Electrical insulation properties of AP-EPSH<lb/></head>

			<p>Electrical insulation properties, such as electrical resistance, breakdown strength, and dielectric properties are crucial factors for<lb/> using the composites as electronic packaging materials. Therefore, we investigated various insulation properties of thermal-and UV-<lb/>cured AP-EPSH with varying ratios of LAP to SAP (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). The electrical surface resistivity of thermal-cured AP-EPSH with 100% SAP<lb/> was approximately 10 15 Ω cm, which is relatively lower than that of the previously reported siloxane hybrid matrix and is attributed to<lb/></p>

			<p>the incorporation of AP with a high concentration in the matrix <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. By increasing the portion of LAPs, the surface resistivity value (log<lb/> scale) of AP-EPSH was continuously decreased (from 10 14 Ω cm (logscale value: 14.4) to 10 13 Ω cm (logscale value: 13.6) until the 80%<lb/> incorporation of LAP (LAP:SAP = 8:2) caused by the increasing packing density in matrix (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>). However, this value increased when<lb/> only LAPs were added in siloxane hybrid matrix (100% of LAP), and it can be attributed to physical disconnection between LAPs with<lb/> inserted SAPs, causing reduction of electrical conducting pathways. In case of UV-cured AP-EPSH, although similar behavior were able<lb/> to be observed, all values were lower than those of thermal-cured AP-EPSH (from 10 14 Ω cm (logscale value: 14.3) (LAP:SAP = 0:10) to<lb/> 10 12 Ω cm (logscale value: 12.6) (LAP:SAP = 8:2)), which is same reason in previous explained. The electrical breakdown strength<lb/> values of thermal-cured AP-EPSH were increased continuously (from 10.88 kV/mm to 23.22 kV/mm) with the increasing portion of<lb/> LAP until 80% incorporation of LAP (LAP:SAP = 8:2) (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>). Alumina has a relatively low dielectric breakdown strength compared<lb/> to that of siloxane-based hybrid matrix <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. We can improve the breakdown strength of AP by combining it with the siloxane hybrid<lb/> matrix. The breakdown strength of thermal-cured AP-EPSH was significantly decreased to 5.29 kV/mm, which is lower than that of<lb/> AP-EPSH with 100% of SAP when LAPs were further added. This is due to dense particle accumulation by SAPs. For UV-cured<lb/> AP-EPSH, the relatively higher breakdown strength values could be confirmed (from 16.2 kV/mm to 30.68 kV/mm); this indicate<lb/> that the UV-cured siloxane-based matrix makes the effectively enhanced electrical breakdown strength of APs because of effective<lb/> surrounding of APs with matrix. In addition, the stronger bond energy of the siloxane-based backbone in GPSH than that of the single<lb/> carbon bond-based backbone in conventional polymers can be also effectively improved the breakdown strength <ref type="biblio">[25,35]</ref>. Dielectric<lb/> constant values of thermal-cured AP-EPSH were increased continuously (from 5.02 to 6.34) until 80% incorporation of LAP because of<lb/> the high packing characteristics of composite with a high dielectric constant and the generation of continuous interconnection by SAPs<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>). The dielectric loss property of thermal-cured AP-EPSH exhibited a similar trend to the dielectric constant results (from 0.009<lb/> to 0.013), which is attributed to the low dielectric loss property of alumina. The dielectric properties of AP-EPSH with 100% of SAP<lb/> were similar to those of AP-EPSH with 100% of LAP because of the existence of high free volumes that can reduce the dielectric<lb/> constant and relatively lower packing density than the other samples (AP-EPSH (LAP 100%): 5.02/0.009 and AP-EPSH (SAP 100%):<lb/> 5.10/0.012) <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. Although a similar tendency of UV-cured AP-EPSH was also shown in which increased dielectric constant until 80%<lb/> (from 5.91 to 6.14) and re-decreased after 100% of LAP was added, the effect by APs was higher than that of thermal-cured AP-EPSH<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>); higher dielectric constant and lower dielectric loss. This indicates uniform distribution and compact surrounding of APs by<lb/> matrix, which can lead to increase dielectric constant and decrease dielectric loss (Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).<lb/> By combining various experimental results and packing theory, we concluded that reinforcement with APs of two different sizes<lb/> increase packing density (especially, at a LAP-to-SAP ratio of 8:2); this greatly enhances the mechanical and thermal properties.<lb/> However, these induce low surface resistivity and high dielectric constant because of the electrical properties of APs. Furthermore, we<lb/> found that UV-curing process makes uniform distribution of APs and effective reinforcement compared to thermal-curing process,<lb/> which significantly improved various properties. Our approach for fabricating particle-based composites has a great potential for<lb/> future application to electronics packaging and various insulation materials that require high thermal conductivity and mechanical<lb/> robustness.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>In conclusion, we developed AP-incorporated cycloaliphatic epoxy-phenyl-based siloxane hybrid composite (AP-EPSH) to obtain<lb/> high thermal, mechanical, and insulation properties. The sol-gel derived siloxane hybrid matrix with highly condensed robust inor-<lb/>ganic networks was employed. To maximize the packing density of AP-EPSH, bimodal sized APs with high thermal conductivity were<lb/> introduced. We investigated the effect on the various physical properties of AP-EPSH according to curing mechanism (thermal-or UV-<lb/>curing) and varying the ratio of LAP and SAP. The greatly improved thermal conductivity with high thermal stability, enhanced<lb/> mechanical robustness (i.e., increased elastic modulus and decreased elongation) by incorporating bimodal sized APs in the siloxane<lb/> hybrid matrix were obtained, while increased the dielectric properties (dielectric constant and dielectric loss) and decreased the<lb/> surface resistivity were able to be confirmed. The experimental results indicated that all property changes were maximized when the<lb/> ratio of LAP to SAP was 8:2 because of the packing density of AP-EPSH was the highest among the other ratios. This can be explained<lb/> via calculations using the packing theory of composite with two different size filler particles. Furthermore, UV-curing process exhibited<lb/> more effective than thermal-curing process, which is induced by uniform distribution without sedimented and aggregation APs.<lb/> Following these, we obtained superior thermal conductivity (&gt;11 W/m K), high mechanical strength (tensile strength = 24.2 MPa,<lb/> elastic modulus = 6.30 GPa), electrical breakdown strength (30.68 kV/mm), and enhanced thermal stability (T d5wt% = 380 • C, with<lb/> 90% residual weight after test and CTE = 20.23 ppm/K) by using UV-curing process. Therefore, we achieved the trade-off charac-<lb/>teristics of high thermal conductivity with high electrical insulation properties by optimizing composition of composites with high<lb/> packing density. We expect that our approach for fabricating AP-based composite has a significant potential toward high-performance<lb/> electrical packaging and insulation materials that require high thermal conductivity and thermal/mechanical robustness.<lb/></p>
