			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Diarrhoeal disease is a common cause of death in the tropical<lb/> countries and it is the second mostly causing infant deaths<lb/> worldwide. Shigella is one of the well-studied human pathogens<lb/> that cause diarrhoeal disease and dysentery (e.g., shigellosis).<lb/> Among several types of Shigella species, Shigella dysenteriae is<lb/> the most virulent pathogen causing devastating health problems<lb/> in developing countries <ref type="biblio">[1-3]</ref>. Shigella strains are classified into<lb/> four species: Shigella boydii, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella<lb/> flexneri and Shigella sonnei <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. Sometimes, these species are<lb/> also termed as Shigella subgroups A, B, C, and D. Based on the<lb/> O-antigens, the Shigella species are divided into multiple<lb/> serotypes <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. In general, O-antigens of Shigella species are<lb/> acidic in nature because of the presence of acidic constituents<lb/> (e.g., uronic acid, pseudaminic acid etc. or lactic acid, pyruvic<lb/> acid etc.) in their structures <ref type="biblio">[6,7]</ref>. Recently, L&apos;vov et al.<lb/> reported the structure of the O-antigen of Shigella boydii type 9,<lb/> which is a tetrasaccharide repeating unit containing a<lb/> D-glucuronic acid moiety (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Development of effective therapeutics to control the infections<lb/> of drug-resistant bacterial strains is the thrust area in the medi-<lb/>cinal chemistry. Like other bacterial infections, emergence of<lb/> the drug resistant Shigella infections requires development of<lb/> the newer therapeutics than the earlier used anti-shigellosis<lb/> agents <ref type="biblio">[9,10]</ref>. Because of the high antigenic nature of the<lb/> O-antigens, antibodies against the O-specific polysaccharide of<lb/> a particular Shigella strain have the potential to control Shigella<lb/> infections <ref type="biblio">[11-14]</ref>. A number of reports have been cited earlier<lb/> to develop glycoconjugate based therapy to control Shigella<lb/> infections <ref type="biblio">[15-19]</ref>. In order to develop a glycoconjugate based<lb/> therapeutic agent from the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the<lb/> O-antigen of Shigella boydii type 9, it is essential to perform<lb/> several immunochemical studies with the glycoconjugates<lb/> derived from this tetrasaccharide repeating unit. The large quan-<lb/>tity of the tetrasaccharide that is required for this purpose<lb/> cannot be accessible from a natural source. Therefore, chemical<lb/> synthesis is the only option for achieving this in large quantity.<lb/> As a first step towards the preparation of glycoconjugates, we<lb/> report herein a convergent chemical synthesis of the tetra-<lb/>saccharide as its 4-methoxyphenyl glycoside 1 corresponding to<lb/> the O-antigen of Shigella boydii type 9 using a [2 + 2] block<lb/> glycosylation strategy (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Results and Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>The convergent synthesis of the target tetrasaccharide 1 as its<lb/> 4-methoxyphenyl glycoside has been achieved applying a<lb/> number of recently developed elegant reaction methodologies.<lb/> A number of notable features are present in the synthetic<lb/> strategy, which are (a) convergent [2 + 2] block glycosylation;<lb/> (b) application of recently developed environmentally benign<lb/> reaction conditions for protecting group manipulations and<lb/> glycosylations such as, (i) O-acetylation using sulfamic acid<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>, (ii) regioselective ring opening of the benzylidene acetal<lb/> using a combination of triethylsilane and iodine <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>, (iii) direct<lb/> one-pot conversion of O-acetyl group to O-benzyl group <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>,<lb/> (iv) activation of glycosyl trichloroacetimidate and thioglyco-<lb/>side donors by perchloric acid supported on silica<lb/> (HClO 4 -SiO 2 ) <ref type="biblio">[23-26]</ref>, and late stage TEMPO mediated selec-<lb/>tive oxidation <ref type="biblio">[27-29]</ref> of the primary hydroxy group to the<lb/> carboxylic group under phase transfer conditions without<lb/> affecting the secondary hydroxy groups; (c) use of<lb/> 4-methoxyphenyl (PMP) group as anomeric protecting group<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[30,31]</ref>, which can be easily removed under oxidative condi-<lb/>tions for the preparation of glycoconjugate derivatives. The syn-<lb/>thesis of the target tetrasaccharide 1 was achieved by the stereo-<lb/>selective coupling of a D-maltose derived disaccharide deriva-<lb/>tive 2 and a disaccharide thioglycoside derivative 7 followed by<lb/> functional group manipulations of the resulting tetrasaccharide<lb/> derivative 8. For this purpose, suitably functionalized reaction<lb/> intermediates 2, 3, 4 and 7 were prepared from commercially<lb/> available reducing mono-and disaccharides utilizing a series of<lb/> reaction methodologies reported earlier.<lb/></p>

			<p>selective formation of compound 6 was confirmed from its<lb/> spectral analysis (presence of signals at δ 5.35 (br s, H-1 C ), 4.95<lb/> (d, J = 3.6 Hz, H-1 D ) in the 1 H NMR and signals at δ 92.8<lb/> (C-1 D ), 81.0 (C-1 C ) in the 13 C NMR spectrum). Compound 6<lb/> was transformed into disaccharide thioglycoside donor 7 in 91%<lb/> yield under a one-pot deacetylation-benzylation reaction condi-<lb/>tion <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref> (Scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In this case, the thioethyl group acts as an<lb/> orthogonal anomeric protecting group since it acts as a glycosyl<lb/> acceptor in the case of compound 4 whereas compound 7 has<lb/> been used as the glycosyl donor in the next step. Iodonium ion<lb/> promoted stereoselective glycosylation of the disaccharide thio-<lb/>glycoside donor 7 with the disaccharide acceptor 2 in the pres-<lb/>ence of a combination of N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) and<lb/> HClO 4 -SiO 2 <ref type="biblio">[25,26]</ref> furnished tetrasaccharide derivative 8 in<lb/> 82% yield. Stereoselective formation of new α-glycosyl linkage<lb/> in compound 8 was confirmed from the 1D and 2D NMR spec-<lb/>tral analysis (presence of signals at δ 5.34 (d, J = 4.5 Hz, H-1 B ),<lb/> 4.97 (d, J = 3.5 Hz, H-1 D ), 4.95 (d, J = 8.0 Hz, H-1 A ), 4.89 (d,<lb/> J = 2.0 Hz, H-1 C ) in the 1 H NMR and signals at δ 99.7 (C-1 A ),<lb/> 98.8 (C-1 C ), 96.0 (C-1 B ), 93.9 (C-1 D ) in the 13 C NMR spec-<lb/>trum). Because of the presence of the non-participating benzyl-<lb/>oxy group in the C-2 position of the L-rhamnosyl moiety,<lb/> involved in the glycosylation reaction, a minor amount of<lb/> β-glycosyl linked product also formed (~6%) together with the<lb/> desired product 8, which was separated by the column chroma-<lb/>tography. The presence of the α-linkages in compound 8 was<lb/> further confirmed from the J C1-H1 values in the 1 H coupled<lb/> 13 C NMR spectrum of compound 8. Appearance of J C1-H1<lb/> 172.0 Hz, 171.6 Hz, 170.5 Hz and 162.0 Hz values in the<lb/> anomeric region in the 1 H coupled 13 C spectrum unambiguous-<lb/>ly supported the presence of three α-linkages and one β-linkage<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[36-38]</ref> in compound 8. Compound 8 was subjected to a reac-<lb/>tion sequence involving (a) deacetylation using 0.1 M sodium<lb/> methoxide in methanol; (b) TEMPO mediated selective oxi-<lb/>dation <ref type="biblio">[27-29]</ref> of the primary hydroxy group leaving secondary<lb/> hydroxy groups unaffected in a phase transfer reaction condi-<lb/>tion and (c) removal of benzyl groups for cleavage of ethers and<lb/> reduction of the azido group to an amine by hydrogenation over<lb/> 20% Pd(OH) 2 /C followed by N-acetylation to furnish target<lb/> tetrasaccharide 1 as its sodium salt and 4-methoxyphenyl glyco-<lb/>side in 64% yield (Scheme <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Spectroscopic analysis of com-<lb/>pound 1 confirmed its formation (presence of signals at δ 5.20<lb/> (d, J = 3.6 Hz, H-1 B ), 4.93 (br s, H-1 D ), 4.89 (br s, H-1 C ), 4.82<lb/> (d, J = 7.8 Hz, H-1 A ) in the 1 H NMR and signals at δ 103.3<lb/> (C-1 A ), 102.8 (C-1 B ), 102.4 (C-1 C ), 96.7 (C-1 D ) in the<lb/> 13 C NMR spectrum).<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>In conclusion, a convenient synthetic strategy has been de-<lb/>veloped for the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of<lb/> the O-antigen of Shigella boydii type 9 as its 4-methoxyphenyl<lb/> glycoside sodium salt using a [2 + 2] block synthetic strategy.<lb/> Use of a block glycosylation strategy and a late-stage selective<lb/> oxidation of the primary hydroxy group significantly reduced<lb/> the number of protection-deprotection steps. A number of<lb/> modified clean reaction methodologies have been applied for<lb/> the preparation of intermediates. HClO 4 -SiO 2 has been used as<lb/> an effective acid catalyst to activate glycosyl trichloroacetimi-<lb/>date derivative and thioglycoside in combination with NIS<lb/> avoiding the use of moisture sensitive protic acids. All inter-<lb/>mediate steps were high yielding and glycosylation steps were<lb/> stereoselective.<lb/></p>

			<head>Experimental<lb/></head>

			<p>General methods: All reactions were monitored by thin layer<lb/> chromatography over silica gel-coated TLC plates. The spots on<lb/> TLC plates were visualized by warming ceric sulfate (2%<lb/> Ce(SO 4 ) 2 in 2 N H 2 SO 4 )-sprayed plates on a hot plate. Silica<lb/> gel 230-400 mesh was used for column chromatography. 1 H<lb/> and 13 C NMR, DEPT 135, 2D COSY, HMQC and gated 1 H<lb/> coupled 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance<lb/> DRX 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers using CDCl 3 and<lb/> CD 3 OD as solvents and TMS as internal standard unless other-<lb/>wise stated. Chemical shifts are expressed in δ ppm. ESIMS<lb/> were recorded on a Micromass Quattro mass spectrometer.<lb/> Elementary analysis was carried out on Carlo Erba-1108<lb/> analyzer. Optical rotations were measured at 25 °C on a Jasco<lb/> P-2000 polarimeter. Commercially available grades of organic<lb/> solvents of adequate purity are used in all reactions. Silica<lb/> supported perchloric acid (HClO 4 -SiO 2 ) was prepared<lb/> following the earlier report <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>.<lb/></p>
