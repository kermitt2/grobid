			<p>Chagas disease, a vector-borne neglected tropical disease, affects millions of people in Latin<lb/> America <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>. The disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, has no specific treat-<lb/>ment, and there are no vaccines available for a large-scale public health intervention; therefore,<lb/> strategies to control and eliminate Chagas disease have targeted the insect vectors, triatomine<lb/> bugs <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Importantly, transmission of T. cruzi occurs in two main cycles <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. The sylvatic cycle<lb/> involves small wild mammals acting as animal reservoirs and sylvatic bugs bringing the para-<lb/>site into households, infecting humans and domiciliary mammals. The domestic cycle involves<lb/> the colonization of household structures by triatomine bugs and the transmission of the para-<lb/>site to and from humans and domiciliary mammals. However, there are regions where these<lb/> two cycles overlap, and some authors recognize the existence of a peri-urban cycle <ref type="biblio">[4]</ref>. The<lb/> presence of multiple wild mammalian reservoirs makes elimination virtually impossible in the<lb/> sylvatic cycle <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>, but within the domestic cycle dogs are much more accessible reservoirs than<lb/> wild animals to target with One Health interventions for elimination of T. cruzi transmission<lb/> and reduction of Chagas disease in humans <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Triatomine bugs acquire infection through blood meals from mammals that contain infec-<lb/>tive forms of T. cruzi in their bloodstream <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>. By contrast hosts can become infected with T.<lb/> cruzi through several avenues, including congenital and oral, but the most common and<lb/> important is vector-borne transmission <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. Oral transmission through predation of infected<lb/> vectors is thought to be the most frequent mechanism of infection among hosts in the sylvatic<lb/> cycle <ref type="biblio">[9-14]</ref> and many people have been infected orally in focalized outbreaks in Latin Amer-<lb/>ica <ref type="biblio">[9,15]</ref>. The probability of transmission due to oral vector ingestion is estimated to be about<lb/> 1000 times greater than vectorial transmission <ref type="biblio">[16,17]</ref> and T. cruzi parasites in feces outside of<lb/> the bug are viable (infectious) for up to 48 hours (e.g., in fruit juices) <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>. Dogs, important res-<lb/>ervoirs for Chagas disease in the domestic cycle <ref type="biblio">[18-21]</ref>, can occasionally get infected through<lb/> the oral route <ref type="biblio">[22]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Dogs are key reservoirs in the urban and sylvatic cycles of T. cruzi because they are very<lb/> common within households in Latin America <ref type="biblio">[6,23]</ref>, they have longer lifespans compared to<lb/> other important animal reservoirs such as guinea pigs <ref type="biblio">[24,25]</ref>, they act as bridges between<lb/> both cycles <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref>, and dogs tend to have high infection rates, are very infectious, and have high<lb/> rates of contact with both vectors and humans <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. In Latin America, reports on canine sero-<lb/>prevalence in areas where natural infection occurs concentrate between 8-28%, with extremes<lb/> of 1.5% and 83.3% <ref type="biblio">[26-28]</ref>. Infected dogs are also 100 times more likely to infect susceptible<lb/> triatomes than infected adult humans and 12 times more infectious than infected children<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>. In Brazil, Triatoma brasiliensis, one of the primary vectors of T. cruzi, overlaps geographi-<lb/>cally with areas where dogs are important reservoirs of the disease <ref type="biblio">[30,31]</ref>. In addition, Tria-<lb/>toma infestans, one of the primary insect vectors of T. cruzi in South America, shows<lb/> consistent preference for dogs over other domestic animals <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>. The strong preference triato-<lb/>mine vectors have for dogs can be exploited via xenointoxication-a targeted vector control<lb/> strategy where insecticides are administered to peri-domestic and domestic animals (e.g.,<lb/> dogs) to suppress insect infestations. For instance, by targeting dogs with topical insecticides<lb/> (or insecticide impregnated collars), dogs are effectively turned into baited lethal traps <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Interventions on the dog population to eliminate T. cruzi transmission have been evaluated<lb/> for decades. Mathematical models of Chagas disease have shown that removal of infected dogs<lb/> from a household containing infected people could stop disease transmission (excluding rein-<lb/>troduction) <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>, but culling the dog population would be, at the very least, socially unaccept-<lb/>able and hypothesized to have inconclusive results <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Recent experimentation treating dogs<lb/> with oral or topically applied insecticides showed promising efficacy at killing triatomines<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[33-35]</ref>; in particular, fluralaner, a relatively new isoxazoline oral insecticide commonly used<lb/> to prevent tick and flea infestations, proved especially effective in killing bugs when they fed<lb/> on dogs under laboratory conditions <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref> and is being considered for Chagas control programs<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>. As the unit cost for indoor residual insecticide treatment in a rural house is quite high<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[37-40]</ref> and can be met with low levels of community participation <ref type="biblio">[41-44]</ref>, treatment of<lb/> canine reservoirs with insecticide could prove a useful alternative or complementary strategy<lb/> to reduce T. cruzi infection in people. Additionally, due to the scarcity of insecticide for public<lb/> health usage <ref type="biblio">[45]</ref>, treatment of canines with a safe, long-lasting, effective insecticide such as<lb/> fluralaner potentially could prove a valuable tool in the face of pyrethroid shortage <ref type="biblio">[6,33]</ref>.<lb/> However, given that T. cruzi can be easily transmitted orally through the ingestion of triato-<lb/>mines <ref type="biblio">[9,13,15,46-49]</ref>, there is potential for a counterproductive effect: dogs could consume<lb/> the infected bugs killed by the treatment <ref type="biblio">[27,35,50,51]</ref>, increasing infection rates in the dog<lb/> population.<lb/></p>

			<p>Xenointoxication as an intervention for Chagas disease could have unexpected conse-<lb/>quences. The use of fluralaner could potentially reduce T. cruzi transmission by reducing the<lb/> number of infectious bugs; however, it is also possible that the use of fluralaner could increase<lb/> T. cruzi transmission by making infectious bugs killed by treatment more orally available to<lb/> dogs. In this study, we developed a deterministic model of T. cruzi transmission dynamics that<lb/> accounts for both vector-borne transmission and transmission via ingestion of T. cruzi-<lb/>infected triatomines in dog populations. We used the model to investigate the effects the inter-<lb/>vention will have on the prevalence of infections among insects and dogs under a variety of<lb/> epidemiologic scenarios.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<head>Pretreatment model<lb/></head>

			<p>In regions affected by the domestic cycle and high prevalence of disease, prior to the adminis-<lb/>tration of fluralaner treatment, equilibrium prevalence for dogs was 53.68% and for bugs it<lb/> was 54.48% at approximately 10,000 days (27.4 years) (S1 Fig)<ref type="figure">.</ref> In regions affected by the syl-<lb/>vatic cycle and low prevalence of disease, prior to the administration of treatment, equilibrium<lb/> prevalence for dogs was 23.64% and for bugs it was 38.81% at approximately 20,000 days (54.8<lb/> years) (S1 Fig)<ref type="figure">.</ref> As the ratio of bugs to dogs in the population goes from 5-100, population<lb/> dynamics switch from one where the proportion of infected bugs exceeds the proportion of<lb/> infected dogs to the reverse. Pretreatment, the parameter with the largest impact on transmis-<lb/>sion dynamics is dogs&apos; lifespan; in populations where dogs live for � 3 years, there are higher<lb/> rates of overall infection for both bug and dog populations. These parameters and the potential<lb/> xenointoxication interventions (e.g., number of treatments) can be modified in our interactive<lb/> visualization application found at https://jrokh.shinyapps.io/NewExternalBugs/.<lb/></p>

			<head>Treatment model: Domestic Vectors<lb/></head>

			<p>We explored several different aspects of treatment, including the frequency of treatment and<lb/> the length between treatments. A single treatment of fluralaner after population equilibrium<lb/> resulted in a sharp decline of the proportion of infected bugs and a simultaneous increase in<lb/> the proportion of infected dogs immediately after treatment (Fig <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The rise in the proportion<lb/> of infected dogs is followed by a gradual decline and a rise back to equilibrium levels. The<lb/> sharp decline in the proportion of infected bugs also rises back to equilibrium levels. The per-<lb/>centage of bugs consumed by dogs will be a function of both individual dog behavior and<lb/> accessibility, i.e., bugs die in a location that is accessible to the dog; therefore, we varied the<lb/> percentage of dead bugs consumed by dogs. In this simulation, we assumed that dogs con-<lb/>sumed 80% of bugs killed with fluralaner treatment; in simulations with this parameter set to<lb/> 20% and 50%, trends remained the same (<ref type="figure">S2</ref> Fig). As could be expected, if the dogs consumed<lb/> a greater number of the bugs, the initial rise in the proportion of infected dogs is greater, fol-<lb/>lowed by a shallower decline in the days post-treatment (DPT).<lb/></p>

			<p>We examined the effects of administering canine fluralaner treatment once a year for 4-6<lb/> years (Fig <ref type="figure">2A and 2B</ref>). Similar to the effect of single treatment with fluralaner, immediately fol-<lb/>lowing administration, the proportion of infected dogs rises followed by a gradual decline.<lb/> Also, at each successive treatment, there is a corresponding rise in the proportion of infected<lb/> dogs; however, these peaks remain less than pretreatment equilibrium prevalence. Likewise,<lb/> each treatment corresponds to a sharp decline in the proportion of infected bugs; as the treat-<lb/>ment effect wears off, the proportion of infected bugs rises more rapidly than the infected<lb/> dogs, but infection levels still remain less than equilibrium prevalence. Treating every year pre-<lb/>vents the infection prevalence in both dogs and bugs to reach prior equilibrium levels; the<lb/> effect of successive yearly treatment allows for a &quot;stair step&quot; effect, where each peak in dog<lb/> infection prevalence at treatment administration is smaller than the peak prior. We also<lb/> explored setting the triatomine birthrate to zero, allowing the triatomine population to crash<lb/> after xenointoxication treatment. As expected, we found that with no vectors to transmit T.<lb/> cruzi, the proportion of infected dogs declines within years.<lb/></p>

			<p>Manufacturer&apos;s instructions call for oral fluralaner to be given to dogs once every 12 weeks<lb/> (approximately 90 days) <ref type="biblio">[52]</ref>. When fluralaner is given according to this frequency (Fig <ref type="figure">2C<lb/></ref> and 2D), we observe a similar &quot;stair step&quot; effect; there is an initial spike in dog infections, but<lb/> in subsequent treatments these peaks are smoothed out; even after treatment is stopped, the<lb/> proportion of infected dogs continues to trend downwards for a period of time before the<lb/> infection levels begin to climb back towards pretreatment equilibrium levels. Giving treat-<lb/>ments at this frequency also suppressed the infected bug proportion from rising between treat-<lb/>ments. Levels of infection in the bug population remain low for a period of time following the<lb/> last treatment before returning back to pretreatment levels. In these simulations, we assumed<lb/> that dogs consumed 80% of bugs killed with fluralaner treatment; in simulations with this<lb/> parameter set to 20% and 50%, trends remained the same (S3 Fig).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 1. Single fluralaner treatment in a high prevalence region. Proportions of dogs and bugs infected with T. cruzi after single administration of fluralaner<lb/> treatment at equilibrium (27.4 years) in a region of high prevalence of endemic disease and domestic vectors was simulated.<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011115.g001<lb/></figure>

			<p>We examined the effects of treatment on areas with domestic vectors and a low prevalence<lb/> of disease (Fig <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In regions with a low prevalence of disease (m = 15) and dogs average life-<lb/>span = 3 years, fluralaner treatment is marked by the initial increase in prevalence of infected<lb/> dogs (at time of treatment), but -unlike regions with a high prevalence of disease-the infection<lb/> peak does not gradually decline; rather, it forms an elevated plateau followed by a gradual<lb/> decline back to equilibrium infection levels. In regions of low disease prevalence (m = 7) and<lb/> dogs with longer lifespans (average lifespan = 6 years), the initial spike in dog infection preva-<lb/>lence continues to rise for a period of time; with each successive treatment, the proportion of<lb/> infected dogs rises higher than the peak prior (Fig <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). When percentages of dead bugs con-<lb/>sumed by dogs is lower (at 20% and 50% instead of 80%), the level of infected dogs decline<lb/> with fluralaner treatment when dogs have a 3-year life span (S4A-S4C Fig)<ref type="figure">.</ref> When dogs have a<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 2. Multiple fluralaner treatments in a high prevalence region. Treatment scenarios were simulated for equilibrium populations of bugs and dogs in a<lb/> region of high prevalence of endemic disease and domestic vectors. Annual administration of fluralaner for both 4 years (A) and 6 years (B) was simulated, as<lb/> well as administration every 90 days (veterinary recommendation) for one year (C) and for two years (D).<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011115.g002<lb/> 6-year lifespan, infected dog numbers trend up after fluralaner treatment assuming a percent-<lb/>age of 50% as well as 80% but trend down with 20% (S4D-S4F Fig).<lb/></figure>

			<head>Treatment model: Semi-sylvatic vectors<lb/></head>

			<p>We simulated regions with lower disease prevalence and semi-sylvatic vectors for both the<lb/> baseline average dog lifespan (Fig <ref type="figure">4A-4C</ref>) as well as the 6-year life span (Fig 4D<ref type="figure">-4F</ref>). Similar<lb/> to the prior models with low disease prevalence, administration of fluralaner leads to a rise in<lb/> dog infection prevalence, which increases with successive treatments. The effect is particularly<lb/> apparent where dogs have longer lifespans (Fig 4D<ref type="figure">-4F</ref>); although bug infection experiences a<lb/> sharp decline upon treatment administration, with repeated treatments, the bug infection<lb/> prevalence rebounds to levels above the pretreatment equilibrium values. The semi-sylvatic<lb/> low-prevalence model is sensitive to the proportion of bugs eaten with trends being similar to<lb/> those of the non-semi-sylvatic cycle low-prevalence model (S5 Fig).<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>Our models indicate that in regions with high disease prevalence and domestic vectors treat-<lb/>ment of dogs with fluralaner could provide an effective complementary community-level treat-<lb/>ment of T. infestans infestations, similar to what lab experiments suggest <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. In regions with<lb/> high prevalence of household infestations, even if dogs were to consume large numbers of T.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 3. Fluralaner treatment schemes in low prevalence regions. Simulations were conducted to explore the effect of fluralaner treatment of regions of low<lb/> prevalence of endemic disease and domestic vectors in equilibrium; we explored a range of dog average lifespan from 3 years (A-C) to 6 years (D-F). Treatment<lb/> scenarios include one time treatment (A, D), annual treatment for 4 years (B, E), and treatment every 90 days for 1 year (C, F).<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011115.g003<lb/></figure>

			<p>cruzi-infected bugs, our models suggest that levels of canine infection would drop below pre-<lb/>treatment levels following the initial rise due to oral consumption. Even more promising, treat-<lb/>ment appears to be beneficial if given at yearly intervals, which would be more cost-effective,<lb/> and likely have higher community participation rates, than treating every 3 months. As a point<lb/> of comparison, the price of fluralaner for a medium size dog in Peru is 22.20 USD <ref type="biblio">[53]</ref> and the<lb/> minimum wage in the same country is 275 USD/month <ref type="biblio">[54]</ref>. Our model ignored seasonality;<lb/> it could be possible to time yearly treatments leading to a slower resurgence of the vector popu-<lb/>lation the following year, similar to timing of spraying campaigns <ref type="biblio">[55,56]</ref>. The findings of<lb/> these simulations are supported by a placebo controlled before-and-after efficacy trial of flura-<lb/>laner administration to dogs in Chaco Province, Argentina (a region with high prevalence of<lb/> domestic vectors/household infestation); the authors demonstrated that site infestation and<lb/> domicile bug abundance plummeted over the months posttreatment <ref type="biblio">[57]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In contrast, our findings suggest that in regions with low disease prevalence and domestic<lb/> or sylvatic bug populations, especially in regions where dogs have longer lifespans, careful<lb/> attention needs to be given to the potential of unintended consequences of xenointoxication<lb/> on T. cruzi transmission. In these regions, when dogs are able to consume a large percentage<lb/> of the bugs (50% or more based on our sensitivity analysis for 6-year life-spans) our models<lb/> suggest that infection levels in dogs (and in some situations infection in bugs), end up higher<lb/> than pretreatments levels. As the rise in dog infection prevalence occurred either at treatment<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 4. Fluralaner treatment schemes in low prevalence regions with semi-sylvatic transmission. Simulations were conducted to explore the effect of<lb/> fluralaner treatment of regions of low prevalence of endemic disease and domestic vectors as well as semi-sylvatic vectors in equilibrium; we explored a range of<lb/> dog average lifespan from 3 years (A-C) to 6 years (D-F). Treatment scenarios include one time treatment (A, D), annual treatment for 4 years (B, E), and<lb/> treatment every 90 days for 1 year (C, F).<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011115.g004<lb/></figure>

			<p>administration or shortly thereafter, when bug infection prevalence is very low, we can say<lb/> that this expected increase is due to canine consumption of bugs killed by treatment. Whether<lb/> a dog would consume a bug killed by treatment would depend on 1) dog behavior and 2)<lb/> whether the bugs would be able to conceal themselves prior to succumbing to the treatment.<lb/></p>

			<p>It was reported that nearly all the bugs that fed on treated dogs between 4-60 DPT died<lb/> within 24 hours of exposure <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>, and we assumed that dogs consumed 80% of bugs killed by<lb/> treatment and that consumption happened immediately upon death, but we report results<lb/> from 20% and 50% consumption in the supplement. The consequence of relaxing this assump-<lb/>tion, and having the dogs consume a smaller percentage, would reduce the risk of oral infec-<lb/>tion, in some cases making treatment beneficial in regions with lower disease prevalence and<lb/> domestic vectors. Detailed data on the time distribution from bugs feeding on dogs to death<lb/> would improve estimates for the percentage of bugs that dogs would be able to consume. Our<lb/> findings warrant further lab experiments and small field trials before launching large xenoin-<lb/>toxation-based elimination programs. Before utilizing fluralaner in regions with low disease<lb/> prevalence and domestic or sylvatic bug populations, especially in regions where dogs have<lb/> longer lifespans, lab studies could inform how quickly bugs died within 24-hour post feeding<lb/> period to refine the estimates of risk of oral transmission post xenointoxication. Better yet, ran-<lb/>domized controlled field trials could be designed to closely follow treated dogs, conduct con-<lb/>tinuous interim analysis, and include early stopping rules if it turns out that treated dogs are<lb/> becoming infected at rates higher than controls.<lb/></p>

			<p>Current vector control for T. infestans is based on insecticide spray and threatened by the<lb/> emergence of pyrethroid resistant bugs <ref type="biblio">[58]</ref>. Under experimental conditions, fluralaner proved<lb/> efficacious against both pyrethroid susceptible and resistant 5th-stage nymphs <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. In fact,<lb/> between 4-60 DPT, regardless of pyrethroid susceptibility status, almost all bugs were killed<lb/> after feeding on treated dogs; it would not be until 90-120 DPT that cumulative mortality<lb/> declined at a greater rate for susceptible bugs than resistant, and these results were found to<lb/> not be statistically significant <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. We incorporated the data from Laiño et al. on the percent-<lb/>age of bugs killed after feeding on treated dogs for both the 5th-stage susceptible and resistant<lb/> nymphs into the Shiny web application, but the difference in model outcome was negligible,<lb/> regardless of the parameter set.<lb/></p>

			<p>As fluralaner is a relatively new isoxazoline compound, approved for use in the United<lb/> States in 2014 (Food and Drug Administration [FDA], 2014), literature review resulted in no<lb/> information regarding possible fluralaner resistance. Isoxazoline compounds are potent inhib-<lb/>itors of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels (GABACls) <ref type="biblio">[59]</ref>. Previous phar-<lb/>macological profiles regarding cyclodiene resistance in Drosophila spp. demonstrated that<lb/> resistance to cyclodiene conferred broad cross resistance to compounds blocking GABACls<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[60]</ref>; It has been noted that use of novel chloride channel antagonists as insecticides should be<lb/> managed carefully in order to prevent the rapid development of field resistance <ref type="biblio">[60]</ref>. As flura-<lb/>laner has shown promise in regards to vector control in regions where T. infestans have resis-<lb/>tance to pyrethroids <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>, careful consideration should go into planning and implementation<lb/> of community-level canine fluralaner treatment programs to avoid selecting for vectors that<lb/> develop resistance toward isoxazoline compounds.<lb/></p>

			<p>There was some uncertainty inherent in several parameter estimates. Our model, describing<lb/> household T. cruzi transmission dynamics, is sensitive to the parameter m, the ratio of the<lb/> number of vectors feeding on any given host; households with a smaller ratio demonstrated<lb/> unfavorable outcomes with fluralaner treatment when dogs consumed 4 out of 5 of the killed<lb/> bugs. Yet in small households, populations of domestic animals can be unstable, creating<lb/> unpredictable fluctuations in this ratio <ref type="biblio">[61]</ref>. Likewise, our model only assumed one host, dogs;<lb/> in a real-world context, the effectiveness of fluralaner treatment on reducing T. infestans<lb/> infestation would depend in part on the availability of alternative hosts, including humans,<lb/> chickens and untreated dogs <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. Experimental studies reported the majority of fed bugs were<lb/> fully engorged after feeding on fluralaner treated dogs <ref type="biblio">[33,34]</ref>, making it unlikely that flurala-<lb/>ner has a repellent effect which could divert bug feeding towards humans <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Field studies in<lb/> Argentina suggest the fraction of domestic T. infestans with a blood meal on dogs ranging<lb/> upward of 65%, and that the more bugs fed on dogs the less they fed on humans <ref type="biblio">[62]</ref>; it is likely<lb/> that even with alternative hosts available fluralaner could potentially reduce T. cruzi transmis-<lb/>sion in regions with high disease prevalence and household T. infestans infestations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Chagas disease dynamics are complex and vary much geographically. From our results, it is<lb/> clear that the impact of fluralaner on halting T. cruzi transmission depends on a combination<lb/> of parasite prevalence, insect abundance, and type of triatomine vectors (domestic vs. sylvatic<lb/> bugs). We developed a Shiny web application to allow users to alter the transmission and treat-<lb/>ment parameters and examine the results according to local conditions. For our models we<lb/> used the simplifying assumption that dogs have a constant rate of infectiousness and only<lb/> leave the infected compartment through death. But similar to humans, dogs experience acute<lb/> and chronic phases of infection <ref type="biblio">[63]</ref>; it is during the acute phase that parasitemia is highest.<lb/> Taking into account varying reports on the duration of parasitemia <ref type="biblio">(Machado et al., 2001</ref>)<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[63,64]</ref>, the potential for reactivation, and reports of &quot;super-shedders&quot; in other species (guinea<lb/> pigs) <ref type="biblio">[65]</ref>, we countered the assumptions of homogeneity and temporal scales of transmission<lb/> by reducing the probability of transmission between dog and bug from the reported 0.49 <ref type="biblio">[29]<lb/></ref> to 0.28.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our model demonstrates the potential for canine fluralaner treatment to reduce T. cruzi<lb/> transmission in regions with high disease prevalence and domestic vectors; fluralaner treat-<lb/>ment could be used as a complementary, community-level intervention to reduce T. infestans<lb/> populations in infested households and could be done as infrequently as once a year. On the<lb/> other hand, in low endemic regions and regions with sylvatic bugs, canine treatment with flur-<lb/>alaner could potentially increase infection prevalence in both dog and bug populations via<lb/> canine oral consumption of vectors killed by treatment. These simulations, though a simplified<lb/> version of reality, highlight the need for well-designed studies to investigate the conditions<lb/> under which fluralaner xenointoxication, a promising One Health intervention, is an effective<lb/> control strategy against Chagas disease.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/> </head>
			<head>Model construction<lb/></head>

			<p>We conducted a simulation study, using an adaptation of the classic Ross-MacDonald malaria<lb/> model. Oral predation of triatomines is a well-characterized transmission route of T. cruzi <ref type="biblio">[9-<lb/>17,22]</ref>; through simulation we explored the potential effects of transmission of T. cruzi via<lb/> ingestion by dogs of triatomines killed by fluralaner treatment. Laboratory evidence suggests<lb/> that metacyclic trypomastigotes are viable in dead triatomines days after triatomine death <ref type="biblio">[66]</ref>;<lb/> additionally, there are some reports of human infection through contamination of fruit juices<lb/> with dead triatomines <ref type="biblio">[9,11,15,17]</ref>. In our model, we explore scenarios in which we assume<lb/> that dogs consume dead triatomines and that the dead triatomines ingestion shortly after bug<lb/> death (within a few days) results in transmission scenarios similar to oral predation. This<lb/> model included the following simplifying assumptions: the host (dog) population is assumed<lb/> to be homogenous and constant. The vector (bug) population was also assumed to be homoge-<lb/>nous but differed from the classic Ross-MacDonald malaria model <ref type="biblio">[67]</ref> as a vector birth rate<lb/> was incorporated to balance the impact of fluralaner treatment (to avoid having the bug popu-<lb/>lation &quot;crash&quot; shortly after administration of insecticide). For simplicity we parameterized the<lb/> bug population based on data on T. infestans for the domestic cycle and data on T. dimidiata<lb/> for the sylvatic cycle <ref type="biblio">[68]</ref>. We made a number of simplifying assumptions: we ignored vector<lb/> reproductive senescence and seasonality. We assumed that there was no host recovered class<lb/> (despite the possibility of both treatment and natural recovery) and grouped hosts in the acute<lb/> and chronic phases of infection into a single infected class although it is known that hosts are<lb/> more infectious during the acute phase of infection <ref type="biblio">[64,65]</ref>. We further assumed that the only<lb/> way dogs can leave the infected compartment is through death; to account for cyclic parasite-<lb/>mia, the parameter used in the model for transmission probability from dogs to vectors has<lb/> been halved what has been used in prior models (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Lastly, as T. infestans primarily<lb/> exhibits night-feeding behavior to avoid diurnal predators <ref type="biblio">(Schofield, 1985)</ref>, we assumed that<lb/> oral transmission only involves the bugs killed by treatment, i.e., there is no oral transmission<lb/> prior to fluralaner administration. The implications of changing these assumptions are later<lb/> discussed.<lb/></p>

			<head>Pretreatment model<lb/></head>

			<p>The model considers a single species of host (dogs) and a single vector, which represents differ-<lb/>ent species in different scenarios. We do not consider more complex situations with multiple<lb/> vector species. All analyses were carried out in the R software environment <ref type="biblio">[72]</ref> using the dif-<lb/>ferential equation solver deSolve <ref type="biblio">[73]</ref> and Shiny packages <ref type="biblio">[74]</ref>.

			<p>Dogs move from susceptible to infectious at a rate equal to the force of infection (FOI) due<lb/> to vectorial transmission, which is equivalent to the product of the bite rate (a), probability of<lb/> transmission from bugs to dogs via biting (b), the proportion of infected bugs (Y) available,<lb/> and the ratio of the number of vectors depending on any given host (m, ratio of bugs to dogs)<lb/> in the system. Susceptible and infected dogs can leave the population through the background<lb/> death rate, r; as with prior models, no disease induced mortality is assumed for dogs <ref type="biblio">[10,75]</ref>.<lb/> Susceptible bugs (1-Y) become infected (Y) at a rate equal to the FOI for vectors, which is the<lb/> product of the bite rate (a), the probability of transmission from dogs to bugs (c), and the pro-<lb/>portion of infected dogs (X); as a susceptible bug must survive the incubation period of T.<lb/> cruzi to become infectious, the FOI also depends the incubation of the parasite within the<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig 5. Mathematical models of T. cruzi transmission dynamics between dogs and T. infestans in domestic and sylvatic cycles. Dashed lines represent<lb/> transmission events and solid lines represent transition between states. Prior to treatment, only vectorial transmission (blue lines) is considered to transition<lb/> susceptible dogs (1-X) to infectious (X). Susceptible bugs (1-X) are replenished by a logistic birth rate. After administration of fluralaner, there are two<lb/> transmission routes to infect susceptible dogs: vectorial transmission as before (blue line) and oral transmission (yellow line). In the sylvatic cycle, vectorial<lb/> transmission is constant due to exposure to external infectious bugs (MM).<lb/> https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011115.g005<lb/></figure>

			<p>vector (n) and the daily probability of bug mortality (g). As with dogs, susceptible and infected<lb/> bugs leave the population through the background death rate (g). Prior to treatment, transmis-<lb/>sion dynamics between dogs and bug are represented by the system of differential of equations:<lb/> dX, the change in proportion of infected dogs, dY, the change in proportion of infected bugs,<lb/> and dm, the change in the ratio of bugs to dogs in the population (Eqs <ref type="formula">1.1, 1.2, 1.3</ref>, respec-<lb/>tively):<lb/> dX ¼ mabYð1 À XÞ À rX<lb/> ð1:1Þ<lb/> dY ¼ acXðe À gn À YÞ À gY<lb/> ð1:</p>

				<formula>2Þ<lb/> dm ¼ Rm 1 À<lb/> m<lb/> K<lb/> �<lb/> �<lb/> ð1:3Þ<lb/></formula>

			<p>Parameter values (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) were adjusted to fit observed prevalence for regions of high and<lb/> low disease prevalence domestic vectors, and regions with sylvatic vectors. High and low prev-<lb/>alence are used relatively to consider different geographic regions; in our simulations, high<lb/> prevalence areas have a 2.5 times greater carrying capacity of triatomine per dog than that of<lb/> low prevalence. Using the model and parameter values in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, the impact of fluralaner<lb/> treatment on bug and dog transmission dynamics were evaluated over the timescale of<lb/> decades.<lb/></p>

			<head>Treatment model<lb/></head>

			<p>Data reported from Laiño et al. regarding the percentage of bugs killed after feeding on treated<lb/> dogs over time were incorporated into the treatment model <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. We assume that all dogs in a<lb/> household are treated with fluralaner at a dosage in agreement with manufacturer instructions<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[52]</ref>. The percentage of bugs killed after feeding on treated dogs over days post treatment<lb/> (DPT) was plotted and fit to a logistic curve (S6 Fig)<ref type="figure">,</ref> and the asymptote, x-midpoint and scale<lb/> values were extracted at timepoints 4-360 DPT. To examine the effects of treatment on differ-<lb/>ent bug populations, the percentage of killed bugs after feeding on treated dogs were taken<lb/> from data regarding fifth stage pyrethroid-resistant nymphs and fifth stage pyrethroid-suscep-<lb/>tible nymphs <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>; analyses in this paper used the data for 5th-stage pyrethroid susceptible<lb/> nymphs. The values comprising the equation of the logistic curve were incorporated into<lb/> parameter z, the percentage of bugs feeding on treated bugs that are killed at a point in time,<lb/> and the time dependent covariate was incorporated into the model.<lb/></p>

			<p>Treatment was initiated into the model after both the bug and dog populations reached<lb/> equilibrium. To determine these values, the equation for the basic reproductive number of T.<lb/> cruzi was rearranged and solved for X and Y, the values of the proportion of infectious dogs<lb/> and bugs at equilibrium, respectively <ref type="biblio">[61]</ref>. Parameter values for regions with semi-sylvatic<lb/> bugs were calibrated to approximately values reported for T. dimidiata reported in Yucatan,<lb/> Mexico <ref type="biblio">[76]</ref>. Incorporating treatment, the differential equations are altered (Eqs <ref type="formula">2.1, 2.2, 2.3</ref>)<lb/> to reflect the fact that change in proportion of infected dogs is now subjected to an additional<lb/> FOI due to ingestion of dead infected bugs (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Contact between dogs and the dead bugs depends on the availability of dead bugs at a given<lb/> time point; this is the product of the bite rate, a, the percentage of bugs that will die after feed-<lb/>ing on a treated dogs at that given time point, z, the proportion of infected bugs Y, and the<lb/> ratio of bugs to dogs in the population, m. The rate that susceptible dogs become infected via<lb/> oral transmission will depend on the product of azmY, the probability of transmission via bug<lb/> ingestion, k, and percentage of dead bugs consumed, p. The rate at which the ratio of bugs to<lb/> dogs decreases in the population is proportional to the bite rate, and the percentage of bugs<lb/> killed that feed on treated dogs at a given time point (Eq <ref type="formula">2.3</ref>), while the population is replen-<lb/>ished at the rate of the bug logistic birth rate.<lb/></p>

			<p>As all bugs in the previous model are assumed to be subjected to fluralaner treatment, the<lb/> model would not properly represent regions where triatomine vectors include sylvatic bugs.<lb/> To account for external bugs not affected by treatment, a constant was introduced (MM) to<lb/> the FOI for dogs through vectorial transmission (Eq <ref type="formula">3.1</ref>). The constant MM represents sylvatic<lb/> infected bugs that can contribute to the vectorial FOI in dogs but would not contribute to the<lb/> oral FOI if killed by treatment and whose populations would not be reduced if some individu-<lb/>als are killed by fluralaner (Fig <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Values for the constant were derived by running the model<lb/> without treatment and determining their impact on infection prevalence in dogs.<lb/></p>

			<p>We performed sensitivity analyses upon input parameters based on a range of plausible val-<lb/>ues found in the literature (<ref type="figure">S2-S4</ref> Figs). We also created a Shiny web application <ref type="biblio">[74]</ref> to allow<lb/> users to simulate the model in a way that can capture regional variation in multiple parameters<lb/> available at https://jrokh.shinyapps.io/NewExternalBugs/. All analyses were carried out assum-<lb/>ing the dogs consume 80% of the bugs killed by treatment (p = 0.8). We also explored different<lb/> consumption levels from 20% to 80% (S2-S5 Figs). Unless explicitly stated, all models were<lb/> run using the baseline parameter values (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). R code used within the shiny application<lb/> and to run the different simulations overviewed here can be found in S1 Code.</p>
