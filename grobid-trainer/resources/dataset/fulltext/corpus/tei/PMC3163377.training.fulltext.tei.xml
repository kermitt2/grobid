			<p>Management of inflammatory disorders involves a stepwise approach to the use of<lb/> therapeutic agents. Relieving of pain and reduction of inflammation are urgent goals to<lb/> reduce the severity of symptoms. A generally accepted stepwise approach to treat the<lb/> inflammation disorders includes physical therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<lb/> (NSAIDs), disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), corticosteroids and finally,<lb/> immunosuppressive agents <ref type="biblio">[1, 2]</ref>. However, NSAIDs remain among the most widely<lb/> prescribed drugs worldwide; they have been generally considered as inhibitors of<lb/> cyclooxygenases (COXs) <ref type="biblio">[3, 4]</ref>. Most of NSAIDs act by reducing prostaglandin<lb/> biosynthesis through the inhibition of the COX reaction <ref type="biblio">[5]</ref>. Moreover, data have been<lb/> accumulating through the years suggesting that NSAIDs also probably act on other targets<lb/> to counteract pain. In spite of their beneficial action, their activity is associated with<lb/> deleterious side effects, and continuous administration of these drugs leads to<lb/> nephrotoxicity and gastric ulcerations. The therapeutic anti-inflammatory action of NSAIDs<lb/> is produced by inhibition of COX-2, while the unwanted side effects arise from the<lb/> inhibition of COX-1 activity. It is estimated that 25% of patients using NSAIDs experience<lb/> some kind of side effect and about 5% develop serious health consequence (massive GI<lb/> bleed, acute renal failure, etc.). Consequently, extensive research has been directed<lb/> towards improving their pharmacological profile <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Recently, a novel class of selective COX-2 inhibitors has been discovered. Among this<lb/> class, celecoxib (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), the potent and gastrointestinal (GI) safe anti-inflammatory<lb/> agent. It is considered a typical model of sulphonamide-based diarylpyrazole template that<lb/> is known to selectively inhibit COX-2 <ref type="biblio">[7-15]</ref>. Furthermore, several arylpyrazoles are<lb/> available as anti-inflammatory drugs in market such as valdecoxib <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>, rofecoxib <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>,<lb/> etoricoxib <ref type="biblio">[18, 19]</ref>. SC-558, diarylpyrazole derivative (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), was found to be a<lb/> marvelous inhibitor with 1900-fold selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1. In addition, both SC-<lb/>558 and celecoxib were published, co-crystallized with the active site of COX-2, with many<lb/> investigations about their mechanism of action and selectivity to COX-2 <ref type="biblio">[20-22]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In view of the above facts and in continuation of our interest in the synthesis of bioactive<lb/> heterocycles, especially pyrazole derivatives <ref type="biblio">[23-32]</ref>, we report here some di/triaryl-<lb/>pyrazoles having phenylsulphone or carbonitrile moiety (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The anti-inflammatory<lb/> activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated. Moreover, molecular docking<lb/> studies of active compounds were carried out to rationalize their activity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cyclization reaction of hydrazonoyl chlorides 1a-c with 1-phenyl-2-(phenylsulfonyl)-<lb/>ethanone (2) in ethanolic sodium ethoxide solution at room temperature furnished<lb/> 1-(5-phenyl-4-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-aryl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)ethanones<lb/> (6a-c),<lb/> respectively<lb/> (Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The latter pyrazoles were reacted with benzaldehyde or 4-anisaldehyde in<lb/> ethanol containing 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide at room temperature to afford<lb/> chalcones 7a-f. The IR spectra of the latter chalcones showed, in each case, the<lb/> appearance of absorption band in the region 1640-1676 cm -1 corresponding to the<lb/> carbonyl function. Their 1 H NMR spectra showed the disappearance of COCH 3 protons<lb/> signal and displayed the signals of olefinic protons in the aromatic region.<lb/></p>

			<p>Similarly, the reaction of 3-acetyl-(1-aryl)-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonitriles (10a-c)<lb/> with benzaldehyde or 4-anisaldehyde, under the same reaction conditions for synthesis of<lb/> 7a-f, afforded the corresponding chalcones 11a-f, respectively (Scheme <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The structure<lb/> of the latter chalcones was confirmed under the basis of their spectral data. For example,<lb/> their IR spectra revealed the appearance of absorption band in the region 1662-1668 cm -1<lb/> due to the carbonyl group in addition to the appearance of sharp absorption peak of<lb/> carbonitrile function around 2235 cm -1 and their mass spectra showed, in each case, a<lb/> peak corresponding to their molecular ion.<lb/></p>

			<head>Anti-inflammatory activity<lb/></head>

			<p>The anti-inflammatory effect of tested compounds, meloxicam and indomethacin, on<lb/> carrageenan-induced edema at 3 and 6h, is depicted in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Percent edema<lb/> inhibition (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) was calculated in regard to control group and the potency (%) was<lb/> calculated respect to the indomethacin response. After 3h, the tested compounds 6a-c,<lb/> 7b, 7d, 10a and 11b showed a reasonable decrease in the edema size ranging between<lb/> 30.12% for compound 6c and 105.51% for the most active compound 6b. On the other<lb/> hand, compounds 11c-f showed a weak activity in reduction of edema size after the same<lb/> time (&lt; 27.34 % for 11e) as shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. After 6h, 6b was still the most potent anti-<lb/>inflammatory compound in minimizing the inflammation size with 99.82% activity.<lb/> However, compounds 7a, 7c, 7e, 7f, 10b, 10c and 11a showed no inhibitory effect<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>From the structure activity relationship (SAR) viewpoint, the anti-inflammatory activity of<lb/> phenylsulfonylpyrazoles such as 6a, 6c, 7b and 7d were found to be higher than that of<lb/> carbonitrile pyrazoles except 10a which achieved a greater activity. Additionally, the<lb/> introducing of chalcone moiety to pyrazole ring was found to be variable in effectiveness of<lb/> activity. However, these results imply that the phenyl sulphone moiety and carbonyl group<lb/> attached to the pyrazole system is an essential pharmacophore responsible for activity.<lb/> Furthermore, changing the position of 4-methyl substituent of N-phenyl ring in 6c to<lb/> position 3 in 6b increased the activity. On the other hand, the phenylsulphonylpyrazoles<lb/> that contains 4-methoxybenzylidine group, 7b and 7d, showed a higher activity while that<lb/> with benzylidine group, 7a and 7c, have no activity. Taken together, the results of 6a-c and<lb/> 7a-f provide evidence that the structural features of arylidine moieties and changes in the<lb/> N-aryl group significantly affects their anti-inflammatory activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ulcerogenic effects<lb/></head>

			<p>The most active compounds 6b, 7b, 7d and 10a were selected for the<lb/> ulcerogenic study as compared to the reference drugs meloxicam and<lb/> indomethacin <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. Compound 6b showed lower ulceration (1.5) respect to meloxicam<lb/> (1.67) or to indomethacin (3.17) while compounds 7b, and 7d recorded ulcer<lb/> index higher than meloxicam but still lower than indomethacin; compound<lb/> 10a showed the highest ulcer index (2.83) (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Molecular docking<lb/></head>

			<p>The docking runs were conducted using Molsoft ICM-pro software to rationalize the<lb/> obtained biological results. Besides, the molecular docking studies helped in<lb/> understanding the various interactions between the ligand and enzyme active sites. An<lb/> automated docking study was carried out using the crystal structure of COX-2 (pdb ID:<lb/> 1CX2) in which SC-558 co-crystallized as a ligand <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Both enzymes were submitted to<lb/> regularization process to fit the protein model with the ideal covalent geometry of residues<lb/> to the atom positions of a target PDB structure <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. The regularized protein was used in<lb/> determination of the important amino acids in ligand binding pocket (LBP) of COX-2<lb/> enzyme.<lb/></p>

			<p>Re-docking of the SC-558 was done to investigate its interaction with active site of COX-2<lb/> enzyme. Binding mode of SC-558 showed the binding of bromophenyl ring in a<lb/> hydrophobic cavity by Gly526, Leu384, Tyr385, Trp387, Met522, Phe518, Val523 and<lb/> Ser530 interaction (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The trifluoromethyl group was bounded in an adjacent<lb/> pocket by Val116, Tyr355, Leu359 and Leu531. The sulphonamide group extends into a<lb/> relatively polar region and interacts with His90, Arg513, Gln192, Leu352 and Ser353<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[20, 35]</ref>. Interactive docking using Mol table ligand was carried out for all the conformers of<lb/> all of the tested compounds with remarked biological activity to the selected active site of<lb/> COX-2. Each docked compound was assigned by a score according to its fitting to LBP<lb/> and its binding mode with different amino acid residues that have a role in its biological<lb/> activity (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The interaction of 6b with COX-2 active site appeared that, sulphone function and carbonyl<lb/> group were formed a hydrogen bonds with Tyr355, His90 and Arg513 (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). In<lb/> addition, the acetyl group was imbedded in the hydrophobic pocket of Phe518, Ala516,<lb/> Ser353 and Leu352. In addition, the m-methyl substituent in 6b was surrounded by a<lb/> pocket of Gly526, Tyr385 and Trp387.<lb/></p>

Nevertheless, compound 10a showed a deficient of<lb/> sulphonamide binding mode (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Compounds 7b and 7d gave good binding scores<lb/> and binding modes with different amino acids in the receptor of COX-2 respect to their<lb/> biological activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>In conclusion, we described a facile synthesis of poly-functionally pyrazoles. Some of<lb/> synthesized pyrazoles showed a significant anti-inflammatory activity. 1-(5-Phenyl-<lb/>4-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-(3-tolyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)ethanone (6b) possessed a high activity,<lb/> when compared with reference drugs, with lower gastrointestinal (GI) profiles while<lb/> compounds 7b, 7d and 10a have a moderate anti-inflammatory activity. Molecular docking<lb/> study gave us good information about the interaction mode of sulfone-based pyrazoles<lb/> with COX-2 active site. They have the ability to make hydrogen bonds with amino acid<lb/> residues Tyr355, His90 and Arg513 in COX-2 active site.<lb/></p>

Two groups received the reference standards; 12 groups received<lb/> the tested compounds dissolved in DMSO and one group left as negative control group<lb/> which given 0.2 mL DMSO by oral tube. Indomethacin was obtained from Nile Company<lb/> for Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Industries, Cairo, Egypt and meloxicam was obtained<lb/> from Memphis Company for Pharmaceuticals and Chemical Industries, Cairo, Egypt. The<lb/> tested compounds and meloxicam were given by oral route at doses of 10 mg/kg body<lb/> weight while indomethacin was given by oral rout at 5 mg/kg body weight. This dose of<lb/> indomethacin was considered as a positive control for experiments with any new chemical<lb/> entity <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>. Then, sublunary of 0.1 mL of 2% carrageenan sodium (Sigma, USA) was<lb/> injected in the right hind paw. The volume of the paw was measured immediately after<lb/> injection and after administration of the compounds at time intervals 3 and 6 h by using<lb/> Dial micrometer model (120-1206) Baty, Sussex, England). The results were expressed as<lb/> volume of edema at each time interval, percentage inhibition of edema volume at each<lb/> time with respect to control and potency which was calculated compared to indomethacin.<lb/></p>

			<head>Ulcerogenic effects<lb/></head>

			<p>Ulcerogenic activity of meloxicam, indomethacin and tested compounds were studied in<lb/> Albino rats of wistar strain weighing 150-200 g of either sex and divided into seven groups<lb/> each of six animals. The first group served as control group treated with 0.2 mL DMSO.<lb/> Indomethacin was given by a dose of 5 mg/kg/day while the dose of meloxicam and other<lb/> tested compounds was 10 mg/kg/day. All groups were treated for three consecutive days<lb/> by oral tube. During three days of dosage treatment, the animals were starved for 18 h but<lb/> water was provided ad libitum. Food was allowed 2 hours post administration of the drugs.<lb/> Two hours following the last doses, rats were sacrificed. The stomach of each rat were<lb/> removed, opened along the greater curvature, rinsed with 0.9% sodium chloride (isotonic<lb/> solution) and stretched by pins on a cork board. The lesions in gastric mucosa were<lb/> determined by using stereoscopic microscope. Hemorrhagic lesions were evaluated by<lb/> scores: 0.0, Normal (no injury, bleeding and latent injury); 0.5, Latent injury or widespread<lb/> bleeding; 1.0, Slight injury (2 to 3 dotted lines); 2.0, Severe injury (5-6 dotted injuries); 3.0,<lb/> Very severe injury (several continuous lined injuries) and 4.0, Widespread lined injury or<lb/> widened injury <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistics<lb/></head>

			<p>In anti-inflammatory study, data are expressed as value ± SEM. Results of carrageenan-<lb/>induced paw edema experiments are also expressed as percentage of change from<lb/> control (pre-drug) values. Differences between vehicle control and treatment groups were<lb/> tested using one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni&apos;s test. In<lb/> ulcerogenic study, Data are presented as mean ± SD and were subjected to one way<lb/> ANOVA, followed by multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni&apos;s test.</p>
