			<p>Nature is an important resource for the discovery of anticancer drugs. The relevance of the<lb/> marine environment as a source of novel anticancer compounds has been validated by<lb/> discovery ca. 2,500 new metabolites with antiproliferative activity.<ref type="biblio">1</ref> Bacteria belonging to<lb/> the order Actinomycetales, commonly known as actinomycetes, have provided nearly 50%<lb/> of the bioactive microbial natural products discovered as of 2002.<ref type="biblio">2</ref> Although most microbial<lb/> small molecule discovery efforts have focused on actinomycetes from terrestrial<lb/> environments, marine-derived actinomycetes are proving to be an important resource that<lb/> has led to the discovery of biologically active molecules with unique chemical structures.<ref type="biblio">3<lb/></ref> Excellent examples are the salinosporamides<ref type="biblio">4a</ref> and marinomycins.<ref type="biblio">4b</ref> Salinosporamide A,<lb/> isolated from Salinispora tropica, is a potent 20S proteasome inhibitor that recently<lb/> completed phase I clinical trials for treatment of solid tumors, lymphomas, and multiple<lb/> myeloma. The marinomycins isolated from a &quot;Marinispora&quot; sp. showed significant<lb/> antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and selective cancer cell<lb/> cytotoxicity against melanoma cell lines.<ref type="biblio">4b</ref><lb/></p>

			<p>As part of a program to explore marine bacterial metabolites as inhibitors of tumor initiation<lb/> and promotion, we have targeted nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), a transcription factor that<lb/> regulates the expression of more than 400 different genes. NFκB is an inducible, well-<lb/>characterized protein, responsible for the regulation of complex phenomena, with a pivotal<lb/> role in controlling cell signaling.<ref type="biblio">5</ref> Many genes activated by NFκB encode proteins that are<lb/> involved in tumorigenesis, including cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and matrix metalloproteinase<lb/> (MMP)-9, adhesion molecules, chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide<lb/> synthase (iNOS), and antiapoptosis proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl.<ref type="biblio">6</ref> Constitutive expression of<lb/> NFκB is a frequent occurrence in tumor cells, and inhibitors of NFκB have the potential of<lb/> suppressing carcinogenesis.<ref type="biblio">7</ref> Since NFκB represents an important and attractive therapeutic<lb/> target for drugs to treat many disorders, including arthritis, asthma, auto-immune diseases,<lb/> as well as different types of cancer, it has become a focal point for drug discovery from<lb/> different sources, including the marine environment. Over the last decade, several<lb/> compounds have been discovered that selectively interfere with the NFκB pathway.<lb/> Examples include phenols and polyphenols (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, caffeic acid<lb/> phenethyl ester, quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate), lignans, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes,<lb/> and triterpenes.<ref type="biblio">8</ref> The majority of these compounds are antioxidants, which act by blocking<lb/> the protein kinase-mediated IκB degradation thereby preventing NFκB activation.<lb/></p>

			<p>An additional strategy for protecting cells from cancer initiation involves decreasing<lb/> metabolic enzymes responsible for generating reactive species (phase I enzymes) while<lb/> increasing phase II enzymes that can deactivate radicals and electrophiles known to<lb/> intercede in normal cellular processes. Reduction of electrophilic quinones by quinone<lb/> reductase (QR) is an important detoxification pathway, and induction of this enzyme often<lb/> correlates with induction of other phase II enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase. Based<lb/> on the evaluation of approximately 3,800 marine organism extracts, the percentage<lb/> characterized as &quot;active&quot; QR activators was established in the range of 17% of the total.<lb/> About 60 QR inducers have been isolated from a diversity of sources, and substantial<lb/> molecular diversity has been observed. These active compounds comprise ceramides,<lb/> terpenoids, withanolides, flavonoids, chalcones, alkaloids, and diarylheptanoids.<ref type="biblio">8</ref><lb/></p>

			<p>As part of our collaborative program to define new modulators of NFκB and QR, the<lb/> marine-derived actinomycete strain CNS-653, isolated from a marine sediment sample<lb/> collected from the Beqa Lagoon, Fiji, was evaluated. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene<lb/> sequence places this strain within the genus Nocardiopsis (GQ374440). Strain CNS-653<lb/> shares a nearly identical (99.8%) 16S sequence with another marine-derived strain,<lb/> CNR-712 (EF392847), which produces the modified peptides lucentamycins A-D, and was<lb/> isolated from a marine sediment sample collected in the Bahamas.<ref type="biblio">9</ref> LCMS analysis of a<lb/> whole culture extract of this strain revealed peaks illustrating the characteristic MS isotopic<lb/> patterns of dichlorinated secondary metabolites ([M+H] + :[M+H+2] + :[M+H+4] + = 10:6:1).<lb/> Fractionation of a 30 L culture extract of this strain by standard silica column<lb/> chromatography, followed by reversed-phase HPLC separation, yielded fijiolides A (1, 31.0<lb/> mg) and B (2, 3.0 mg) as colorless non-crystalline solids. Herein, we report details of the<lb/> isolation and structure elucidation of fijiolides A and B, and their effects on TNF-α induced<lb/> NFκB activity and QR induction.<lb/></p>

			<p>The molecular formula of 1 was deduced as C 34 H 39 Cl 2 N 2 O 10 , based on analysis of<lb/> HRESIMS data (a pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 705.1997 [M+H] + ) and on interpretation<lb/> of 13 C NMR data. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 1 displayed ortho-coupled aromatic protons<lb/> [δ H 7.08 (d, J = 8.0 Hz), 6.64 (d, J = 8.0 Hz)], meta-coupled aromatic protons [δ H 6.52 (d, J<lb/> = 2.0 Hz), 5.98 (d, J = 2.0 Hz)], three olefinic protons [δ H 6.76 (d, J = 2.1 Hz), 6.65 (dd, J =<lb/> 5.3, 2.1 Hz), 6.62 (d, J = 5.3 Hz)], and three downfield methine protons [δ H 5.87 (s), 4.66<lb/> (dd, J = 11.0, 4.0 Hz), 4.61 (ddd, J = 13.4, 13.4, 3.8 Hz)]. The 1 H NMR and 13C NMR<lb/> spectra also revealed two N-methyl groups [δ H 2.79 (δ C 44.4 and 42.9)], three methyl<lb/> singlets [δ H 1.46 (δ C 20.6), δ H 1.43 (δ C 31.5), δ H 1.70 (δ C 22.6)], and six exchangeable<lb/> protons [(4-OH, 2-NH); δ H 9.09, 8.45, 8.41, 5.86, 5.73, 4.95]. Interpretation of 2D NMR<lb/> spectoscopic data allowed three partial structures to be constructed: a<lb/> benzodihydropentalene, a 3′-chloro-5′-hydroxy-β-tyrosine, and an aminosugar unit. COSY<lb/> NMR data, including crosspeaks from H-11 (δ H 6.65, dd, J = 5.3, 2.1 Hz) to H-10 (δ H 6.62,<lb/> d, J = 5.3 Hz) and H-12 (δ H 6.76, d, J = 2.1 Hz), along with the 1D proton coupling<lb/> constants of these three protons, indicated that they belonged to a cyclopentadienyl spin<lb/> system. The presence of ortho-coupled aromatic protons [H-5 (δ H 6.64, d, J = 8.0 Hz) and<lb/> H-6 (δ H 7.08, d, J = 8.0 Hz)] indicated a 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrasubstituted benzene ring. The<lb/> connection between the cyclopentadienyl moiety and the 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrasubstituted benzene<lb/> ring was established by long-range HMBC correlations observed from H-12 (δ H 6.76) to<lb/> C-1 (δ C 148.8), C-2 (δ C 135.7), C-9 (δ C 99.8), and C-10 (δ C 135.5); from H-8 (δ H 5.87) to<lb/> C-1 (δ C 148.8), C-2 (δ C 135.7), C-6 (δ C 125.3), C-7 (δ C 147.7), C-9 (δ C 99.8), and C-10 (δ C<lb/> 135.5); and from H-6 (δ H 7.08) to C-2 (δ C 135.7), C-7 (δ C 147.7), and C-8 (δ C 83.2). The<lb/> oxygenated methine proton H-13 (δ H 4.66), which was coupled to the methylene protons<lb/> H 2 -14 (δ H 4.23, and δ H 3.64), also displayed long-range HMBC correlations to carbons C-3<lb/> (δ C 126.7), C-4 (δ C 139.3), and C-5 (δ C 129.1). These data allowed construction of the<lb/> benzodihydropentalene unit in 1 (C-1 to C-12).<lb/> </p>
				
			<p>The 3′-chloro-5′-hydroxy-β-tyrosine amino acid component was established by the<lb/> observation of COSY NMR crosspeaks between a downfield methine proton H-17 (δ H 4.61)<lb/> and the methylene protons H 2 -16 (δ H 2.57, and δH 2.07)]. In addition, these assignments<lb/> were also confirmed by long-range HMBC NMR correlations from H-17 to C-15 (δ C 170.0),<lb/> C-18 (δ C 138.8), C-19 (δ C 114.2), C-23 (δ C 113.9), and C-24 (δ C 168.4), and from the<lb/> phenol proton 22-OH (δ H 8.45) to C-21 (δ C 138.3), C-22 (δ C 151.0), and C-23 (δ C 113.9).<lb/> The connection between C-8 and C-21 was established by a three-bond HMBC correlation<lb/> from H-8 (δ H 5.87) to C-21 (δ C 138.3).<lb/></p>

			<p>The 4-deoxy-4-dimethylamino-5,5-dimethyl-ribopyranose sugar was constructed based upon<lb/> analysis of COSY and HMBC NMR spectroscopic data. COSY NMR correlations permitted<lb/> construction of the spin system from the anomeric proton H-1′ through H-4′ [H1′ (δ H 4.45,<lb/> d, J = 8.0 Hz)-H-2′ (δ H 2.92, dd, J = 8.0, 3.4 Hz)-H-3′ (δ H 4.06, d, J = 8.0, 3.4 Hz)-H-4′<lb/> (δ H 2.98)] of the aminosugar. Long-range HMBC correlations from the N-dimethyl protons<lb/> (δ H 2.79) to C-4′ (δ C 69.6) and from the dimethyl protons (δ H 1.46, 1.43) to C-4′ (δ C 69.6),<lb/> and C-5′ (δ C 75.0) allowed placement of these protons at C-4′ and C-5′, respectively. A<lb/> long-range HMBC correlation from the anomeric proton H-1′ (δ H 4.45) to C-9 (δ C 99.8)<lb/> provided evidence for placing the sugar at C-9. The three-bond HMBC correlations from the<lb/> methylene protons H-14 (δ H 4.23, 3.64) to the carbonyl carbon C-15 (δ C 170.0) and from the<lb/> methine proton H-17 (δ H 4.61) to the carbonyl carbon C-24 (δ C 168.4) permitted the ester<lb/> linkage between C-14 and C-15, and the amide linkage between C-17 and C-24,<lb/> respectively. Lastly, placement of the chlorine at C-3 completed the structure assignment of<lb/> 1.<lb/></p>

			<p>The molecular formula of 2 was assigned as C 32 H 36<lb/> 35 Cl 2 N 2 O 9 , based upon the<lb/> pseudomolecular ion peak at m/z 663.1871 [M+H] + observed in the HRESIMS spectrum.<lb/> The 1 H NMR spectrum of 2 was almost identical to that of 1 except for an up-field shifted<lb/> methine proton H-17 (δ H 4.09) and the absence of one methyl singlet. This difference<lb/> indicated 2 possessed a primary amine at C-17 instead of an acetamide group. Interpretation<lb/> of 2D COSY, HSQC, and HMBC NMR spectroscopic data allowed the planar structure of 2<lb/> to be assigned as shown.<lb/></p>

			<p>The relative and absolute configurations of 1 and 2 were determined by analysis of CD<lb/> spectroscopic data, application of the advanced Mosher&apos;s method, and by combined<lb/> spectroscopic methods. Fijiolides A (1) and B (2) were assigned identical absolute<lb/> configurations based upon the virtually identical CD curves observed for these two<lb/> metabolites (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The relative configuration of the ribopyranose ring of 1 was determined by analysis of<lb/> vicinal coupling constants and by analysis of NOESY spectroscopic data. The magnitude of<lb/> the 1 J CH coupling constant for the anomeric proton (H-1′, 162 Hz) indicated that this center<lb/> possesses a β-configuration.<ref type="biblio">10</ref> A large diaxial coupling constant (8.0 Hz) between H-1′ and<lb/> H-2′ indicated an axial configuration for H-2′, while a small vicinal coupling constant (3.4<lb/> Hz) between H-2′ and H-3′ and strong NOESY correlations between H-2′ and H-3′ and<lb/> between H-3′ and H-4′ established that H-2′ and H-3′ are in the equatorial and axial<lb/> positions, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Determination of the absolute configuration of the<lb/> ribopyranose of 1 was achieved using the advanced Mosher method involving NMR<lb/> analysis of MTPA ester pairs produced by derivatization with (R)-and (S)-MTPACl (α-<lb/>methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl) phenylacetyl chloride).<ref type="biblio">11</ref> Calculation of Δδ S-R values of bis-<lb/>MTPA esters (3a/b) clearly established the absolute configuration of C-2′ as R and allowed<lb/> the absolute configuration of the ribopyranose to be assigned as 1′S, 2′R, 3′R, 4′S (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The absolute configurations at C-17 and C-13 in 1 and 2 were determined as S and R,<lb/> respectively, also by the application of the advanced Mosher&apos;s method. Treatment of 2 in<lb/> pyridine R-(-)-MTPA-Cl and (S)-(+)-MTPA-Cl yielded the MTPA amides 4a and 4b.<lb/> Positive Δδ S-R values for H-19 and H-23, and negative Δδ S-R values for H 2 -16 allowed the<lb/> absolute configuration of C-17 to be assigned as S (Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). To assign the absolute<lb/> configurations at C-13, the 1, 2-diol groups of the ribopyranose in 1 were first protected by<lb/> conversion to the acetonide 5 using 2,2-dimethoxypropane and pyridinium p-toluenesulfate<lb/> in methanol (Scheme <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Treatment of 5 in pyridine with R-MTPA-Cl and S-MTPA-Cl<lb/> yielded the S-MTPA ester 6a and R-MTPA ester 6b, respectively. Calculation of Δδ S-R<lb/> values of MTPA esters of 6a/b established the absolute configuration of C-13 as R (Figure<lb/> <ref type="figure">3c</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The absolute configurations of the remaining components of 1 were determined by<lb/> interpretation of NOESY NMR correlations. A NOESY correlation between H-8 (δ H 5.87)<lb/> and the anomeric proton H-1′ (δ H 4.45) of the ribopyranose suggested a trans-orientation of<lb/> the C-9 glycoside and C-8 ether bonds.<ref type="biblio">12</ref> There were the only two possible stereoisomers,<lb/> (8R, 9R) or (8S, 9S), for fijiolides as shown in Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>. A NOESY correlation between<lb/> H-12 and 22-OH revealed that ester and ether linkages between the two aromatic rings of 1<lb/> restrict free rotation of the β-tyrosine moiety in fijiolides (Figure <ref type="figure">4a/b</ref>). The strong NOESY<lb/> correlations, between H-5 and H-13, and between H-17 and H-23, suggeste that C-8 and C-9<lb/> could be assigned R, and R configurations, respectively (Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref>).<ref type="biblio">13</ref><lb/></p>

			<p>The chloro-cyclopenta[a]indene carbon skeleton of the fijiolides resembles that of the<lb/> cyanosporasides<ref type="biblio">14a</ref> and sporolides,<ref type="biblio">14b</ref> isolated from strains of the marine actinomycete<lb/> genus Salinispora (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Both cyanosporasides A and B (7/8) and sporolides A and B<lb/> (9/10) are equally represented in the respective fermentation extracts of the producing<lb/> strains. This is what would be expected for the cycloaromatization of the enediyne<lb/> precursors to Bergman diradical intermediates followed by nonspecific quenching with<lb/> hydrogen<ref type="biblio">15a</ref> or chloride, a process that has been experimentally verified.<ref type="biblio">15b</ref> Interestingly,<lb/> chloride addition occurred primarily at the C-3 position in fijiolides A and B. Energy<lb/> minimized modeling of fijiolides revealed that C-6 in the benzene ring is in closer proximity<lb/> to the chlorine atom of β-tyrosine than C-3 is to the 22-OH group of β-tyrosine (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>).<lb/> The ribopyranose is also located near C-6 in the fijiolides, further restricting chloride<lb/> addition to that site.<lb/></p>

			<p>With the exception of the chlorine substituents, the fijiolides are nearly identical to the<lb/> aromatization product from the bacterial metabolite C-1027 chromophore (11), derived from<lb/> an antitumor antibiotic enediyne, C-1027 (12), isolated in 1988 by Marunaka et al. from the<lb/> culture broth of Streptomyces globisporus.<ref type="biblio">16</ref> C-1027 is responsible for the activity of the<lb/> complete C-1027 natural product, which consists of an apo-protein with a single polypeptide<lb/> chain of 110 amino acid residues and a chromophore with the nine-membered enediyne and<lb/> benzoxazine moieties. In 1995, Yu et al. demonstrated that loss of the benzoxazine moiety<lb/> in the aromatization product of C-1027 resulted in a substantial decrease of DNA binding<lb/> affinity (~400 fold).<ref type="biblio">17</ref> Fijiolides A and B, which resemble the aromatization product of<lb/> C-1027 chromophore without its benzoxazine moiety, do not display significant activity<lb/> against either HCT-116 or methicillin-resistant Stapyhlococcus aureus (MRSA) (data not<lb/> shown).<lb/></p>

			<p>NFκB plays a central role in a variety of disease states, including cancer. As a transcription<lb/> factor, activated NFκB regulates the expression of numerous genes, which subsequently<lb/> influence cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation.<ref type="biblio">18 , 19</ref> Numerous<lb/> studies demonstrating the effects of different compounds on NFκB activity have been<lb/> reported. However, the results of these studies are often inconsistent, which is likely due to<lb/> the use of diverse cell types and assay methods. For assessment of NFκB activity, we used<lb/> stably transfected 293 human embryonic kidney cells that demonstrated NFκB activation by<lb/> treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, as well as TNF-α. We observed a 5 to<lb/> 15-fold NFκB activation by treatment with 0.14 nM TNF-α, high values for luciferase<lb/> luminescence, and good reproducibility.<ref type="biblio">20</ref> With this assay, fijiolide A inhibited TNF-α<lb/> induced NFκB activity by 70.3%, and dose-dependence demonstrated an IC 50 value of 0.57<lb/> µM. Fijiolide B was less active, showing only 46.5% without a dose-dependent response.<lb/></p>

			<p>An established mechanism of cancer chemoprevention involves the stimulation of metabolic<lb/> detoxification activity. The detoxification enzyme quinone reductase 1 (QR1) is an<lb/> important phase II enzyme (one that deactivates reactive and potentially carcinogenic<lb/> species) which converts quinones to hydroquinones, reducing oxidative cycling.<ref type="biblio">21</ref> The<lb/> enzyme exhibits broad specificity, reducing a wide range of hydrophobic quinones of<lb/> varying structure.<ref type="biblio">22</ref> The induction of QR often coincides with induction of other phase II<lb/> enzymes, and is therefore useful in the study of chemopreventive agents. Hepa 1c1c7<lb/> (mouse hepatoma) cells were used to assess quinone reductase activity via a color change as<lb/> MTT is reduced to a blue formazan.<ref type="biblio">23</ref> Fijiolide A (1) was found to enhance QR1 activity<lb/> with an induction ratio (IR) of 3.5 at 20 µg/mL (28.4 µM). The concentration required to<lb/> double induction (CD) was 1.8 µM (The CD value of 4-bromoflavone, as a positive control,<lb/> is 0.013 µM). Fijiolide B did not demonstrate QR1 induction activity, indicating that<lb/> substitutions on the nitrogen atom affect activity. Differential activity of this type was also<lb/> observed with the NFκB assay.<lb/></p>

			<p>QR1 is well established to undergo transcriptional activation through NFκB signaling<lb/> pathways.<ref type="biblio">24</ref> Although NFκB alone seems to account for only 20-30% of QR promoter<lb/> activity, revealed by mutational analysis, NFκB is responsible for a proportion of the<lb/> immediate response of the QR gene promoter.<ref type="biblio">25</ref> Significant inhibition of luciferase NFκB<lb/> activity and QR activation was detected with fijiolide A at reasonably low concentrations<lb/> (IC 50 for NFκB, 0.57 µM; CD for QR1, 1.8 µM). It is likely that QR activation is NFκB<lb/> independent. In summary, fijiolide A modulates distinct and important mechanisms, and this<lb/> would be worthy of more detailed investigation.<lb/></p>

			<head>General Experimental Procedures<lb/></head>

			<p>The optical rotations were measured using a Rudolph Research Autopol III polarimeter with<lb/> a 10-cm cell. UV spectra were recorded in a Varian Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer<lb/> with a path length of 1 cm and IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 1600 FTIR<lb/> spectrometer. CD spectra were collected in an AVIV model 215 CD spectrometer with a 0.5<lb/> cm long cell. 1 H and 2D NMR spectra data were recorded at 500 or 600 MHz in DMSO-d 6 ,<lb/> CDCl 3 , or methanol-d 4 solution containing Me 4 Si as internal standard on Varian Inova<lb/> spectrometers. 13 C NMR spectra were acquired at 150 MHz on a Varian Inova spectrometer.<lb/> High resolution ESI-TOF mass spectra were provided by The Scripps Research Institute, La<lb/> Jolla, CA or by the mass spectrometry facility at the Department of Chemistry and<lb/> Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA. Low resolution LC/<lb/> MS data were measured using a Hewlett-Packard series 1100 LC/MS system with a<lb/> reversed-phase C 18 column (Phenomenex Luna, 4.6 mm × 100 mm, 5 µm) at a flow rate of<lb/> 0.7 mL/min.<lb/></p>

			<head>Collection and Phylogenetic Analysis of Strain CNS-653<lb/></head>

			<p>The marine-derived actinomycete, strain CNS-653, was isolated from a surf zone sediment<lb/> sample collected near Beqa Island in Beqa Lagoon in Fiji, July 2006. NCBI BLAST analysis<lb/> of the partial 16S rDNA sequence of CNQ-653 (deposited with GenBank as accession<lb/> number GQ374440) indicates that this strain is affiliated with the genus Nocardiopsis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cultivation and Extraction<lb/></head>

			<p>The bacterium (strain CNS-653) was cultured in 30 2.8 L Fernbach flasks each containing 1<lb/> L of a seawater-based medium (10 g starch, 4 g yeast extract, 2 g peptone, 1 g CaCO 3 , 40<lb/> mg Fe 2 (SO 4 ) 3 •4H 2 O, 100 mg KBr) and shaken at 230 rpm at 27 °C. After seven days of<lb/> cultivation, sterilized XAD-16 resin (20 g/L) was added to adsorb the organic products, and<lb/> the culture and resin were shaken at 215 rpm for 2 h. The resin was filtered through<lb/> cheesecloth, washed with deionized water, and eluted with acetone. The acetone was<lb/> removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc<lb/> (3 × 500 mL). The EtOAc-soluble fraction was dried in vacuo to yield 3.5 g of extract.<lb/></p>

			<head>NFκ B Assay<lb/></head>

			<p>Panomics Inc. (Fremont, CA) has established NFκB reporter stable cells in a number of<lb/> popular cell lines suitable for specific applications in the study of NFκB.

Stably transfected cells were seeded into sterile<lb/> 96-well plates at a density of 20 × 10 3 cells per well. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco&apos;s<lb/> modified Eagle&apos;s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10%<lb/> FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. After an<lb/> incubation period of 48 h, the medium was replaced and various concentrations of test<lb/> chemicals (dissolved in PBS) were added. Human recombinant TNF-α (Calbiochem,<lb/> Gibbstown, NJ) was used as an activator (2 ng/mL). Following a 6 h incubation period, the<lb/> medium was discarded and the cells were washed once with PBS. The cells were then lysed<lb/> by adding 50 µL/well (diluted with water 5 times) of Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega,<lb/> Madison, WI), and incubating for 5 min with shaking. The plates were then stored at -80<lb/> °C<lb/> until the luciferase assay was performed using the Luc assay system from Promega.<ref type="biblio">20</ref> The<lb/> gene product, luciferase enzyme, reacts with luciferase substrate, emitting light which was<lb/> detected in a luminometer (LUMIstar Galaxy BMG).
