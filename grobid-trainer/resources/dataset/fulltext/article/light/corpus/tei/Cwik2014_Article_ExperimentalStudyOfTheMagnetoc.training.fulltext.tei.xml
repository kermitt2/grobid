			<p>In recent years, intermetallic compounds RCo 2 (R = rare-<lb/>earth) having the C15 cubic Laves-phase crystal structure<lb/> are the subject of extensive investigations owing interest-<lb/>ing intrinsic magnetic properties of the materials. A large<lb/> magnetocaloric effect (MCE) observed in some of these<lb/> compounds makes them suitable candidates for magnetic<lb/> refrigeration technology <ref type="biblio">[1, 2]</ref>. Materials showing promise<lb/> for magnetic refrigeration applications must exhibit a first-<lb/>order magnetic phase transition <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. In this context, RCo 2<lb/> intermetallic compounds are among the attractive candi-<lb/>dates. According to <ref type="biblio">[4, 5]</ref>, the ferrimagnetic-paramagnetic<lb/> phase transformations in RCo 2 compounds with heavy rare-<lb/>earth elements are first-order transitions, and, thus, these<lb/> compounds exhibit a large magnetic entropy change. The<lb/> magnetic moment at Co atoms in RCo 2 compounds is<lb/> induced by exchange interaction with rare-earth moments<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[6, 7]</ref>. The Co-atom moments in the light rare-earth com-<lb/>pounds range from 0.5 to 0.8 µ B , while the moments<lb/> are almost unchanged (˜1.0 µ B ) for the compounds with<lb/> the heavy rare-earth elements. The induced moments are<lb/> aligned in parallel to the 4f moments in the light rare-earth<lb/> compounds and are antiparallel in the heavy rare-earth com-<lb/>pounds <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>. DyCo 2 , HoCo 2 and ErCo 2 were selected from a<lb/> great number of intermetallic compounds; their Curie tem-<lb/>peratures are 140, 76 and 35 K, respectively <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>. According<lb/> to data of Tishin et al. <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref> for the parent compounds, the<lb/> maximum magnitude T ad at a field change μ 0 H of 10 T<lb/> for DyCo 2 at 141 K, HoCo 2 at 84 K and ErCo 2 at 36 K<lb/> reaches 9.6, 10 and 10.8 K, respectively. The theoretical<lb/> calculations performed by Oliveira suggest that composite<lb/> materials made up of several samples of the doped com-<lb/>pounds R 1-x R x Co 2 (where R, R = rare earth elements)<lb/> can be very useful to work as magnetic refrigerant in the<lb/> intermediate range of temperature, for example 100-200 K<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. The authors have shown that the nature of the magnetic<lb/> phase transformation retains the first-order transition for all<lb/> the pseudobinary compounds. In the present work I want to<lb/> respond to above suggestion and perform the comparative<lb/> analysis of their magnetic and magnetocaloric properties.<lb/></p>

			<head>2 Experimental Details<lb/></head>

			<p>Polycrystalline samples of R 1-x R x Co 2 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) solid<lb/> solutions were prepared by arc-melting using a water-cooled<lb/> copper crucible and a high purity argon atmosphere. The<lb/> high-purity starting materials (Co 99.99 % purity and rare-<lb/>earth metals 99.9 % purity) were taken in stoichiometric<lb/> proportions. The alloys were melted repeatedly (four times)<lb/> to ensure the adequate homogeneity. The mass losses after<lb/> the melting were less than 1 wt %. The buttons obtained<lb/> were wrapped in a tantalum foil, sealed in evacuated quartz<lb/> ampoules, and annealed at 700 o C for four weeks.<lb/></p>

			<p>The crystal structure and the phase purity of the samples<lb/> were determined using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analy-<lb/>sis. Temperature dependences of the DC magnetic suscepti-<lb/>bility were measured at 4.2 -290 K in a static magnetic field<lb/> of 0.03 T using a superconducting quantum interference<lb/> device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design). Magne-<lb/>tization measurements were carried out using a vibration<lb/> sample magnetometer with a step motor in an applied field<lb/> up to maximum 14 T using a Bitter-type magnet. The heat<lb/> capacity was measured using Quantum Design PPMS 14<lb/> Heat Capacity System in a temperature range of 2 -295 K<lb/> without the magnetic field and in a magnetic field of 0.5, 1,<lb/> 1.5 and 2 T.<lb/></p>

			<p>Isothermal magnetic entropy change S H and adiabatic<lb/> temperature change T ad has been estimated using the heat<lb/> capacity data.<lb/></p>

			<head>3 Results and Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>The principal magnetic parameters and crystallographic<lb/> data of investigated samples are collected in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. As<lb/> it seen, all the solid solutions under study are found to<lb/> have the cubic C15 Laves phase, MgCu 2 -type struc-<lb/>ture. The lattice parameters for all R 1-x R x Co 2 compounds<lb/> decreases with increasing R content. For Dy 1-x Ho x Co 2 and<lb/> Dy 1-x Er x Co 2 when a part of Dy atoms is substituted by<lb/> Ho and Er, accordingly, the T C values decreases. Simi-<lb/>larly situation is observed for Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 the added Er<lb/> atoms decreases T C of Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 solid solutions. Mag-<lb/>netization isotherms of all the R 1-x R x Co 2 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5)<lb/> solid solutions were measured at selected temperatures in<lb/> the vicinity of their ordering temperatures in a maximum<lb/> applied magnetic field of 5 T. As an example, the magnetiza-<lb/>tion isotherms measured for Dy 0.6 Ho 0.4 Co 2 at temperatures<lb/> of from 104 to 152 K are illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. It was found<lb/> that, above T C = 113 K, the metamagnetic behavior charac-<lb/>terized by hysteretic transitions in magnetization curves is<lb/> observed. The decrease in the critical field of metamagnetic<lb/> transitions and magnetization jumps occur with increasing<lb/> temperature. The presence of a metamagnetic transition in<lb/> the compounds studied is seen not only in the magnetization<lb/> isotherms but also in the corresponding Belov-Arrott plots<lb/> which are usually used to determine the transition order of<lb/> magnetic materials <ref type="biblio">[12, 13]</ref>. On the one hand, if negative<lb/> slopes or inflection points are found in Belov-Arrott plot<lb/> curves, they often indicate a first-order transition. On the<lb/> other hand, if the Belov-Arrott plot above T C displays an<lb/> almost linear behavior, it implies that a second-order mag-<lb/>netic transition occurs. As an example, the Belov-Arrott<lb/> plots for Ho 0.6 Er 0.4 Co 2 are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The inflection<lb/> point above T C (56 K) suggests the occurrence of a metam-<lb/>agnetic transition from paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic order.<lb/> The S-shape curves in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> indicate a first-order type tran-<lb/>sition in this sample. The same trend is observed for all<lb/> R 1-x R x Co 2 solid solutions with 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.5.<lb/></p>

			<p>According to the metamagnetic behaviour plays a critical<lb/> role in determining the order of a magnetic transition which<lb/> influences directly the magnitude of magnetocaloric effect.<lb/> In order to confirm that present series showed first-order<lb/> transitions, it has used the Inoue-Shimizu s-d model <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>,<lb/> which has been widely used to discuss behavior of several<lb/> types of magnetocaloric materials. In this model, a Landau<lb/> expansion of magnetic free energy up to the sixth power of<lb/> total magnetization M is used :<lb/></p>

				<formula>F =<lb/> 1<lb/> 2<lb/> a (T) M 2 +<lb/> 1<lb/> 4<lb/> b (T) M 4 +<lb/> 1<lb/> 6<lb/> c (T) M 6 + .... - µ 0 MH (<label>1</label>)<lb/></formula>

			<p>The Landau coefficients are accessible through the equation<lb/> of state linking M and the magnetic field :<lb/></p>

				<formula>µ 0 H = a (T) M + b (T) M 3 + c (T) M 5<lb/> (<label>2</label>)<lb/></formula>

			<p>The coefficients a(T), b(T) and c(T) depend on the temper-<lb/>ature with respect to a thermal variation of spin fluctuations<lb/> amplitude and can be determined by fitting the magnetiza-<lb/>tion isothermal data using the above equation. Examination<lb/> of the free energy demonstrates that the parameter a(T) is<lb/> always positive and would get a minimum value at the Curie<lb/> temperature corresponding to a maximum of susceptibility.<lb/> On other hand, the order of magnetic transition is governed<lb/> by the sign of b(T): the 1st order transition takes place<lb/> if b(T C ) &lt; 0, while the 2nd order transition occurs when<lb/> b(T C ) ≥ 0. Besides, c(T) is positive at T C and, in the other<lb/> temperature regions, can be negative or positive. The val-<lb/>ues of Landau&apos;s coefficients are determined by fitting the<lb/> magnetization traces to (<ref type="formula">2</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Accordingly, b(T) is found to be negative for all<lb/> R 1-x R x Co 2 studied indicating the 1st order of magnetic<lb/> transition for entire series. As example, Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the<lb/> temperature dependence of Landau coefficients a(T), b(T)<lb/> and c(T) for Dy 0.5 Ho 0.5 Co 2 compound. As explained, a(T)<lb/> is positive with a minimum at T C , corresponding to a max-<lb/>imum in the susceptibility curve. The b(T) value at T C is<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows the temperature dependences of the spe-<lb/>cific heat of Dy 1-x Er x Co 2 measured in zero magnetic field.<lb/> It can be seen that sharp peaks associated with the first-order<lb/> magnetic phase transitions take place. The Curie temper-<lb/>atures decrease from 140 K for DyCo 2 down to 86 K<lb/> for Dy 0.5 Er 0.5 Co 2 . Moreover, for x = 0.3 and 0.5 in the<lb/> low temperature region (see inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>) additional<lb/> peak is observed. A possible mechanism for the relatively<lb/> small smooth step-like anomaly in C P (T) plots at low tem-<lb/>peratures might be a spin reorientation in the R-electron<lb/> subsystem, which is similar than that observed for HoCo 2<lb/> (T SR = 15 K) and NdCo 2 (T SR = 43 K) <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. It is assumed<lb/></p>

			<p>that the spin reorientation in those two compounds is driven<lb/> by an interplay of molecular and crystal fields, thus, giv-<lb/>ing rise to the change of easy magnetization direction from<lb/> [1 0 0] to [1 1 0] with decreasing temperature. The spin<lb/> reorientation transition was observed in all R 1-x R x Co 2 solid<lb/> solutions and can be understood as an effect of competition<lb/> between the magnetocrystalline anisotropies of the Co and<lb/> R sublattices.<lb/></p>

			<p>It is well known that the heat capacity of metals can<lb/> be considered as the sum of independent electronic, lattice<lb/> (phonon), and magnetic contributions :<lb/></p>

				<formula>C p (T) = C el (T) + C ph (T) + C mag (T)<lb/> (<label>3</label>)<lb/></formula>

			<p>The electronic and phonon contributions to the specific heat<lb/> can be calculated by expression<lb/></p>

			<p>where the first term represents the electronic heat capac-<lb/>ity and the second term corresponds to the phonon Debye<lb/> contribution; γ is the Sommerfeld coefficient, D is the<lb/> Debye temperature, N = 3 is the number of atoms per<lb/> formula unit; R is the universal gas constant; and x ≡<lb/> ω/k B T.<lb/></p>

The inset shows<lb/> low temperature range near spin<lb/> reorientation temperature<lb/></figure>

			<p>The C el+ph (T) dependence for each of the investigated<lb/> R 1-x R x Co 2 compounds was calculated by (<ref type="formula">4</ref>) and as exam-<lb/>ple, the temperature dependences of the heat capacity<lb/> C P (T), the sum of electronic and phonon C el+ph (T) and<lb/> magnetic contributions C mag (T) for the Dy 0.7 Er 0.3 Co 2 com-<lb/>pound measured in zero magnetic field is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>.<lb/> For Dy 0.7 Er 0.3 Co 2 , the best fitting for the wide temper-<lb/>ature range could be obtained by fixing the parameter<lb/> γ˜42 mJ/molK 2 , while the Debye temperature fluctuates<lb/> around 245 K. The values of γ and Debye temperature of<lb/> all R 1-x R x Co 2 with changing composition are presented in<lb/> Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The inset in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows temperature dependences<lb/> of the specific heat of Dy 0.7 Er 0.3 Co 2 measured in magnetic<lb/> fields. It is seen that the maximum of peaks in the C P (T)<lb/> dependences measured in magnetic fields shifts to the high-<lb/>temperature range and gradually decreases with increasing<lb/> magnetic field.<lb/></p>

			<p>The adiabatic temperature change T ad caused by the<lb/> magnetic field change, ie. magnetocaloric effect, can be<lb/> obtained as :<lb/></p>

In the case of Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 , the<lb/> increase is more pronounced and ranges from 4 K (x =0.1)<lb/> to 7 K (x = 0.5). For Dy 1-x Ho x Co 2 , the maximum peak<lb/> value fluctuates within 3-4 K, while for Dy 1-x Er x Co 2˜3 K.<lb/></p>

			<head>4 Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>Comparison of the influence of doping effect in pseudo-<lb/>binary R 1-x R x Co 2 (R, R -rare earth) solid solutions on the<lb/> structure and some physical properties has been studied<lb/> experimentally. It was confirmed that the main phase in all<lb/> solid solutions has the cubic C15 structure. The substitu-<lb/>tion of Ho and Er for Dy in Dy 1-x Ho x Co 2 and Dy 1-x Er x Co 2<lb/> results in the decrease of the ordering temperature. The<lb/> same trend is observed for Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 when Ho is sub-<lb/>stituted by Er. Analysis of magnetic ordering transition<lb/> using the Landau theory and Belov-Arrot plots reveals the<lb/> occurrence of the first-order phase transition in all sample,<lb/> which confirms the theoretical considerations performed by<lb/> Oliveira <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Results of the heat capacity measurements agree well<lb/> with those of magnetic studies and confirm the fact that<lb/> the substitution of R for RR Co 2 decreases the magnetic<lb/> ordering temperature. In addition to changes associated with<lb/> the magnetic transition, the anomalies caused by the mag-<lb/>netic spin reorientation are observed in the curves C(T) and<lb/> χ g (T).<lb/></p>

			<p>It should be noted that the decrease in T C is accompanied<lb/> by increase in magnetocaloric properties in all measured<lb/> solid solutions. Among the presented sample, the best MCE<lb/> was observed for Ho 1-x Er x Co 2 solid solutions.<lb/></p>

			<p>Summarizing, the presented compounds display the<lb/> higher MCE values, which make them candidates for mag-<lb/>netic refrigeration applications in intermediate (50-140 K)<lb/> temperature regions.</p>
