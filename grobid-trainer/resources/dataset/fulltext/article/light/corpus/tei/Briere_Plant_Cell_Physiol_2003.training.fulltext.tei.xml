			<p>LIM proteins have been described as developmental regulators of eukaryotic, predominantly<lb/> multicellular, organisms. Their name is derived from the three transcription factors LIN11<lb/> from Caenorhabditis elegans <ref type="biblio">(Freydt et al., 1990)</ref>, ISL-1 from rat <ref type="biblio">(Karlsson et al., 1990)</ref>, and<lb/> MEC-3 from C. elegans <ref type="biblio">(Way and Chalfie, 1988)</ref>. They are characterized by the presence of<lb/> one to five double zinc finger motifs [C-X2-C-X16-23-H-X2-C]-X2-[C-X2-C-X16-22-C-X2-3-<lb/>C(D,H)] -the LIM-domains – involved in protein-protein interactions <ref type="biblio">(Schmeichel and<lb/> Beckerle, 1994; Dawid et al., 1998)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Based on their LIM-domain structure and organization, LIM proteins fall into four major<lb/> groups <ref type="biblio">(Bach, 2000)</ref>. The LIM homeodomain (LIM-hd) proteins, which contain two LIM<lb/> domains fused to a DNA-binding homeodomain, are exclusively nuclear and act as<lb/> transcription factors. The nuclear LIM-only proteins (LMO), with two LIM domains<lb/> separated by a short spacer and little else, are thought to act as molecular adapter molecules<lb/> and are involved in transcription <ref type="biblio">(Wadman et al., 1997)</ref>. The LIM-kinases, which display two<lb/> N-terminal LIM domains linked to a C-terminal kinase domain, participate in the regulation<lb/> of cytoskeleton dynamics <ref type="biblio">(Arber et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1998)</ref>. The other LIM proteins form<lb/> a structurally and functionally heterogeneous group, which comprises in particular the<lb/> cystein-rich protein (CRP) subfamily.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>To date several LIM-domain proteins have been described in plants including sunflower,<lb/> tobacco and Arabidopsis <ref type="biblio">(Baltz et al., 1992; Mundel et al., 2000; Eliasson et al., 2000;<lb/> Kawaoka et al., 2000)</ref>. They contain two structurally very similar LIM domains separated by<lb/> a longer (40-50 residue) spacer <ref type="biblio">(Eliasson et al., 2000)</ref> and belong to the CRP group of LIM<lb/> proteins. In tobacco, and possibly in all other higher plants, there appear to be two isoforms,<lb/> one (PLIM) specific to pollen grains, and one (WLIM) expressed in all other tissues <ref type="biblio">(Eliasson<lb/> et al., 2000)</ref>. One of the sunflower proteins, HaPLIM1, was detected in the actin-enriched<lb/> germination cones of mature sunflower pollen grains <ref type="biblio">(Baltz et al., 1999)</ref>, while another<lb/> protein, HaWLIM1, was found in all vegetative and reproductive organs where it was<lb/> detected in many cell types and localized either to the cytoplasm, the nucleus or both. The<lb/> protein was often associated with plastids in leaf cells and stem epidermis, as well as with<lb/> small punctate structures in the perinuclear region of meristematic cells of root tips <ref type="biblio">(Mundel<lb/> et al., 2000)</ref>.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>In this paper we report on the fine localization of sunflower LIM-domain proteins in<lb/> sunflower protoplasts. The protoplast model is indeed a simple but useful system for<lb/> investigating developmental patterns and early embryogenesis mechanisms in plants<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Petitprez et al., 1995)</ref>. Our results show that sunflower protoplasts express one of the LIM-<lb/>domain protein genes (HaWLIM1) previously identified in sunflower <ref type="biblio">(Mundel et al., 2000)</ref>. In<lb/> interphase protoplasts, the encoded protein HaWLIM1 exhibits a dual localization, inside the<lb/> nucleus and in the cytoplasm where it colocalizes with cortical microtubules. In dividing<lb/> protoplasts, the cortical labelling is weak and exhibits no specific organization: HaWLIM1<lb/> appears to be localized mainly in the nuclear and/or perinuclear region, at a level modulated<lb/> according to the mitotic stage.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Sunflower protoplasts express only HaWLIM1<lb/></head>

			<p>Three LIM-domain protein genes have been described to date in sunflower: HaWLIM1,<lb/> HaPLIM1 and HaPLIM2 <ref type="biblio">(Baltz et al., 1992; Mundel et al., 2000; Eliasson et al., 2000)</ref>. We<lb/> studied their expression in protoplasts by RT-PCR using primers specific for each of the three<lb/> genes. An amplification product was detected for HaWLIM1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), but not for HaPLIM1<lb/> and HaPLIM2, indicating that only HaWLIM1 is expressed in sunflower protoplasts. The<lb/> amplified HaWLIM1 fragment of 565bp was directly sequenced and found to differ in only<lb/> one position (nucleotide 243) from the previously reported WLIM1 coding sequence <ref type="biblio">(Mundel<lb/> et al., 2000)</ref>; this nucleotide difference, which is most likely due to the different sunflower<lb/> lines used in the respective studies (HA300 vs. EMIL), leads to a one amino acid change (N to<lb/> K at position 81) in the protein.<lb/> </p>
			
			<head level="2">HaWLIM1 protein polyclonal antibodies recognize a 27kDa polypeptide in sunflower<lb/> protoplasts<lb/></head>
			
			<p> Three different polyclonal antibodies were used in western blot experiments to detect<lb/> HaWLIM1 protein in E. coli clones expressing HaWLIM1 and in sunflower protoplasts: an<lb/> antiserum against a GST-WLIM fusion protein, and two affinity purified antibodies (A14 and<lb/> A16) against two synthetic peptides (P14 and P16) from two different regions of HaWLIM1.<lb/></p>

			<p>In bacterial extracts the anti-serum against the GST-WLIM fusion protein recognized at least<lb/> 5 polypeptides, including one of about 50kDa as already described by <ref type="biblio">Mundel et al. (2000)</ref>,<lb/> and one of about 27 kDa (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). The two affinity purified polyclonal antibodies A14 and<lb/> A16 recognized only one polypeptide of 27kDa. In control blots (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, lane 3 and 5), the<lb/> signal was either completely (A14) or partially (A16) extinct by pre-incubating antibodies<lb/> with peptides P14 or P16. This indicates that A14 and A16 antibodies specifically recognize<lb/> the recombinant HaWLIM1 protein.<lb/></p>

			<p>In protoplast extracts anti-GST-WLIM antiserum recognized a 50kDa polypeptide and a<lb/> 27kDa polypeptide as in bacterial extracts, and also other polypeptides (arrow head, Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).<lb/> In contrast A14 and A16 recognized only one 27kDa polypeptide and this signal was<lb/> suppressed by pre-incubating the antibodies with peptides P14 or P16. The specificity of the<lb/> signal was confirmed by comparison with immunoblots incubated with the preimmune serum,<lb/> which recognized no proteins from protoplasts (results not shown). Thus, the three different<lb/> antibodies recognize in sunflower hypocotyl protoplast a 27kDa polypeptide which<lb/> corresponds to the HaWLIM1 protein.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>The antiserum and purified antibodies were also used to perform immunolocalization<lb/> experiments of HaWLIM1 in 1-day-old protoplasts (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Protoplasts incubated with<lb/> antiserum (against the GST-fusion protein or against peptides) exhibited numerous<lb/> fluorescent spots forming a dense network and a nuclear labelling (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a and 3b</ref>). With<lb/> affinity-purified antibodies, a similar labelling pattern was observed. However, with A14 (Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">3c</ref>) fluorescent spots formed a sparse dotted pattern in the cortex and chloroplasts were<lb/> strongly labelled, whereas with A16 (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>) the cortical labelling was intense, displaying<lb/> clear alignments of fluorescent spots, more closely resembling the antiserum labelling pattern.<lb/> The differences observed, in particular between antiserum labelling (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>) and A14<lb/> labelling (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>), may be due to the higher dilution of antiserum (1:2000 against 1:50 for<lb/> antibody) and to a lower concentration of A14 (&lt;8 ng/ml) than that of A16 (63 ng/ml) in the<lb/> antiserum.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>The specificity of the labelling was tested by incubating protoplasts with a preimmune serum<lb/> or with affinity purified antibodies pre-incubated with peptides P14 or P16: in both cases they<lb/> showed only a very weak diffuse fluorescence (Fig. <ref type="figure">3e and 3f</ref>).<lb/></p>
			
			<head level="2">HaWLIM1 labelling in interphase protoplasts<lb/> </head>
			
			<p>Confocal microscopy observations of labelled protoplasts provided more details on the<lb/> localization of HaWLIM1 during interphase. In order to compare the pattern of HaWLIM1<lb/> labelling with that of cytoskeleton networks, 3-day-old protoplasts were double-labelled with<lb/> A14 or A16 antibodies and anti-β-tubulin. In the following we will present examples of<lb/> labelling obtained with A16. Similar results were obtained with A14 and with the whole<lb/> protein-derived antiserum.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the cortex, HaWLIM1 spots were frequently localized along microtubules. There was a<lb/> close similarity between the two patterns of HaWLIM1 and tubulin labelling (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a-f</ref>). This<lb/> can be seen clearly on Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref> where most HaWLIM1 spots are localized on or close to<lb/> labelled cortical microtubules. HaWLIM1 labelling decorated evenly the whole cortical<lb/> microtubule network. A dense punctate labelling pattern was also observed along cytoplasmic<lb/> strands and in the perinuclear region (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d-f</ref>). Quantitative analysis of colocalization<lb/> frequencies calculated on 30 protoplasts revealed that on average 78.6±1.5 % of HaWLIM1<lb/> labelling colocalized with tubulin labelling.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>To provide further evidence of HaWLIM1-microtubule co-localization, 1-day-old protoplasts<lb/> were incubated for 1 hour with 7 µM oryzalin in order to depolymerize microtubules.<lb/> Protoplasts were then fixed and double-labelled with anti-β-tubulin antibody and the peptide<lb/> directed antiserum. When MTs were depolymerized (Fig. <ref type="figure">4h</ref>), the HaWLIM1 labelling<lb/> density was weak and completely disorganized (Fig. <ref type="figure">4g</ref>) but it could still be observed<lb/> HaWLIM1 spots lying on MTs fragments (Fig. <ref type="figure">4i</ref>). In contrast, protoplasts treated with 50<lb/> µM latrunculin B exhibited disrupted actin filaments (Fig. <ref type="figure">4j</ref>) but neither the microtubule<lb/> network (Fig. <ref type="figure">4k</ref>), nor the HaWLIM1 pattern (Fig. <ref type="figure">4l</ref>) were modified.<lb/></p>

			<p>In order to estimate the frequency of nuclear labelling in relation to the mitotic stage, DNA<lb/> labelling with Hoechst 33342 was performed on 3-day-old protoplasts previously<lb/> immunolabelled with A16 (Total number of protoplasts observed = 178). HaWLIM1 was<lb/> detected inside the nucleus of most protoplasts in interphase (92%). The labelling was either<lb/> diffuse (Fig. <ref type="figure">4m and 4n</ref>) or constituted of a dense aggregate of spots (Fig. <ref type="figure">4o</ref>). When present,<lb/> the nucleolus was not or very weakly labelled. In the perinuclear region HaWLIM1 proteins<lb/> appeared to be scattered, with only a few spots lying on the perinuclear network of<lb/> microtubules (Fig. <ref type="figure">4o</ref>).<lb/> </p>
			
			<head level="2">HaWLIM1 labelling in dividing protoplasts<lb/></head>
			
			<p>Different patterns of HaWLIM1 labelling were observed during the progression of mitosis.<lb/> The percentage of labelled nuclei decreased progressively (72% at the beginning of prophase,<lb/> 25% in late prophase/metaphase, 8% in metaphase, 0% in anaphase), and increased again in<lb/> telophase (100% at the end of telophase). In preprophase one could still observe a dual<lb/> localisation of HaWLIM1 staining: cortical and nuclear. However, the cortical labelling<lb/> appeared as scattered spots which did not seem to present any organization. Only a few<lb/> fluorescent spots lay on or alongside the preprophase band (PPB) when present (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a and<lb/> b</ref>). After nuclear envelope breakdown HaWLIM1 labelling was essentially distributed around<lb/> the mitotic apparatus, as seen in wide field microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>). At metaphase, confocal<lb/> sections showed mainly a high density of fluorescent spots surrounding the mitotic spindle<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>) and only few spots inside or on the spindle. In anaphase/telophase only a weak and<lb/> diffuse fluorescence could be detected in the nuclear region by wide field microscopy (Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">5e</ref>). Confocal observations clearly showed that this fluorescence was restricted to sparse spots<lb/> around the spindle and the early phragmoplast (Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>). In telophase, a punctate fluorescent<lb/> pattern was observed at the periphery of the phragmoplast. At the end of mitosis, daughter<lb/>nuclei recovered a strong labelling and the cortical labelling re-appeared (Fig. <ref type="figure">5g and h</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>In a previous work <ref type="biblio">(Mundel et al., 2000)</ref>, polypeptides detected in various tissues with anti-<lb/>HaWLIM1 antibody had variable molecular weights, ranging from 34kDa to above 50kDa. It<lb/> was then suggested that HaWLIM1 was able to form oligomeric structures. In protoplast<lb/> extracts, the same antiserum detects a major band at about 52kDa and several minor bands at<lb/> lower molecular weight, in particular one at 27kDa. The only polypeptide detected using<lb/> antibodies directed against specific peptides (P14 and P16) has also a molecular weight of<lb/> 27kDa. This weight is close to the theoretical weight of HaWLIM1 (21kDa) and this small<lb/> difference in weight may be easily explained by post-translational modifications: scanning the<lb/> protein sequence against PROSITE revealed three potential glycosylation sites (one in each<lb/> LIM domain and one in C-terminal) and four potential phosphorylation sites (one in each LIM<lb/> domain, one in N-terminal and one in C-terminal). More difficult to explain is the difference<lb/> between results obtained with the antibody against the whole protein, and with peptides<lb/> directed antibodies. On one hand, it is not unlikely that the antibody directed against the<lb/> purified GST-fusion protein has a weaker specificity than peptide-directed antibodies. On the<lb/> other hand, <ref type="biblio">Mundel et al. (2000)</ref> have shown that this antibody recognizes specifically a<lb/> 50kDa polypeptide in all tissues tested. But the essential result is that in hypocotyl<lb/> protoplasts, all antibodies detect the same 27kDa protein band. Thus, without excluding the<lb/> possibility of multimeric forms of the protein, our results show that HaWLIM1 is present as a<lb/> monomer in hypocotyl protoplasts.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>Immunolabelling clearly indicates that HaWLIM1 exhibits a dual nuclear and cytoplasmic<lb/> localization in protoplasts. These two localizations appear to be common to at least two<lb/> groups of LIM proteins: (i) the CRP group including the plant homologues, and (ii) at least<lb/> some of the non-homeodomain, non-CRP proteins such as zyxin and LPP. Localization of<lb/> LIM proteins depends on cell differentiation status. For instance, in undifferentiated<lb/> fibroblasts, CRP3/MLP was detected exclusively in the nucleus, while in differentiated<lb/> myotubes it is present in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm <ref type="biblio">(Arber et al., 1994 and 1996)</ref>. In<lb/> contrast, the nuclear phase of zyxin and LPP is transient and can only be detected indirectly,<lb/> by using nuclear-targeted antibodies <ref type="biblio">(Nix et al., 1997)</ref>, or by blocking nuclear export as in the<lb/> case of the LPP protein <ref type="biblio">(Petit et al., 2000)</ref>. The shuttling of these normally cytoplasmic<lb/> proteins to the nucleus and back to the cytoplasm is considered to be an example of<lb/> cytoplasmic-nuclear communication.<lb/></p>

			<p>In sunflower, a dual localization of the protein had already been reported in various sunflower<lb/> tissues <ref type="biblio">(Mundel et al., 2000)</ref>. Our results on hypocotyl protoplasts indicates that the location<lb/> of HaWLIM1 varies according to the developmental stage of the cell. In interphase<lb/> protoplasts, labelling was seen in both the nucleus (but not in the nucleolus) and the<lb/> cytoplasm. In dividing protoplasts, the labelling was essentially nuclear. In contrast to<lb/> previous observations by <ref type="biblio">Mundel et al. (2000)</ref>, the phragmoplast was only weakly labelled by<lb/> antibodies A14 and A16. This may be explained by a different specificity between affinity<lb/> purified peptide-directed antibodies and the antiserum against the whole recombinant protein<lb/> used by these authors. Furthermore, the latter recognizes several polypeptides, possibly<lb/> heterodimers, which may have a different location from that of the monomeric form of the<lb/> protein.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>The localization of HaWLIM1 in punctate structures located in the perinuclear region and in<lb/> the cortical cytoplasm appears to be common to plant LIM proteins. A punctate pattern for<lb/> HaWLIM1 had been observed already in meristematic cells of sunflower root tips <ref type="biblio">(Mundel et<lb/> al., 2000)</ref> and earlier studies on the pollen-specific protein HaPLIM1 had shown that the<lb/>protein accumulates in a limited number of small spots in microspores and in a dot-shaped<lb/> pattern in germination cones of mature pollen grains <ref type="biblio">(Baltz et al., 1999)</ref>. In sunflower<lb/> protoplasts, a strong colocalization of the protein with microtubules was observed. This<lb/> colocalization was particularly clear with cortical microtubules of interphase protoplasts. It is<lb/> worth noting that the best association between HaWLIM1 and cortical microtubules was<lb/> observed in 3-day old protoplasts (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>), when they have already reorganized their<lb/> cytoskeleton and rebuilt a cell wall <ref type="biblio">(Petitprez et al., 1995)</ref>, and thus cannot be ascribed to the<lb/> stress involved in protoplast generation. In animal cells, CRP proteins are known to be<lb/> associated with actin-based structures. CRP/MLP proteins have been detected in focal<lb/> adhesion sites and along stress fibres in cultured fibroblasts <ref type="biblio">(Louis et al., 1997; Sadler et al.,<lb/> 1992)</ref> and are thought to participate in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. In cardiac<lb/> muscle MLP has been found to concentrate in the Z bands separating the sarcomers and it is<lb/> believed that this protein acts in the anchoring of actin filaments to these sites. Similar<lb/> sarcomer localization was described in the case of the Drosophila MLP proteins <ref type="biblio">(Stronach et<lb/> al., 1999)</ref>. Furthermore, the animal CRP and MLP proteins were shown to interact with zyxin<lb/> and alpha-actinin <ref type="biblio">(Louis et al., 1997; Pomiès et al., 1997; Sadler et al., 1992)</ref>, two essential<lb/> components of the actin cytoskeletal architecture. To our knowledge, the only LIM domain<lb/> protein known to associate with the microtubule cytoskeleton is paxillin. In human T<lb/> lymphoblasts, paxillin localizes to sites of cell-matrix interaction as well as to a large<lb/> perinuclear region corresponding to the microtubule organizing centre, where paxillin<lb/> colocalizes with α-and γ-tubulin <ref type="biblio">(Herreros et al., 2000)</ref>. In plants, it has been reported that a<lb/> γ-tubulin-related polypeptide shows a punctate localization in cortical microtubule arrays and<lb/> in the preprophase band <ref type="biblio">(Liu et al., 1993 and 1995)</ref>, as does HaWLIM1. In sunflower<lb/> protoplasts there is evidence for two γ-tubulin isoforms with a dual cortical and nuclear<lb/> localization <ref type="biblio">(Petitprez et al., 2000)</ref>. However, there is no homology between HaWLIM1 and<lb/> paxillin. Furthermore, scanning the PROSITE database did not reveal the existence of any<lb/> tubulin-binding domains in HaWLIM1. It is thus difficult to advocate a direct association<lb/> between HaWLIM1 and tubulin.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>The apparent association between HaWLIM1 and microtubules might result from the<lb/> presence of fine actin filaments running alongside cortical microtubules. But disrupting the<lb/> actin with latrunculin B had no effect on this pattern, which, on the contrary, was completely<lb/> disorganized by microtubule depolymerization with oryzalin. Thus, such explanation cannot<lb/> account for the MT-like staining pattern. From another point of view, a vesicular transport of<lb/> the protein along microtubules cannot be excluded and would be consistent with the observed<lb/> punctate pattern and its disorganization by microtubule disruption.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>The nuclear localization of HaWLIM1 and its variation during the cell cycle suggest a role in<lb/> gene transcription. It is known indeed that not only LIM homeodomain proteins <ref type="biblio">(Wadman et<lb/> al., 1997)</ref>, but also members of the CRP-type group of LIM proteins participate in gene<lb/> transcription, as is exemplified by the CRP3/MLP protein <ref type="biblio">(Kong et al., 1997)</ref>. Furthermore, in<lb/> tobacco, the LIM protein NtLIM1, an HaWLIM1 homolog which is involved in lignin<lb/> biosynthesis, has been shown to transiently activate the transcription of a β-gluruconidase<lb/> reporter gene <ref type="biblio">(Kawaoka et al., 2000)</ref>. However, a typical plant transcription factor generally<lb/> contains a DNA-binding region and a nuclear localization signal <ref type="biblio">(Liu et al., 1999)</ref>, two<lb/> elements which appear not to be present in HaWLIM1, as revealed by sequence analysis with<lb/> PROSITE. Nevertheless, several potential sites of phosphorylation were identified, which<lb/> could play a role in the nuclear transport of the protein and/or in its regulation <ref type="biblio">(Vandromme et<lb/> al., 1996; Whitmarsh and Davis, 2000)</ref>. The strong decay of the protein observed at the<lb/> transition metaphase/anaphase is also consistent with a phosphorylation-dependent<lb/> proteolysis, and it is known that degradation of transcription factors or their coregulators is an<lb/> important mechanism of transcriptional regulation <ref type="biblio">(Pahl and Baeuerle, 1996)</ref>. Thus, instead of<lb/>being a transcription factor stricto sensu, a possible role for HaWLIM1 might be to participate<lb/> to the regulation of a transcription factor complex, like for instance FHL3, a LIM-only protein<lb/> which interacts with CDC25B2 phosphatase in the nucleus <ref type="biblio">(Mils et al., 2003)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, the data on the sunflower LIM-domain protein HaWLIM1 described in the<lb/> present paper are significant at several levels: they show that the protein (a) is present in<lb/> hypocotyl protoplasts, (b) exhibits a cell cycle-dependent cytoplasmic and nuclear<lb/> localization, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, even if more work will<lb/> be necessary to fully demonstrate this hypothesis and to characterize the partner(s) of the<lb/> protein, our observations suggest the existence of a, may be indirect, interaction between<lb/> HaWLIM1 and the microtubule network.<lb/></p>

			<p>Three different polyclonal antibodies were used for immunodetection and immunocytology.<lb/> HaWLIM1-antiserum against the GST-fusion protein was obtained as described in <ref type="biblio">Mundel et<lb/> al.

			<p>Protoplasts were suspended in <ref type="biblio">Laemmli (1970)</ref> buffer containing 4%(v/v) β-mercaptoethanol<lb/> and 2%(w/v) polyvinyl-polypyrolidone. They were lysed by sonication (Vibra Cell, Bioblock<lb/> Scientific) and centrifuged for 15 min at 15000 x g to eliminate cell fragments. Total proteins<lb/> in the supernatant were precipitated at -20°C by adding 3 vol. 80% acetone, and the insoluble<lb/> fraction washed three times in 80% acetone. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in<lb/> denaturating conditions by migration in a 12 % acrylamide gel. After migration, proteins were<lb/> transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra, Amersham). Membranes were<lb/> incubated for 2 h with anti-HaWLIM1, A14 or A16 antibodies in PBS buffer containing 0.1%<lb/> Tween 80 and 1% milk powder. After three washes in the same buffer, membranes were<lb/> exposed to anti-rabbit IgG goat antibodies coupled to RHP peroxydase (Promega) diluted to<lb/> 1:5000 and revealed by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham). Controls of specificity<lb/> have been done by pre-incubating A14 and A16 antibodies with corresponding peptides<lb/> (1:200) for 2h.<lb/> </p>

			<p>Protoplasts were fixed for 1 h in MSB buffer <ref type="biblio">(Traas, 1989)</ref> supplemented with 2%<lb/> paraformaldehyde and 0.03% glutaraldehyde. Proteins were stained according <ref type="biblio">Caumont et al.<lb/> (1997)</ref> by overnight incubation at room temperature with either rabbit HaWLIM1-antiserum<lb/> (dilution 1:5000), or antiserum against peptides P14 and P16 (dilution 1:2000), or affinity<lb/> purified primary antibodies A14 (dilution 1:100) or A16 (dilution 1:50). In the case of double<lb/> labelling, mouse monoclonal antibody (Amersham) directed against β-tubulin (dilution 1:125)<lb/> was added. After washing, protoplasts were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with FITC-<lb/>labelled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (dilution 1:50) and with Texas Red labelled anti-mouse<lb/> IgG antibodies (dilution 1:50) from Amersham. After rinsing, coverglasses were mounted in<lb/> an anti-fading buffer (Citifluor, Link Analytical). For negative controls, the same procedure<lb/>was followed but without the addition of primary antibodies or by adding the preimmune<lb/> serum in place of the primary antibodies at the same concentration. Specificity controls were<lb/> made by pre-incubating the primary antibodies A14 (dilution 1:100) and A16 (dilution 1:50)<lb/> with corresponding peptides P14 (2.3 mg/mL) and P16 (6 mg/mL) respectively for 2h before<lb/> immunolabelling.<lb/></p>

			<p>In some experiments, protoplasts were pre-treated with oryzalin or latrunculin B, which are<lb/> known to depolymerize microtubules <ref type="biblio">(Galway and Hardham, 1989)</ref> or to disrupt actin<lb/> filaments <ref type="biblio">(Gibbon et al., 1999)</ref> in plant cells, respectively. One-day-old protoplasts were<lb/> incubated with 7µM oryzalin or 50µM latrunculin B for 1h. They were then fixed and double<lb/> labelled as described above. Disruption of the actin network was checked by indirect<lb/> immunolabelling with mouse monoclonal antibody against actin (dilution 1:125) and Texas<lb/> Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (dilution 1:50) from Amersham.<lb/> Nucleus staining was performed by incubating protoplasts in an aqueous solution of 0.2µg/ml<lb/> Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 10 min after the immunolabelling treatment.<lb/> </p>
			
			<head level="2">Microscopy and image analysis<lb/> </head>
			
			<p>For conventional fluorescence microscopy, observations were made with a Leitz Laborlux<lb/> microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with epifluorescence illumination (for<lb/> Hoechst: excitation filter BP340-380, emission filter LP440, for FITC: excitation filter<lb/> BP450-490, emission filter LP520, and for Texas Red: excitation filter 530-560 nm, emission<lb/> filter LP580 ). Images were acquired using a PL APO 40x/1.32 oil objective lens (Leica) .<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>Confocal observations were made with a TCS SP2 confocal laser microscope (Leica,<lb/> Heidelberg, Germany). Image acquisition was achieved with a HCX PL APO 40x/1.25 Leica<lb/> objective lens in scan mode and image averaging of 3 frames. For FITC the 488 nm line of an<lb/> argon laser was used and the emission window set to 510–530nm. For Texas Red, the 543nm<lb/> line of a Helium/Neon laser was used and the emission window set to 600-700nm.<lb/> </p>
			
			<p>Quantification of colocalization of HaWLIM1 with tubulin was carried out on confocal<lb/> sections of double-labelled protoplasts. For each section two confocal images (one for<lb/> HaWLIM1 labelling, the other one for actin or tubulin labelling) were recorded in sequential<lb/> mode to avoid cross talking. Images were analysed with image processing software ImagePro<lb/> Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, USA). After thresholding the images to eliminate<lb/> background fluorescence, a region of interest (ROI) was carefully hand-designed inside the<lb/> protoplast area, excluding chloroplasts and the nuclear region. Then, the colocalization<lb/> coefficients were calculated according to the method described by <ref type="biblio">Manders et al. (1992)</ref>.<lb/> Results presented are mean percentages calculated on 30 image pairs analysed in the same<lb/> conditions.<lb/></p>
