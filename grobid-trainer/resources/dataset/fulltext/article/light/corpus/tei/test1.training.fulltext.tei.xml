			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Among women, invasive breast cancer is the most commonly<lb/> diagnosed female cancer in most countries worldwide. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> Increased<lb/> mammographic breast density, which describes the radiologically<lb/> appearing white tissue on a mammogram, is one of the strongest<lb/> breast cancer risk factors <ref type="biblio">2</ref> . A recent meta-analysis found that<lb/> percent density, which reflects the proportion of total breast area<lb/> comprised of dense fibroglandular tissue, is a stronger predictor of<lb/> risk than absolute dense area. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> It is estimated that 43% of US<lb/> women 40-74 years of age have dense breasts, <ref type="biblio">4</ref> but mechanisms<lb/> accounting for the relationship between elevated density and<lb/> breast cancer risk remain ill-defined.<lb/></p>

			<p>Studies highlight that pre-cancerous lesions <ref type="biblio">5</ref> and breast<lb/> tumors <ref type="biblio">6</ref> are more likely to occur in mammographically dense<lb/> regions within the breast, suggesting the relevance of localized as<lb/> well as global density measures in cancer development. The few<lb/> studies that have examined histological correlates of breast<lb/> density have suggested that higher breast density is associated<lb/> with greater epithelial cell content and non-fatty stroma. <ref type="biblio">7,8</ref> While<lb/> most studies to date have utilized quantitative microscopy to<lb/> characterize breast tissue from women undergoing procedures for<lb/> suspect lesions, one study of non-cancerous autopsy breast tissues<lb/> also showed positive relationships between epithelial and non-<lb/>fatty stromal tissue, particularly stromal collagen area, and percent<lb/> density. <ref type="biblio">9<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>Advancements in automated digital pathology now allow<lb/> increased opportunities for characterization and quantification of<lb/> breast tissue organization that can complement traditional<lb/> microscopic assessments. Moreover, increasingly, studies are<lb/> utilizing automated digital tools for complex tissue pathology<lb/> assessment of breast cancer outcomes. <ref type="biblio">10,11</ref> The recent incorpora-<lb/>tion of progressive artificial intelligence platforms into digital<lb/> pathology work systems now allows the utilization and expansion<lb/> of these approaches to larger scale molecular epidemiological<lb/> studies. Specifically, deep learning methods such as convolutional<lb/> neural networks, <ref type="biblio">12</ref> are increasingly being employed for histologi-<lb/>cal image recognition with high accuracy and reproducibility. <ref type="biblio">13-15<lb/></ref> We previously developed a deep learning convolutional neural<lb/> network model for the assessment of tissue characteristics in<lb/> hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole slide breast tissue<lb/> images, <ref type="biblio">16,17</ref> which classified whole slide images as epithelial,<lb/> stromal and fat tissue. In this current study, we hypothesized that<lb/> application of this model to whole slide images of H&amp;E-stained<lb/> fixed tissue specimens collected from diagnostic image-guided<lb/> breast biopsies might enable identification of specific histologic<lb/> correlates that underpin breast density, including both global and<lb/> localized (peri-lesional) measures. Secondly, as more than 25<lb/> million women in the US have dense breasts, <ref type="biblio">4</ref> and because only a<lb/> small proportion of these women will develop breast cancer, we<lb/> also aimed to identify tissue correlates of breast density that may<lb/> be important for distinguishing malignant from benign biopsy<lb/> diagnoses separately among women with high and low breast<lb/> density, to help inform cancer risk stratification among women<lb/> undergoing a biopsy following an abnormal mammogram.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head>

			<head>Patient characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>Overall, patient characteristics were largely similar between the<lb/> training (n = 588) and testing (n = 264) sets (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The mean<lb/> age was 50 years, and most women were of white race (91.3%),<lb/> college educated (82.3%), of normal weight (50.4%) and<lb/> premenopausal (58.1%). Most mammograms were categorized<lb/> after work-up as suspicious abnormality (BI-RADS diagnostic<lb/> category 4: 83.7%). The remainder were categorized as probably<lb/> benign (BI-RADS diagnostic category 3: 5.9%) or highly suggestive<lb/> of malignancy (BI-RADS diagnostic category 5: 10.5%). A little over<lb/> half of the core needle biopsies were ultrasound-guided (54.6%),<lb/> with the remainder being stereotactic-guided (45.3%). Median<lb/> global fibroglandular volume was 34.4%, and median localized<lb/> fibroglandular volume was 40.0%. No difference was observed for<lb/> global and localized fibroglandular volume between the training<lb/> and testing sets. Among the n = 1036 biopsy targets, most biopsy<lb/> diagnoses were benign (78.2%). Benign breast disease diagnoses<lb/> were categorized according to benign non-proliferative (including<lb/> non-proliferative fibrocystic change and other benign and discrete<lb/> entities), proliferative without atypia (including ductal hyperplasia<lb/> and sclerosing adenosis) and proliferative with atypia (including<lb/> atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasia). Further, 8.0% of all<lb/> biopsies yielded in-situ lesions, and 13.8% were invasive<lb/> carcinoma (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Associations between histologic features and breast density<lb/> (global and localized fibroglandular volume)<lb/></head> 

			<p>As mentioned in the methods, 37 features were extracted from<lb/> the output of the convolutional neural network model. Using<lb/> these identified features in separate random forest regression<lb/> models trained to predict global and localized fibroglandular<lb/> volume, the correlations between predicted and actual fibro-<lb/>glandular volume measurements were 0.94 for global and 0.93<lb/> for localized fibroglandular volume, respectively. The top 10<lb/> correlates identified as most important for predicting both<lb/> fibroglandular volume measurements are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, and<lb/> the corresponding Gini index plots for global and localized<lb/> fibroglandular volume are shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.<lb/> Overall, similar features were identified as correlates of global<lb/> and localized fibroglandular volume measures; however, some<lb/> differences were noted. Normalized non-fatty stromal tissue<lb/> quantity (i.e., stromal tissue quantity normalized to total breast<lb/> tissue area on the whole slide image) and normalized fat<lb/> quantity (i.e., fat tissue quantity normalized to breast tissue area<lb/> on the whole slide image) were the strongest predictors of both<lb/> global and localized fibroglandular volume. Of note, epithelium<lb/> quantity did not rank among the top 10 features for global<lb/> fibroglandular volume and was ranked 8th for localized<lb/> fibroglandular volume. Features characterizing the spatial<lb/> arrangement of the epithelial regions assessed using an area-<lb/>Voronoi diagram <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> were among the top 10 features ranked for<lb/> prediction of both global and localized fibroglandular volume.<lb/></p>

			<p>Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence<lb/> of body mass index (BMI) and menopausal status on the<lb/> predictions, and results from these investigations are detailed<lb/> in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. BMI was consistently ranked as the<lb/> strongest predictor of fibroglandular volume when included in<lb/> the model. Interestingly, in this model, the normalized fat<lb/> quantity was the next most important feature for both global<lb/> and localized fibroglandular volume, followed by normalized<lb/> non-fatty stroma quantity. When analyses were stratified by<lb/> menopausal status, some differences in top ranking features<lb/> were noted as outlined in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. For global<lb/> fibroglandular volume prediction, the top-ranked features were<lb/> similar; however, for localized fibroglandular volume, fat-related<lb/> variables ranked lower among postmenopausal women than for<lb/> premenopausal women.<lb/></p>

			<head>Exploratory investigation relating histologic features to biopsy<lb/> diagnosis among patients with high and low fibroglandular<lb/> volume<lb/> </head>

			<p>As elevated breast density is common among women, 4 yet only a<lb/> small proportion will develop invasive breast cancer, we aimed to<lb/> identify histological correlates that could inform future breast<lb/> cancer risk stratification among women undergoing diagnostic<lb/> biopsy with either high or low breast density. The main objective<lb/> of this exploratory investigation was to examine if the histologic<lb/> features that were associated with cancer status were similar and/<lb/> or different among women with low vs. high fibroglandular<lb/> volume. Thus, using the 37 features, a random forest classifier was<lb/> trained to predict invasive cancer vs. benign breast disease among<lb/> women stratified into high or low fibroglandular volume (using<lb/> the median cut-point of global (34.4%) and localized (40%)<lb/> fibroglandular volume from the training population). The top-<lb/>ranked features for predicting invasive cancer status separately<lb/> among women with high vs. low fibroglandular volume are shown<lb/> in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Firstly, features associated with the spatial arrange-<lb/>ments of the epithelial regions were ranked most important (top<lb/> two features) for predicting cancer status among women,<lb/> irrespective of global fibroglandular volume (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). H&amp;E images<lb/> highlighting examples of the top-ranked epithelial region spatial<lb/> arrangement features, with corresponding mammograms from<lb/> patients whose biopsies yielded diagnoses of atypical ductal<lb/> hyperplasia and invasive carcinoma, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2a, b</ref>,<lb/> respectively. Despite similar radiological global fibroglandular<lb/> volume on both mammograms, the H&amp;Es from each diagnostic<lb/> biopsy, targeted to locally dense regions within the breast, reflect<lb/> differences in the spatial arrangement of epithelium (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a, b</ref>).<lb/> Within Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, two features are highlighted: the mean and median<lb/> area ratio of each epithelial region to its Voronoi region. Figure <ref type="figure">2a<lb/></ref> represents a H&amp;E whole slide image with low mean and median<lb/> area ratio of each epithelial region to its Voronoi region. This slide<lb/> has a diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia and has both global<lb/> and localized fibroglandular volume &gt; median (global fibrogland-<lb/>ular volume: 45%; localized fibroglandular volume: 61%). In<lb/> contrast, Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref> represents a H&amp;E whole slide image with higher<lb/> mean and median area ratio of each epithelial region to its<lb/> Voronoi. This slide has a diagnosis of invasive carcinoma and has<lb/> both global and localized fibroglandular volume &gt; median (global<lb/> fibroglandular volume: 49%; localized fibroglandular volume:<lb/> 49%). Features of epithelial regions were also strongly associated<lb/> with invasive cancer status in models stratified by localized<lb/> fibroglandular volume. Among women with high localized<lb/> fibroglandular volume, epithelial morphology features ranked as<lb/> the most important (4 out of the top 5). Among women with low<lb/> localized fibroglandular volume, epithelium quantity and the<lb/></p>

			<p>The performance of the model for predicting invasive cancer<lb/> among women with high vs. low global fibroglandular volume in<lb/> the testing set is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a,b</ref> . An AUC of 0.92 (95% CI:<lb/> 0.80-0.99) was achieved for predicting invasive cancer diagnosis<lb/> among women with high global fibroglandular volume, and an<lb/> AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71-0.94) was reached for predicting an<lb/> invasive cancer diagnosis among women with low global<lb/> fibroglandular volume. For cancer detection stratified according<lb/> to high and low localized fibroglandular volume, similar predic-<lb/>tion values were observed, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3c, d</ref> (high localized<lb/> fibroglandular volume: AUC: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.79-0.99); low<lb/> localized fibroglandular volume: AUC: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.65-0.96)).<lb/> No significant differences were observed between the AUCs for<lb/> high vs. low global (p = 0.24) or localized fibroglandular volume<lb/> (p = 0.24).<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>We report that we can predict global and local mammographic<lb/> fibroglandular volume by applying a deep convolutional neural<lb/> network model to H&amp;E-stained sections of image-guided breast<lb/> biopsies prompted by an abnormal mammogram. Specifically, we<lb/> show that greater non-fatty stromal and adipose tissue content<lb/> and the spatial distribution of epithelial regions in tissues, rather<lb/> than total epithelial quantities, were the strongest correlates of %<lb/> fibroglandular volume. The cardinal histopathologic feature of<lb/> breast cancer on low magnification is &apos;invasion&apos;, characterized by<lb/> irregular epithelial growth with incursion of cells into normal<lb/> structures. As anticipated, features extracted from the output of<lb/> the convolutional neural network indicated that epithelial<lb/> organization is the strongest correlate of invasive cancer<lb/> irrespective of fibroglandular volume. Thus, we hypothesize that<lb/> more complex analyses of dense tissue using convolutional neural<lb/> networks or other imaging technologies may enable radiological<lb/></p>

			<p>recognition of textural patterns that reflect the epithelial<lb/> disorganization characteristic of breast cancer. Recent preliminary<lb/> analyses using convolutional neural networks suggest the<lb/> potential of this approach. <ref type="biblio">20<lb/></ref></p>

			<p>Our findings agree with prior literature using quantitative<lb/> microscopy <ref type="biblio">9</ref> to understand histological correlates of breast<lb/> density. Similarly, our findings support prior studies that suggest<lb/> radiological density is largely non-fatty stroma, with relatively little<lb/> variation in epithelial content by mammographic density. <ref type="biblio">8,9<lb/></ref> Further, we showed that other quantitative measures of fat tissue<lb/> were also highly ranked as being important for the prediction of %<lb/> fibroglandular volume. The heterogeneous nature of the top-<lb/>ranked histologic features further supports the complexity of<lb/> quantitative measures of breast density. A novel finding of our<lb/> study was the identification of the spatial arrangement of<lb/> epithelial regions as ranking among the top 10 correlates of<lb/> fibroglandular volume. To define spatial arrangements, we used<lb/> an area-Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation, which are<lb/> approaches that would be very difficult to reproduce using visual<lb/> assessment. Voronoi decomposition is a method whereby an area<lb/> is partitioned into smaller areas that surround regions that are<lb/> closest to pre-specified points. <ref type="biblio">19,21</ref> In essence, our results suggest<lb/> that tissues that display a high ratio of epithelial area to its<lb/> corresponding areas of influence are characteristic of cancer in<lb/> both high and low global fibroglandular volume contexts. The<lb/> identified Voronoi area along with the area ratio of each epithelial<lb/> region to its Voronoi region ranked among the top 10 correlates<lb/> for both global and localized fibroglandular volume measures.<lb/></p>

			<p>Beck and colleagues were among the first to highlight the<lb/> potential of digital image analysis for examining histological<lb/> features of breast cancer. They developed and utilized C-Path<lb/> (Computational Pathologist), a machine learning tool, which<lb/> identified features of stromal morphology that were especially<lb/> important for predicting breast cancer prognosis. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> Although<lb/> prognosis was not the focus of our analyses, using a similar<lb/> approach, we also found that the quantity of non-fatty breast<lb/> stromal tissue was among the top-ranked predictors of fibro-<lb/>glandular volume, supporting the contributory role of stroma to<lb/> fibroglandular volume. This study highlights the importance of<lb/> examining the tissue microenvironment of dense tissue in more<lb/> detail, including conducting in-depth analysis of stromal compo-<lb/>nents <ref type="biblio">17</ref> including collagen. <ref type="biblio">22,23<lb/></ref></p> 

			<p>A major clinical challenge is differentiating between the non-<lb/>fatty stroma and at-risk epithelium that together constitute the<lb/> &apos;white&apos; dense areas that appear on a mammogram. Thus, despite<lb/> similar measures of breast density for a radiologically dense<lb/> breast, there could be considerable heterogeneity of tissue<lb/> composition within the dense regions. As density alone may not<lb/> be capable of defining epithelial organization, other techniques<lb/> are needed. Potential solutions could be alternative imaging or<lb/> further classification of density using neural networks. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> Findings<lb/> from our exploratory analysis relating histologic correlates to<lb/> biopsy diagnosis highlight the interindividual heterogeneity that<lb/> may be apparent at the histological level despite having<lb/> comparable radiological densities. Interestingly, we found that<lb/> irrespective of fibroglandular volume, spatial arrangement of<lb/> epithelium was the most predictive of a cancer diagnosis, showing<lb/> that deciphering composition of the mammographic fibrogland-<lb/>ular volume is important for identifying abnormalities at the<lb/> histological level. Of note, the performance of the model was<lb/> better in detecting cancer status among women with high<lb/> fibroglandular volume (both global and localized) than among<lb/> women with low fibroglandular volume, though this difference<lb/> was not statistically significant. This could be an artifact of the<lb/> model, i.e., a challenge of recognizing spatial patterns in low<lb/> density. However, this finding could also support the concept of<lb/> epithelial-stromal interaction in the progression of invasive cancer.<lb/> Understanding the heterogeneity <ref type="biblio">24</ref> and significance of the<lb/> epithelial region spatial arrangement and organization may<lb/> provide important etiological clues for tumorigenesis, and<lb/> additional assessment of these features is needed to examine<lb/> their relationships with other epithelial histological risk markers<lb/> including terminal duct lobular units. <ref type="biblio">25<lb/></ref></p> 

			<p>Since the publication by Beck and colleagues, there have been<lb/> substantial advancements in digital pathology methodology,<lb/> particularly with the advent of deep learning. For example, our<lb/> investigation complements and expands on existing studies that<lb/> have highlighted the potential of deep learning for identifying<lb/> factors associated with breast cancer diagnosis. <ref type="biblio">14,15,26-28</ref> The<lb/> publication of the CAMELYON16 challenge winners showed the<lb/> ability of deep learning algorithms to detect lymph node<lb/> metastasis with high accuracy with a comparable AUC to that<lb/> obtained following pathological assessment (AUC = 0.96). <ref type="biblio">15</ref> While<lb/> our limited sample size and the cross-sectional nature of the study<lb/> design prevented detailed investigation of features associated<lb/> with breast biopsy diagnoses, our preliminary findings also<lb/> support the need for further investigations of biopsy tissue using<lb/> deep learning algorithms.<lb/></p>

			<p>feature assessment alone and without the inclusion of additional<lb/> breast cancer risk factor information suggests the utility of deep<lb/> learning approaches for the clinical setting. However, to investi-<lb/>gate potential influences of patient characteristics, we conducted<lb/> sensitivity analyses. As expected given its well-established strong<lb/> inverse association with % fibroglandular volume, <ref type="biblio">29</ref> BMI was the<lb/> highest ranked feature for predicting % fibroglandular volume for<lb/> models in which it was included. While recognition of clinical and<lb/> participant characteristics is important, the inclusion of such<lb/> factors in analytical models may mask lesser associations<lb/> identified by the random forest approach. Second, clinically<lb/> relevant histological features of biopsy tissue accompanied with<lb/> radiological information may be of benefit to integrate into breast<lb/> cancer risk models, <ref type="biblio">30</ref> which are increasingly being used in clinical<lb/> practice for determining risk of invasive breast cancer. Our<lb/> findings are of particular relevance for women with elevated<lb/> breast density, who have had a prior breast biopsy, and as such<lb/> are at elevated risk of developing invasive breast cancer. We aim<lb/> that by identifying validated histological features at the time of<lb/> clinical biopsy following an abnormal mammogram, we may be<lb/> able to discriminate women at highest risk. Increased efforts are<lb/> ongoing to include histological information, as well as mammo-<lb/>graphic density, in risk prediction tools as evidenced by the BCSC-<lb/>BBD model. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> However, these current risk models do not yet<lb/> incorporate detailed histology in risk estimates. The integration of<lb/> biopsy histological features to current risk models that assess<lb/> radiological and risk factor information may ultimately improve<lb/> risk assessment and inform clinical management strategies by<lb/> providing additional risk information on the increasing number of<lb/> women undergoing breast biopsies after a mammogram.<lb/> Furthermore, the application of deep learning models that can<lb/> utilize histological breast biopsy features to predict future risk of<lb/> breast cancer among women with dense breasts will be important<lb/> among the growing population of women who experience an<lb/> initial benign breast biopsy diagnosis. Future expanded studies<lb/> will address these questions.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Our study has many strengths. Firstly, this analysis is one of the<lb/> largest breast tissue studies to date to apply convolutional neural<lb/> network models for the identification of tissue correlates of<lb/> mammographic breast density. Further, from a biological mechan-<lb/>istic perspective, the ability to examine relationships between<lb/> breast tissue features and localized fibroglandular volume<lb/> measures allows the additional assessment of characteristics of<lb/> the microenvironment of the suspect lesion, particularly factors<lb/> that cannot be quantified by visual assessment but that may be<lb/> important markers of cancer. Of note, we observed similarities in<lb/> the top identified histologic correlates of both global and localized<lb/> % fibroglandular volume, supporting the utility of biopsy tissues in<lb/> </p>

			<p>understanding the global breast milieu. Further strengths of this<lb/> study included the use of deep learning for delineating<lb/> characteristics of tissue organization as well as for quantification<lb/> of tissue components. Additionally, the utilization of diagnostic<lb/> H&amp;E whole slide images supports investigations of samples that<lb/> are routinely collected during the clinical investigation following a<lb/> biopsy, which suggests this approach may have clinical applic-<lb/>ability and could compliment routine diagnostic assessment. This<lb/> study related volumetric measures of breast density, determined<lb/> from FFDM images, to 2D histological images from FFPE tissues,<lb/> providing an important step toward a novel and complex<lb/> approach to understanding breast cancer lesions and their<lb/> relationships with breast density. Additional understanding of<lb/> volumetric breast density would be gained by examining the 3D<lb/> architecture of the BBD and breast cancer diagnoses. For example,<lb/> future studies that incorporate volumetric density measures from<lb/> 3D imaging modalities along with fresh tissues will provide a<lb/> complementary extension to these findings.<lb/></p> 

			<p>However, this study also has limitations. While random forest<lb/> approaches are effective in deciphering which histological<lb/> features contribute most to model prediction, they do not yield<lb/> easily quantifiable results for strengths of association. Our<lb/> investigation of deep learning approaches to identify histologic<lb/> features associated with cancer among women with high versus<lb/> low breast density, while promising, was hampered by sample<lb/> size. In our current sample set, the number of cancer cases within<lb/> the testing dataset was limited in order to maximize the reliability<lb/> of model training. Thus, additional, larger prospective studies are<lb/> needed to identify biomarkers for cancer risk stratification among<lb/> women with high breast density who may be referred to<lb/> diagnostic biopsy following an abnormal mammogram. While<lb/> the BREAST-Stamp participants are a representative sample of the<lb/> population of women undergoing diagnostic investigation after<lb/> an abnormal breast imaging exam, the women enrolled within the<lb/> study were primarily white (91.3%), which is reflective of the<lb/> catchment area of the University of Vermont Cancer Center.<lb/> Further, detailed information on lifestyle factors including alcohol<lb/> consumption and smoking were not available for the full study<lb/> population in this analysis. Thus, additional studies among more<lb/> diverse populations are warranted to determine the general-<lb/>izability of study findings and to determine whether tissue<lb/> correlates of mammographic density vary by race and also by<lb/> lifestyle breast cancer risk factors. In addition, our analysis was<lb/> restricted to H&amp;E-stained tissue sections. While using H&amp;E sections<lb/> is important as they are clinically meaningful and routinely<lb/> prepared following biopsy, investigation of features associated<lb/> with complementary histological stains to characterize the breast<lb/> microenvironment may also be informative. An additional<lb/> consideration is the applicability of this approach to other<lb/> populations. This investigation included breast tissue sections<lb/> from a single cross-sectional study, for which standardized<lb/> protocols were followed for specimen preparation, tissue section-<lb/>ing and staining, and were completed in the same laboratory at<lb/> the University of Vermont Medical Center. While this rigorous<lb/> methodology reduced potential variability in the tissue samples<lb/> being assessed, it may limit the generalizability of the findings.<lb/> The approach applied in this current study used extensive contrast<lb/> and color augmentation during training. This method increases<lb/> the robustness of the deep learning model against staining<lb/> variations, but may not be sufficient when dealing with external<lb/> datasets with significant staining variations. Therefore, additional<lb/> validation studies are needed that include tissue sections<lb/> prepared in multiple laboratories. Such studies would be highly<lb/> informative for determining the robustness of deep learning<lb/> within diverse pathological clinical settings.<lb/></p>

			<p>In conclusion, we highlight the potential of applying convolu-<lb/>tional neural network models to digital pathology to gain insights<lb/> into histological correlates that correspond to radiologic measures<lb/> of breast fibroglandular volume, and to cancer risk. In doing so, in<lb/> a population of women undergoing diagnostic breast biopsy, we<lb/> found that epithelial organization was the strongest correlate of<lb/> invasive cancer irrespective of fibroglandular volume. In addition,<lb/> we found in agreement with prior studies that fat and non-fatty<lb/> stromal features were important determinants of radiologic<lb/> fibroglandular volume. As radiologic density alone may not be<lb/> capable of defining epithelial organization, these findings suggest<lb/> opportunities for future efforts using neural networks for<lb/> enhanced capture of novel histologic as well as breast imaging<lb/> features that may advance our understanding of breast<lb/> tumorigenesis.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/></head> 

			<head>Study population<lb/></head>

			<p>This study included women referred for diagnostic image-guided breast<lb/> biopsy after an abnormal breast imaging exam between October 2007 and<lb/> June 2010 at the University of Vermont Medical Center, and were enrolled as<lb/> part of the National Cancer Institute&apos;s (NCI) cross-sectional, molecular<lb/> epidemiologic Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (BREAST)-<lb/>Stamp Project. Details of the BREAST Stamp Project and study eligibility<lb/> characteristics have been described previously. <ref type="biblio">25,29,32</ref> Eligible participants<lb/> were women aged 40-65 years referred for image-guided biopsy who did<lb/> not have breast implants, had not been diagnosed with breast cancer or<lb/> received cancer treatments, had not undergone breast surgery within one<lb/> year and had not received chemoprevention. During the enrollment period,<lb/> mammography registry data indicated that 1227 patients met these<lb/> eligibility criteria. Information supplied by the radiology facility included<lb/> final assessment of the mammogram, in BI-RADS categories: 3, &quot;probably<lb/> benign finding&quot;; 4, &quot;suspicious abnormality&quot;; and 5, &quot;highly suggestive of<lb/> malignancy&quot;. <ref type="biblio">33</ref> A standard health history questionnaire which assessed<lb/> established breast cancer risk factors was collected at the time of the<lb/> mammogram, <ref type="biblio">34</ref> and upon providing consent to be enrolled in the study,<lb/> additional detailed breast cancer risk factor information was collected by the<lb/> research coordinator. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> The distribution of the collected breast cancer risk<lb/> factor information, including the demographic and lifestyle characteristics of<lb/> the enrolled BREAST Stamp study population, has been previously<lb/> described. <ref type="biblio">25,29,32</ref> Details of the analytical population included in this current<lb/> analysis are outlined in more detail below and described in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The<lb/> Institutional Review Boards at the NCI and the University of Vermont<lb/> approved the protocol for this project for either active consenting or a waiver<lb/> of consent to enroll participants, link data and perform analytical studies.<lb/></p>

			<head>Breast biopsy specimens<lb/></head>

			<p>Breast tissues obtained from ultrasound-guided core needle (14-gauge) or<lb/> stereotactic-guided vacuum-assisted (9-gauge) biopsy, were routinely<lb/> processed, and representative H&amp;E-stained breast tissue sections were<lb/> obtained from the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded target blocks for each<lb/> biopsy and, when collected during biopsy, from non-target blocks<lb/> representing surrounding non-target tissue. The diagnosis was confirmed<lb/> following pathological report review. For women who had ≥ two unilateral<lb/> biopsy targets, the two targets with the most severe diagnoses were<lb/></p>

			<head>Assessment of breast density<lb/></head>

			<p>Assessment of breast density was conducted at the University of California,<lb/> San Francisco on pre-biopsy raw digital mammograms from full-field<lb/> digital mammography systems. <ref type="biblio">25,29,32,35,36</ref> Briefly, quantitative global <ref type="biblio">29</ref> and<lb/> localized <ref type="biblio">25</ref> fibroglandular tissue volume (cm 3 ) measures were determined<lb/> using craniocaudal mammograms of the ipsilateral breast, taken at the<lb/> time-point prior but nearest to the biopsy date. Percent (%) global<lb/> fibroglandular volume was estimated using Single X-ray Absorptiometry,<lb/> which utilized a breast density phantom attached to the compression<lb/> paddle of the mammography machine. <ref type="biblio">25,29,32,35,36</ref> For the assessment of %<lb/> localized peri-lesional fibroglandular volume measurements, the biopsy<lb/> location and radius were identified on the pre-biopsy mammogram by the<lb/> study radiologist. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> Localized % fibroglandular volume measurements at a<lb/> volume~0-2 mm 3 surrounding but excluding the biopsy target location<lb/> were utilized in this analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analytical population<lb/></head>

			<p>Of the women eligible for this study, 882 (69%) had Single X-ray<lb/> Absorptiometry fibroglandular volume results available for the ipsilateral<lb/> breast within the year before their breast biopsy. Of these, 852 women had<lb/> target and non-target H&amp;E slides from 1036 breast biopsies available for<lb/> assessment. For convolutional neural network model training and<lb/> assessment, as outlined in more detail below, the study population was<lb/> randomly subdivided into a training dataset (n = 588; 69%) and a testing<lb/> dataset (n = 264; 31%). Overall, the 588 women in the training set had 687<lb/> biopsies which encompassed 1587 H&amp;E stained sections (667 from the<lb/> target and 920 from the non-target blocks). For the testing group of 264<lb/> women, there were 349 biopsies (454 sections from non-target blocks). An<lb/> overview of the study design is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Development of the deep learning convolutional neural network<lb/> model<lb/></head>

			<p>Using the digitized H&amp;E whole slide images from 588 women included in<lb/> the training set, a deep convolutional neural network was trained to<lb/> generate maps of tissue composition that classified whole slide images as<lb/> epithelial, stromal and fat tissue. <ref type="biblio">16,17</ref> For model training, both target and<lb/> non-target slides were included. The trained model was an 11-layer fully<lb/> convolutional VGG-like network, a neural network architecture developed<lb/> by Oxford&apos;s Visual Geometry Group (VGG). <ref type="biblio">37</ref> The performance of the<lb/> convolutional neural network model for generating whole slide image<lb/> maps of epithelial, stromal and fat tissue has been outlined previously, <ref type="biblio">16<lb/></ref> and an example of the classification is shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.<lb/> Briefly, the initial classification of the breast tissue (epithelial, stromal and<lb/> fat composition) was completed through training of the convolutional<lb/> neural network model based on manual annotation of these regions in<lb/> 100 whole slide images, by trained students; these annotations were<lb/> furthered reviewed by a pathologist. The AUC of the model for the<lb/> classification of the breast tissue was 0.95. <ref type="biblio">16</ref> Following the generation of<lb/> the whole slide image maps, features were extracted from the output of<lb/> the convolutional neural network. These features were grouped into<lb/> three main categories, describing global tissue quantities, the morphol-<lb/>ogy of the epithelial regions, and spatial arrangements of epithelial<lb/> regions. To examine spatial arrangements of epithelial regions, region<lb/> adjacency graphs were used including area-Voronoi diagrams and<lb/> Delaunay triangulation. <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> The area-Voronoi diagram was utilized in<lb/> the context of spatial distribution analysis to define areas of influence of<lb/> epithelial regions in the image. Given a set of segmented epithelial<lb/> regions A 1 ,…,A n in a whole slide image, the area-Voronoi of a region V a<lb/> (A i ) is defined as the set of pixels in the image from which the distance to<lb/> A i is less than or equal to any other regions in the image. Overall, 37<lb/> features were extracted within these three categories; a description of<lb/> the 37 features and their distributions in the training and testing sets are<lb/> shown in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Statistical analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Patient characteristics were compared between the training and testing<lb/> sets using chi-square or Fisher&apos;s exact tests for categorical variables and<lb/> Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables. Using the 37 features<lb/> extracted from the output of the convolutional neural network, a random<lb/> forest regression model was used to predict global fibroglandular volume<lb/> (%) and a separate random forest model was used to predict localized<lb/> fibroglandular volume (%) (i.e., in the region of the biopsy target). The<lb/> scikit-learn <ref type="biblio">21</ref> Python method was used for training of the random forest<lb/> models. These models were then applied to the independent testing set to<lb/> predict the fibroglandular volume measures. We chose random forests as<lb/> this approach can account for any non-linear relationships between the<lb/> features and has been shown to work well even when the number of<lb/> features exceeds the number of observations. <ref type="biblio">38</ref> The output from the<lb/> random forest model includes the Gini index plot as a measure of the<lb/> predictive importance of the features. Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the Gini<lb/> index results for features associated with global and localized %<lb/> fibroglandular volume. Relationships between the predicted and radi-<lb/>ologically quantified (actual) fibroglandular volume measures were<lb/> assessed using Spearman rank correlations (r). Several sensitivity analyses<lb/> examined the potential influence of participant characteristics known to be<lb/> associated with fibroglandular volume on observed findings: (a) we<lb/> additionally included body mass index (BMI) in the random forest<lb/> regression model; and (b) we stratified analyses by menopausal status.<lb/> We also assessed the potential influence of histologic features that were<lb/> strongly correlated with each other in the prediction model. For highly<lb/> correlated feature pairs (Spearman correlation: r ≥ 0.85), one feature was<lb/> randomly selected to be excluded from the model. We then retrained the<lb/> random forest models on the remaining 25 features. We also used the 25<lb/> features to separately predict each fibroglandular volume measure. When<lb/> the number of features in the prediction model was reduced to include<lb/> only one from among highly correlated features, the top selected features<lb/> for fibroglandular volume prediction were similar; therefore, we present<lb/> results from random forest analyses including all 37 features.<lb/></p>

			<p>In an exploratory analysis, we examined the potential of the extracted<lb/> histologic features for predicting cancer status (benign vs. invasive<lb/> biopsy diagnosis) among women with high and low fibroglandular<lb/> volume. Firstly, the patient population was stratified by fibroglandular<lb/> volume (high vs. low), using the median cut point of global (34.4%) and<lb/> localized (40%) fibroglandular volume from the training population. For<lb/> this analysis, all in-situ diagnoses were excluded from both model<lb/> training and testing. Thus the cancerous group was restricted to biopsy<lb/> diagnoses of invasive carcinoma and the benign group included<lb/> diagnoses of non-proliferative and proliferative benign breast disease<lb/> (with and without atypia). Using the 37 features previously extracted<lb/> from the convolutional neural network output, a random forest classifier<lb/> was trained to predict cancer status separately among women with high<lb/> and low fibroglandular volume. The classifier performance for cancer<lb/> status prediction was assessed using area under the receiver-operating<lb/> characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analysis on the probabilities generated<lb/> by the random forest classifier. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were<lb/> generated using a patient-stratified percentile bootstrapping method. <ref type="biblio">39<lb/></ref> ROC curves of the cancer detection systems among patients with high<lb/> and low global or localized % fibroglandular volume were compared<lb/> using the bootstrap method in R package &quot;pROC&quot;, which computes,<lb/> stores and compares the AUC of each ROC curve. <ref type="biblio">40</ref></p>
