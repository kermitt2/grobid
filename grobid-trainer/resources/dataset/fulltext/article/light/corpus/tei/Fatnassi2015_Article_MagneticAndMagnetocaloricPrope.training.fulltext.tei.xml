			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The modern society is increasingly relying on refrigeration<lb/> technology. The vapor compression refrigerators have been<lb/> mainly used for cooling applications. However, the com-<lb/>pression and expanding processes in the refrigerators of a gas<lb/> are not sufficiently efficient. On the other hand, the use of<lb/> gases such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydro-chlorofluoro-<lb/>carbons is damaging to our living environment. For these<lb/> reasons, exploring a new type refrigeration technology that is<lb/> environmentally friendly and energy efficient becomes an<lb/> urgent necessity. Comparing to the conventional gas com-<lb/>pression (CGC), magnetic refrigeration (MR) based on the<lb/> magnetocaloric effect (MCE) <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref> exhibits several advan-<lb/>tages <ref type="biblio">[2, 3]</ref>. Indeed, the MR does not use global warming<lb/> gases and therefore is an environmentally friendly cooling<lb/> technology <ref type="biblio">[4, 5]</ref>. So an ongoing research is necessary to find<lb/> appropriate materials with a large enough magnetic entropy<lb/> at moderate magnetic fields near room temperature <ref type="biblio">[5, 6]</ref>.<lb/> The gadolinium (Gd) rare earth metal has been considered as<lb/> the most obvious material exhibiting a large MCE in room-<lb/>temperature magnetic refrigerators <ref type="biblio">[2, 7, 8]</ref>. However, the<lb/> use of the Gd is limited due to its expensive cost price.<lb/> Nevertheless, some other candidates have been found<lb/> to exhibit large MCE, such as Gd 5 (Si x Ge 1-x ) 4 <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>, La<lb/> (Fe 1-x Si x ) 13 <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>, MnFeP 1-x As x <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>, and Tb 1-x Gd x A l2 <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the last few years, manganites with a general formula<lb/> R 1-x A x MnO 3 (R = rare earth, A = alkali earth) have<lb/> attracted more attention as alternative candidates for MR<lb/> near room temperature. Compared to Gd, they show sev-<lb/>eral advantages such as higher chemical stability, higher<lb/> resistivity, and lower cost. Their preparation can be<lb/> achieved without substantial difficulties. As other advan-<lb/>tages, they present the possibility to tune their magnetic<lb/> transition temperature by the substitution on both R-sites<lb/> and Mn-sites. The MCE of La 1-x A x MnO 3 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba)<lb/> manganites was first studied by Moreli et al. <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. A large<lb/> MCE in La 1-x A x MnO 3 polycrystalline samples<lb/> (0.2 B x B 0. 33) is reported by Guo et al. <ref type="biblio">[14, 15]</ref>. In fact,<lb/> for DH = 1.5 T, the DS M<lb/> j<lb/> j reaches a maximum of about<lb/> 5.5 J/(kg K) at 230 K, 4.7 J/(kg K) at 224 K, and 4.3 J/<lb/> (kg K) at 260 K for x = 0.2, 0.25, and 0.33, respectively<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. For the same magnetic field of 1.5 T, these values are<lb/> larger than that of Gd, DS M<lb/> j<lb/> j = 4.2 J/(kg K) <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>. As other<lb/> significant information, the magnitude of DS M<lb/> j<lb/> j was found<lb/> to be inversely proportional to the grain size <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. This<lb/> paper is devoted to seeking for new perovskite manganites<lb/> with broad refrigerant capacity and large MCE demanding<lb/> only low applied magnetic fields close to the room tem-<lb/>perature. Precisely, we report the effect of Fe doping on the<lb/> magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of La 0.8 Ca 0.2-<lb/>Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, 0.2). They present large<lb/> magnetic entropy change values and high relative cooling<lb/> power (RCP) factors.<lb/></p>

			<head>Experimental<lb/></head>

			<p>The nano-sized La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.15,<lb/> 0.2) manganites were synthesized using the sol-gel method.<lb/> The starting precursor MnO 2 was mixed in appropriate<lb/> proportion and dissolved in the concentrated nitric acid.<lb/> Suitable amounts of citric acid and ethylene glycol, as a<lb/> coordinate agent, were added. After the addition of the other<lb/> precursors La 2 O 3 , CaCO 3 , and Fe 2 O 3 , a clear black stained<lb/> solution was obtained. Then the solution is allowed to dry to<lb/> form a dried gel, followed by baking at 170°C to obtain black<lb/> precursor powder. Finally, the resulting powder was heated<lb/> in air at 950°C for 24 h. The X-ray diffraction patterns at<lb/> room temperature were obtained using SIEMENS D8 X-ray<lb/> diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation. The FULLPROF pro-<lb/>gram based on the Rietveld method <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref> was used for phase<lb/> analysis. The magnetic isotherms were recorded in the<lb/> magnetic field of up to 5 T and at the temperature ranging<lb/> from 4 to 400 K. The magnetocaloric effects (MCE) were<lb/> estimated via the Maxwell relation <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results and discussion<lb/></head>

			<head>X-ray diffraction<lb/></head>

			<p>Powder X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) show that the<lb/> samples show single phase and indexed in the<lb/> orthorhombic structure with Pnma group space (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/> Refined cell parameters such as unit cell parameters, unit<lb/> cell volume, R factor, and the goodness-of-fit indicator (v 2 )<lb/> are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. We can deduce that the substitution of<lb/> Mn 3? by Fe 3? ions induces an increase of the unit cell<lb/> volume. The linear increase is unexpected because we<lb/> substitute Mn 3? having 0.0645 nm as ionic radius by Fe 3?<lb/> with the same ionic radius (0.0645 nm). Consequently, no<lb/> change induced by this substitution is expected. Therefore,<lb/> the increase could be attributed to the lattice disorder<lb/> arising from the random occupancy of Fe and Mn ions on<lb/> the B-site. Indeed, in the pure perovskite La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3<lb/></p>

Positions for the<lb/> Bragg reflections are markedly vertical bars. Differences between the<lb/> observed and the calculated intensities are shown at the bottom of the<lb/> figure<lb/></figure>

			<p>system (LCMO), Mn shows a mixed valence with Mn 3? /<lb/> Mn 4? ratio close to 4 ([Mn 4? ] = 0.2 and [Mn 3? ] = 0.8)<lb/> with a valence of ?3 for La. The partial substitution of the<lb/> Mn ions by transition metal ions (Fe) in La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x-<lb/>Fe x O 3 manganites gives rise to changes in the Mn 3? /Mn 4?<lb/> rate, and some Mn 3? -O 2--Mn 4? networks are substituted<lb/> by Fe 3? -O 2--Mn 4?. This causes a disorder of the charge<lb/> transfer mechanism. Such disorder causes a change in the<lb/> Mn-O distances and Mn-O-Mn angles. Consequently, the<lb/> distortion of the ideal perovskite structure in which the<lb/> Mn-O-Mn angle is equal to 180°undergoes a modifica-<lb/>tion. These results are similar to those obtained by Othmani<lb/> et al. <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Magnetic properties<lb/></head>

			<p>To study the effect of substitution of iron in manganese<lb/> sites on the magnetic properties, we have analyzed the<lb/> magnetization variation versus temperature of La 0.8 Ca 0.2-<lb/>Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, 0.2) samples under an<lb/> applied magnetic field of H = 0.05 T (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The<lb/> M (T) curves reveal that all samples exhibit a ferromag-<lb/>netic (FM)-paramagnetic (PM) transition at Curie<lb/> temperature, T C = 223, 205, 114, and 70 K, for x = 0,<lb/> 0.01, 0.15, 0.2, respectively. The Curie temperature T C ,<lb/> defined as the peak of dM/dT in the M (T) curves, is<lb/> reported for all compositions in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. This table gives<lb/> evidence that T C and the magnetization are sensitive to Fe<lb/> content. Indeed, the increase in Fe content causes an<lb/> increase in T C accompanied by a reduction of the magne-<lb/>tization. Probably, both changes are attributed to the<lb/> competition between the superexchange (Mn 4? -O-Mn 4? )<lb/> and double-exchange (Mn 3? -O-Mn 4? ) interactions. The<lb/> Fe takes place at the Mn site as Fe 3? (replacement of some<lb/> Mn 3? -O-Mn 4? bonds by Mn 4? -O-Fe 3? bonds), giving<lb/> rise to an antiferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Fe<lb/> ions that favors the superexchange mechanism. The evo-<lb/>lution of magnetization (M) versus the applied magnetic<lb/> field (l 0 H) for x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, and 0.2 samples, obtained<lb/> at different temperatures and measured under applied<lb/> magnetic field ranging from 1 to 5 T, is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.<lb/> These curves show that, below the Curie temperature, the<lb/> magnetization greatly increases with the magnetic field and<lb/> the saturated M is reached at H = 1 T. For T [ T C , the<lb/> variation of M (T, l 0 H) does not reach the saturation and a<lb/> linear behavior appears. This result confirms that all sam-<lb/>ples present a typical ferromagnetic behavior.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> presents the magnetization measurements per-<lb/>formed at 4 K under applied magnetic fields of up to 6 T,<lb/> for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0, 0.01, 0.15, 0.2) samples.<lb/> Table 2 lists the experimental and the calculated magnetic<lb/> moments per Mn ion, denoted by M Exp<lb/> Sat and M Theo<lb/> Sat ,<lb/> respectively. The values of M Theo<lb/> Sat have been calculated by<lb/> considering that the spins of all Mn and Fe ions are aligned.<lb/> The magnetic moment of La 3þ<lb/> 0:8 Ca 2þ<lb/> 0:2 Mn 1Àx Fe x<lb/> ð<lb/> Þ 3þ<lb/> 0:8 Mn 4þ<lb/> 0:2 O 3<lb/> is expressed as<lb/></p>

			<p>The magnetic moments of Mn 3? , Mn 4? , and Fe 3? ions<lb/> are l Mn<lb/> 3? = 4l B , l Mn<lb/> 4? = 3l B , and l Fe<lb/> 3? = 5l B , respectively.<lb/> The x is the iron concentration and l B is the Bohr mag-<lb/>neton. We note that the magnetization saturation values<lb/> M Sat decrease with increasing Fe content, especially for<lb/> x = 0.2. It is worth noting that similar results are reported<lb/> in <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>. The difference between the measured and the<lb/> calculated values should be explained by the presence of a<lb/> magnetic inhomogeneity or by spin-canted state at low<lb/> temperature.<lb/></p>

			<p>criterion given by Banerjee <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. It consists in inspecting<lb/> the slope of isotherm plots of l 0 H/M versus M 2 .

			<head>Magnetocaloric study<lb/></head>

			<p>The MCE is defined as the heating or cooling of a magnetic<lb/> material due to the application or suppression of a magnetic<lb/> field, respectively. To estimate the magnetocaloric effect,<lb/> the change of magnetic entropy (DS M ) was calculated<lb/> numerically using the equation <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>:<lb/></p>

				<formula>ÀD S M<lb/> ð Þ ¼<lb/> X ðM i À M iþ1<lb/> T iþ1 À T i<lb/> ÞDH i :<lb/> <label>ð2Þ<lb/></label></formula>

			<p>The M i and M i?1 are the experimental values of mag-<lb/>netization measured at temperatures T i and T i?1 , respec-<lb/>tively. The H i is the applied magnetic field. The magnetic<lb/> entropy change (DS M ) determined numerically using<lb/> Eq. (<ref type="formula">2</ref>) and the M (T, l 0 H) curves are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. The<lb/> (DS M ) value increases with temperature increase to reach a<lb/> maximum near T C and lowers above T c . To compare our<lb/> results with previously published data for other perovskite<lb/> manganites, we listed in Table <ref type="table">3</ref> the data of several mag-<lb/>netic materials that could be used as magnetic refrigerants.<lb/> Also, the maximum magnetic entropy change of Fe-doped<lb/> manganites increases gradually with increasing applied<lb/> magnetic field for such materials. We noted that the max-<lb/>imum entropy change DS max<lb/> M<lb/> corresponding to a magnetic<lb/> field variation of 5 T for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3 and La 0.8 Ca 0.2-<lb/>Mn 0.99 Fe 0.01 O 3 is about 4.42 and 4.32 J/(kg K),<lb/> respectively.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, we compared our performances of MCE<lb/> with those of Gd <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>-based materials as well as rare earth<lb/> manganites. The highest value of the magnetic entropy<lb/> change for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3 and La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 0.99 Fe 0.01 O 3<lb/> samples is observed with x = 0 content and is equal to 1.96<lb/> and 4.42 J/(kg K) under magnetic fields of 1 and 5 T,<lb/> respectively. In addition, similar results were observed by<lb/> Shaobo Xi et al. for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 MnO 3 <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref> and by S.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 6 Arrott curves M 2 versus l 0 H/M for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 samples: a x = 0, b x = 0.01, c x = 0.15, and d x = 0.2<lb/></figure>

			<p>Ghodhbane et al. for Pr 0.8 Ba 0.2 MnO 3 compounds under<lb/> applied magnetic fields of 3 and 1 T, respectively. These<lb/> values are lower than that of pure Gd [2.8 J/(kg K)] in a<lb/> magnetic field change of 1 T <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref> ) and Gd 5 (SixGe 1-x ) 4<lb/> system <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref> which have been considered as good magnetic<lb/> refrigerants. For LCMFe 0.15 and LCMFe 0.2 , the maximum<lb/> value of magnetic entropy change, DS max<lb/> M<lb/>; is 1.6 and<lb/> 0.54 K/(kg K) under a magnetic field of 5 T, respectively.<lb/> Similar results have been reported for La 0.7 Ca 0.15 Sr 0.15-<lb/>Mn 0.9 Fe 0.1 O 3 <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> and La 0.63 Ca 0.33 Mn 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The temperature dependence of the DS M upon the<lb/> magnetic applied field changes of 5 T is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.<lb/> These curves reveal that the La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 (x = 0,<lb/> 0.01) samples present large magnetic entropy change and<lb/> that DS M decreases when increasing the Fe content (x).<lb/> This behavior is understood as the reduction of the double-<lb/>exchange mechanism between Mn 3? and Mn 4? ions for<lb/> La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 samples when x increases.<lb/></p>

			<head>Relative cooling power (RCP)<lb/></head>

			<p>Another useful parameter which examines the efficiency of<lb/> a magnetocaloric material is the RCP or the refrigerant<lb/> capacity. It expresses the heat transfer between the hot and<lb/> the cold reservoirs during an ideal refrigeration cycle. This<lb/> is defined as the product of peak value of change in the<lb/> magnetic entropy and the full width at half maximum<lb/> (FWHM) of DS M versus T curve (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>, inset) <ref type="biblio">[31]</ref>.<lb/></p>

				<formula>RCP ¼ ÀDS max<lb/> M Â dT FWHM<lb/> <label>ð3Þ<lb/></label></formula>

			<p>We have represented in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref> the variation of the RCP<lb/> factor as a function of the applied magnetic field. The RCP<lb/> values exhibit a linear rise with increasing field for LCMO<lb/> and LCMO 0.01 samples. Under the influence of an applied<lb/> field of 5 T, the RCP values are found to be 146 and<lb/> 116 J/kg for the samples x = 0 and 0.01, respectively.<lb/> Similar RCP values at 5 T (RCP = 140 J/kg) have been<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 7 Magnetic entropy change versus temperature for La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 samples at several magnetic applied field changes: a x = 0,<lb/> b x = 0.01, c x = 0.15, and d x = 0.2<lb/></figure>

Another interesting feature in<lb/> the MCE plot is its asymmetric shape, especially under<lb/> high field. Similar behavior is observed in Fe-substituted<lb/> lanthanum calcium manganite <ref type="biblio">[30]</ref>. For comparison, the<lb/> maximum magnetic entropy change, the Curie temperature,<lb/> and the relative magnetic cooling efficiency of several<lb/> manganese perovskites considered useful for room-tem-<lb/>perature magnetic refrigerators are summarized in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.<lb/> Thus, due to the high DS M and RCP values, our compounds<lb/> with x = 0 and 0.01 could be considered as active mag-<lb/>netic refrigerants for near-room-temperature magnetic<lb/> refrigeration.<lb/></p>

			<head>Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>We have studied the structural, magnetic, and magne-<lb/>tocaloric properties of the Fe-doped manganite perovskite<lb/> La 0.8 Ca 0.2 Mn 1-x Fe x O 3 compounds with 0 B x B 0.2. The<lb/> results show that the samples crystallize in the orthorhombic<lb/> structure with Pnma space group. The magnetic properties<lb/> reveal that all samples exhibit a paramagnetic-ferromag-<lb/>netic transition when temperature decreases. From magne-<lb/>tocaloric study, the LCMO and LCMF 0.01 O samples have a<lb/> large magnetic entropy change. The maximum values of the<lb/> magnetic entropy changes decrease with the increase of Fe<lb/> concentration. In addition, due to the high DS M and RCP<lb/> values, Fe-doped manganite perovskite samples can be<lb/> considered a potential refrigerant for use in near-room-<lb/>temperature magnetic refrigeration.</p>
