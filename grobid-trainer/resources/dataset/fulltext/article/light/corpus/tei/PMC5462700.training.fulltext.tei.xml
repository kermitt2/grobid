			<p>Balancing ability is defined as the ability to maintain the body&apos;s center of gravity while minimizing sway in the base of<lb/> support. Postural balance, on the other hand, indicates the ability to continuously retain balance in accordance with the center<lb/> of mass (COM) and movement, and to maintain the proper postural control against actions and external rocking within the<lb/> base of support <ref type="biblio">1, 2)</ref> . Gait training is a common method of improving the balancing ability. It is recommended for aerobic<lb/> capacity improvement, body fat reduction, lowering the blood pressure, improving insulin sensitivity, and improving gait and<lb/> balancing abilities <ref type="biblio">3)</ref> . Research testing the effects of gait training examines types and speed of walking. Underwater walking<lb/> training is special in that it provides a work-out environment of reduced gravity with the use of the buoyancy of water <ref type="biblio">3)</ref> .<lb/> Water workouts relieve stress from weight on the joints, enhances muscular function without imposing excessive impact to<lb/> the muscle, and improves flexibility and balance <ref type="biblio">4)</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Most research has focused on gait training in the ground, and there are very few investigations of underwater walking<lb/> training and its effects on balancing ability <ref type="biblio">3, 4)</ref> . Given this background, this study examines the effects of underwater walking<lb/> training on the healthy subjects balancing ability.<lb/></p>

			<head>SUBJECTS AND METHODS<lb/></head>

			<p>Forty eight subjects (Underwater walking group=25, Overground walking group=23) completed the experiment. The<lb/> characteristics of the two groups (n=48) before and after intervention are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The selection criteria were<lb/> as follows: no history of orthopedic surgery on a lower limb, never taken any drug due to a neurologic problem, and no<lb/> musculoskeletal system disease. In underwater and overground walking training groups average ages, heights, and weights<lb/> were 20.14 ± 1.27, 21.37 ± 1.41 years, 174.16 ± 10.17, 172.54 ± 8.67 cm, and 72.35 ± 6.58, 68.94 ± 7.84 kg, respectively.<lb/> Sufficient explanation of this study&apos;s intent and the overall purpose was given, and voluntary consent to participate in this<lb/> study was obtained from all of the subjects. Information on the study and written informed consent according to the ethical<lb/> standards of the Declaration of Helsinki were provided to all subjects prior to their participation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The trials consisted of underwater and overground walking training. The subjects either walked on an underwater tread-<lb/>mill (HydroTrack ® Underwater Treadmill System, Conray, Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA) or walked on an overground treadmill<lb/> (HL-1100, Healthlife, Korea). The water temperature was set at about 33 °C and the depth was fixed to reach up between the<lb/> subjects&apos; xiphoid process and the navel. The speed of the treadmill was limited to a maximum velocity of 2-4 m/s in both<lb/> groups <ref type="biblio">4)</ref> . The both group consisted of 30-minute walking sessions, five times per week for four weeks.<lb/></p>

			<p>After the intervention, balance measuring equipment (Good Balance, Metitur, Finland) was used to quantitatively measure<lb/> each subject&apos;s balance ability <ref type="biblio">5)</ref> . The balance test was performed by a physical therapist who had completed the course for the<lb/> balance test method and was experienced in clinical practice for over three years. To measure balance function, the subject<lb/> was instructed to stand on a triangle platform and maintain a symmetrical posture with the feet shoulder width apart. A visual<lb/> fixed point was located in front of the subject to minimize head movements. The subject&apos;s arms were placed comfortably<lb/> at the hip joints and the center of pressure (COP) was measured for 30 seconds in the standing posture with the eyes open.<lb/> COP was measured three times and average values were calculated. The software also calculates several variables describing<lb/> the quantitative aspects of individual&apos;s test behaviour, e.g. amount and speed of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway,<lb/> amplitude of sway, the first moment of sway velocity (combined amplitude and velocity of the movement of the center of<lb/> pressure), power spectrum analysis (FFT analysis) etc. Low score of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway implies<lb/> excellent balance ability. The index of balance function score ranges between 0 and 100, and a higher score implies greater<lb/> balance ability to perform the task. A reliable and valid measurement of the functioning of posture control mechanisms is a<lb/> prerequisite for discovering the reasons for balance problems or evaluating the effects of treatment and rehabilitation.<lb/></p>

			<p>The mean and SD were calculated for each variable. Before the intervention, differences in the general characteristics<lb/> of the experimental group were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Variables were compared before and after training within<lb/> experimental group using paired sample t-tests. The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,<lb/> USA), and statistical significance was accepted for p values &lt;0.05<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head>

			<p>The underwater walking training showed significant increases in all variance after intervention (p&lt;0.05). Significant inter-<lb/>group differences in post-training gains were observed for all varience (p&lt;0.05). The effect sizes of gains in the underwater<lb/> and overground walking training were high for medial-lateral and anterior-posterior locus length, balance function indices<lb/> (effect sizes 0.84, 1.11, and 0.96, respectively) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>This study assessed underwater walking training on healthy subjects, and the results showed a positive effect on balancing<lb/> ability. An earlier study found that a stretching exercise increased balancing ability in healthy subjects <ref type="biblio">5)</ref> .When a person moves<lb/> in the water, buoyancy and resistance of the water induce rocking of posture. This body movement activates proprioception<lb/> to maintain upright posture <ref type="biblio">6)</ref> . Movement in the water allows easier application of open and closed kinetic chain exercise than<lb/> on the ground.<lb/></p>

			<p>In the present study, a variable-speed underwater treadmill training with adjustable water depth and frontal resistance<lb/> provided by pump-driven directional water jets has been used as a novel mode of aquatic exercise. This system theoretically<lb/> provides a more favorable mode of exercise for the overweight and obese, in that walking or jogging intensity (velocity and<lb/></p>

			<p>resistance) can be controlled, whereas the buoyancy of water reduces the impact force of ambulation <ref type="biblio">7)</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Other researchers have previously investigated, physical function and walking ability were improved in adults with in-<lb/>complete spinal cord injury following a structured program of underwater treadmill training featuring individualized levels<lb/> of body weight support and carefully staged increases in speed and duration <ref type="biblio">4)</ref> . From a clinical perspective, these findings<lb/> highlight the potential of underwater treadmill training in persons with physical disabilities and diseases that would benefit<lb/> from weight-supported exercise.<lb/></p>

			<p>Underwater walking training provides a treatment environment that is psychologically stable. The physical nature of water<lb/> presents advantages in improving muscular strength and endurance, motion range of joints, increase in cardiopulmonary<lb/> abilities, and improving the quality of life, as gait and balancing ability improve <ref type="biblio">8)</ref> . When adults with arthritis were treated<lb/> with underwater walking training, their balancing ability and motion range of joints improved <ref type="biblio">9)</ref> . It appears that buoyancy,<lb/> temperature, and other qualities of water stimulated proprioception and decreased postural rocking.<lb/></p>

			<p>The underwater treadmill training has been used most frequently as a treatment modality in sports injury or orthopedic<lb/> rehabilitation settings and has only recently been used with obese individuals. Therefore, further clinical controlled studies<lb/> with larger sample sizes and longer interventions should be carried out to validate the clinical benefits of the underwater<lb/> walking.</p>
