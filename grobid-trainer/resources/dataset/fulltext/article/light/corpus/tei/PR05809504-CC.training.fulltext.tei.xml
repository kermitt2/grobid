			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The recent discovery of Iron (Fe)-based oxypnictide superconductor LaFeAs(O 1-x F x ) with its<lb/> superconducting transition temperature (T c ) of 26 K has motivated tremendous interest in scientific<lb/> community <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. The discovery has proposed an alternative perspective for exploring novel high-T c<lb/> superconductors, besides the copper-oxide superconductors, which have been thoroughly investigated<lb/> for more than twenty years. Immediately after the discovery, it was reported that the replacement of La<lb/> by other lanthanide elements (Ln), such as Ce, Sm, Pr, Nd, Gd, Tb significantly improves T c exceeding<lb/> 50 K <ref type="biblio">[2-7]</ref>. Parent compounds LnFeAsO become superconductors through doping of electrons into<lb/> FeAs layers by the partial substitution of F -for O 2-. On the other hand, we have succeeded to<lb/> synthesize oxygen-deficient NdFeAsO 1-y with T c = 54 K using high-pressure synthesis technique <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/> In this case, two electrons are doped by one oxygen defect. Ren et al. independently reported the<lb/> oxygen-deficient system at the same time <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Crystal structure of the oxygen-deficient NdFeAsO 1-y was analyzed by electron diffraction and<lb/> electron microscopy <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. Space group is determined to be P4/nmm (No.129) and the oxygen<lb/> vacancies are concluded as the state of disorder. By using above crystal structure, Rietveld analysis of<lb/> powder neutron diffraction for the series of NdFeAsO 1-y and LaFeAsO 1-y samples were performed <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>.<lb/> The oxygen contents of the samples were estimated and the superconducting phase diagram of<lb/> NdFeAsO1-y is established as a function of the oxygen content for the first time. Moreover, it is found<lb/> that the FeAs4-tetrahedrons transform toward a regular shape with increasing oxygen deficiency. The<lb/> superconducting transition temperatures seem to attain maximum values for regular FeAs4-<lb/>tetrahedrons.<lb/></p>

			<p>The high-pressure synthesis method has advantageous compared to the other techniques as follows.<lb/> We can obtain high-purity samples safely due to a suppression of toxic As evaporation and high-<lb/>density samples due to high-pressure sintering under several GPa. The NdFeAsO 1-y samples were used<lb/> for resistivity measurements under high-pressure <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. As increasing pressure, the transition shows the<lb/> beautiful parallel shift to lower temperatures owing to the high quality and high density of samples.<lb/> Short reaction time typically 2 hours is also helpful to optimize synthesis conditions promptly. This<lb/> technique also versatile for the search of new compounds and we discovered a new superconductor of<lb/> (Ca,Na)Fe 2 As 2 by using this technique <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. In this paper, we report the synthesis of NdFeAsO 1-y , its<lb/> physical properties and electrical phase diagram.<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Experimentals<lb/></head>

			<p>Polycrystalline samples were prepared by using a cubic-anvil-type high-pressure apparatus (Riken<lb/> CAP-07). Powders of Fe, Fe 2 O 3 and a precursor of NdAs were used as starting materials. Note that<lb/> there are no fluorine-containing starting materials, which significantly simplifies the sample synthesis<lb/> process. The precursor of NdAs was obtained by reacting Nd and As chips at 500 °C for 15 hours and<lb/> then 850 °C for 10 hours in an evacuate quarts tube. Assuming that the NdAs and Fe are free from<lb/> oxygen, the starting materials were weighed to the composition ratios of NdFeAsO 1-y . The<lb/> compositions written in this paper are the intended values. We note that the actual oxygen content of<lb/> the obtained NdFeAsO 1-y compounds estimated by neutron diffraction analysis was larger than the<lb/> intended values probably due to oxidation of the NdAs and Fe powders. Oxidation of the sample<lb/> during synthesis process such as the weighing, mixing also may cause as the source of oxygen gain.<lb/> The starting materials were ground with an agate mortar in a glove box filled with dry nitrogen gas.<lb/> The samples were synthesized by heating the mixtures in BN crucibles under a pressure of about 2<lb/> GPa at 1200 °C for 2 hours.<lb/></p>

			<p>Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using CuK a radiation (Rigaku RINT<lb/> 1100). The dc magnetic susceptibility was measured using a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design<lb/> MPMS) under a magnetic field of 5 Oe. The resistivity was measured by a standard four-probe method.<lb/></p>

			<head>3. Results and discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the powder XRD patterns of the samples with the intended oxygen content 1-y=0.90,<lb/> 0.85, 0.80, 0.75 and 0.70. The ZrCuSiAs type crystal structure, as expected for NdFeAsO (and its<lb/> oxygen-deficient form), is formed as the main phase.<lb/></p>

Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples with the intended oxygen content<lb/> 1-y=0.90, 0.85, 0.80, 0.75 and 0.70.<lb/></figure>

			<p>In the XRD pattern of 1-y=0.90 sample, Nd 2 O 3 and FeAs peaks were observed. The real oxygen<lb/> content of 1-y=0.85 sample is estimated 0.96 by the neutron diffraction analysis as mentioned below.<lb/> The actual oxygen content of the starting composition of 1-y=0.90 sample would exceeded 1.0. Lattice<lb/> parameters for 1-y=0.90 and 0.85 samples were almost same, which support above possibility. The<lb/> XRD pattern of 1-y=0.85 and 0.80 samples are almost free from impurity phase, and most of the peaks<lb/> can be indexed on the basis of the tetragonal structure (P4/nmm). The lattice parameters for 1-y=0.85,<lb/> 0.80, 0.75 and 0.70 samples are a=3.9667 and c=8.5757 Å, a=3.9643 and c=8.5636 Å, a=3.9525 and<lb/> c=8.5464 Å, a=3.9488 and c=8.5427 Å, respectively. The a-and c-parameters were contracted with<lb/> decrease in the oxygen content. With decreasing 1-y from 0.75, peaks assigned to NdAs were observed<lb/> to increase.<lb/></p>

			<p>The temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for the 1-y=0.85, 0.80, 0.75 and 0.70<lb/> samples are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The 1-y=0.85 sample did not show superconductivity above 5 K. The<lb/> sharp drop of the magnetic susceptibility, corresponding to the onset of superconductivity is observed<lb/> at around 50 K for 1-y=0.75 and 0.70, both in the zero-field cooling (ZFC) and the field cooling (FC)<lb/> curves. The volume fractions estimated from the magnitude of diamagnetic signal at 5 K are 93 %<lb/> (ZFC) and 26 % (FC) for 1-y=0.70, large enough as bulk superconductivity. We note that the 1-y=0.70<lb/> sample has large magnetic moment above T c , most likely due to some ferromagnetic impurities such as<lb/> Fe 2 O 3 and/or Fe. The 1-y=0.80 sample that is located near the boundary between superconducting state<lb/> and non-superconducting one showed the lower T c of 35 K with a larger transition width and smaller<lb/> volume fraction.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the electronic phase diagram obtained by plotting the a-parameters and T c for the<lb/> samples synthesized so far. The T c is determined from the onset of transition in magnetic susceptibility.<lb/> The upper scale shows the oxygen content 1-y* estimated using the linear fitting (1-y*=6.637a-25.373)<lb/> of the data obtained by the powder neutron diffraction analysis <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. Boundary between<lb/> superconducting state and non-superconducting one is very clear. When the a-parameter is reduced<lb/> from that of non-superconducting sample, superconductivity is induced with an abrupt raise of T c at<lb/> about a=3.964Å (1-y*=0.94) and the T c saturates about 53 K at a=3.94~3.95Å. Ren et al. also shows<lb/> the phase diagram of NdFeAsO 1-δ , where the T c decreases for further shrinkage of the a-parameter<lb/> (~3.92 Å). We have not obtained such samples having lower T c and short a-parameters. They<lb/> synthesized the samples under a pressure of 6 GPa. The higher pressure might have introduced more<lb/> oxygen deficiency, which results in the further shrinkage of the lattice parameters.<lb/></p>

			<head>4. Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>We have successfully synthesized oxygen-deficient, fluorine-free NdFeAsO 1-y superconductors using<lb/> high-pressure technique. Boundary between superconducting state and non-superconducting one is<lb/> distinguished. The a-and c-parameters were contracted with decrease in the oxygen content. The<lb/> superconductivity is induced with an abrupt raise of T c when a-parameter was shrank below 3.964Å<lb/> and the T c saturates about 53 K at a=3.94 ~ 3.95Å.</p>
