			<p>The cellular level of cGMP is controlled by a balance of guanylyl<lb/> cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>. For example, nitric<lb/> oxide (NO) activates soluble guanylyl cyclases to generate cGMP,<lb/> which ultimately causes vasodilation and lowering of blood pressure.<lb/> The cGMP dependent protein kinase PKG is one of the key effectors<lb/> of cGMP signaling <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. Although the physiological roles of<lb/> mammalian PKGs had been extensively studied using genetically<lb/> engineered mice, few molecular targets of PKGs were discovered to<lb/> date that could account for the extensive effect of PKG activation in<lb/> cardiovascular, digestive and nervous systems <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. We study the C.<lb/> elegans PKG ortholog, EGL-4, in order to discover additional<lb/> evolutionarily conserved molecular effectors of cGMP-PKG singaling.<lb/></p>

			<p>Environmental conditions dictate larval developmental decisions<lb/> and a number of adult behaviors such as foraging and egg laying in the<lb/> free living nematode C. elegans. Animals navigate towards food source<lb/> and away from unfavorable growth conditions, such as sub-optimal<lb/> temperature, high population density and pathogenic organisms <ref type="biblio">[4–6]</ref>.<lb/> This is achieved through detection of environmental conditions by<lb/> dedicated sensory neurons and integration of signals in higher order<lb/> neurons, which then instruct physiological and locomotory responses<lb/> via efferent neurons and neuroendocrine signals. In C. elegans, insulin,<lb/> TGF-b and cGMP signaling pathways have been implicated in<lb/> organismal homeostasis in response to changes in environmental<lb/> conditions <ref type="biblio">[7–12]</ref>. While the effectors of insulin and TGF-b pathways<lb/> have been elucidated by genetic and biochemical analysis <ref type="biblio">[13–16]</ref>,<lb/> how cGMP signaling leads to coordinated physiological responses<lb/> throughout the body is poorly understood. It is known that cGMP<lb/> activates cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGs) that alter membrane<lb/> potential of neurons <ref type="biblio">[17–19]</ref>. In addition, cGMP activates cGMP<lb/> dependent protein kinase (PKG), whose downstream effectors that<lb/> mediate coordinated physiological responses to environmental and<lb/> developmental signals have not been identified in C. elegans.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>Mutant alleles of the C. elegans cGMP dependent protein kinase<lb/> EGL-4 were originally identified from a genetic screen for egg<lb/> laying defective mutants <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Subsequently, EGL-4 was found to<lb/> regulate diverse processes such as chemotaxis, olfactory adaptation,<lb/> foraging behavior, body length, dauer arrest and adult life-span<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[21–25]</ref>. It has also been reported that EGL-4 is required for<lb/> behavioral quiescence, in response to food or ectopic epidermal<lb/> growth factor signaling <ref type="biblio">[12,26,27]</ref>. Regulation of foraging behavior<lb/> by PKG appears to be conserved in Drosophila as the expression level<lb/> of the PKG ortholog foraging dictates sitter versus rover phenotype in<lb/> larvae <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>. While EGL-4 acts in sensory neurons to modulate<lb/> foraging behavior <ref type="biblio">[22,24]</ref>, EGL-4 is also expressed throughout the<lb/> body and regulates body length from a number of tissues <ref type="biblio">[29]</ref>.<lb/> Major questions remain regarding how EGL-4 activity is trans-<lb/>duced in different tissues throughout the body. For example, the<lb/> time-scale of various physiological responses following EGL-4<lb/> activation is unknown. In addition, the cytoplasmic versus nuclear<lb/> function of EGL-4, and its molecular effectors in these subcellular<lb/> compartments have not been clearly defined.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The C. elegans EGL-4 is most homologous to mammalian PKG-<lb/>Ib, which has an auto-inhibitory domain at its N-terminus,<lb/> followed by two cGMP binding domains and a kinase domain <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>.<lb/> PKG is normally held inactive by its auto-inhibitory domain and is<lb/> activated through cooperative binding of cGMP, whose level is<lb/> controlled by opposing action of guanylyl cyclase and phospho-<lb/>diesterase <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>. PKG is known to regulate smooth muscle tone in<lb/> response to elevation of cGMP as a result of soluble guanylyl<lb/> cyclase activation by nitric oxide <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref>. A handful of PKG targets<lb/> have been identified that account for the cytoplasmic role of PKG<lb/> in smooth muscles <ref type="biblio">[3,30–32]</ref>. In addition, it has been suggested<lb/> that PKG activity may also affect gene expression in cell culture<lb/> systems <ref type="biblio">[33,34]</ref>. However, the molecular mechanisms that<lb/> underlie nuclear PKG activity are not fully understood.<lb/></p>

			<p>To address how EGL-4 and its downstream effectors may<lb/> coordinate physiological responses upon changes in environmental<lb/> conditions, we characterized a C. elegans mutant that expresses a<lb/> constitutively active EGL-4/PKG. Our analyses revealed genomic<lb/> effects of EGL-4 activity via a conserved histone deacetylase<lb/> complex. We also present evidence that EGL-4 activity can<lb/> modulate the expression of a novel extracellular signaling protein,<lb/> which illustrates how EGL-4 may exert cell non-autonomous effects.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<head>EGL-4/PKG regulates foraging behavior and egg-laying<lb/> rate<lb/></head>

			<p>We isolated mg410, a dominant egl-4 gain-of-function allele from<lb/> a genetic screen for mutants with elevated Nile Red staining in the<lb/> absence of a functional peroxisomal thiolase, kat-1 <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref>. The egl-<lb/>4(mg410) mutant animals display pleiotropic phenotypes such as<lb/> excessive dwelling and reduced body length (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).<lb/> These animals also have elevated egg-laying rate, since they lay<lb/> eggs with embryos younger than the gastrula stage and as early as<lb/> the 8-cell stage (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>) and the number of eggs in their uterus<lb/> is significantly reduced (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Molecular cloning revealed that<lb/> mg410 encoded a single amino acid substitution K162N<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). Lysine 162 in EGL-4 is a key residue of a conserved<lb/> pseudo-substrate motif that was shown to be critical for cGMP<lb/> dependent activation of mammalian PKG <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>. Mutation of the<lb/> pseudo-substrate motif causes constitutive activation of PKG and<lb/> auto-phosphorylation <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>. Accordingly, EGL-4(K162N) under-<lb/>went auto-phosphorylation in the presence or absence of cGMP in<lb/> an in vitro kinase assay (Figure <ref type="figure">1D</ref>). Auto-phosphorylation was not<lb/> detected in the EGL-4(K499A) kinase dead mutant control.<lb/></p>

			<p>To confirm that the mg410 allele, and the corresponding K162N<lb/> substitution, is responsible for the pleiotropic phenotypes associated<lb/> with constitutive activation of EGL-4, we isolated multiple intragenic<lb/> egl-4(mg410) suppressor alleles. Among them, hj32, a null allele that<lb/> encodes a pre-mature stop codon for a complete loss of EGL-4<lb/> protein (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S1A</ref>). The hj32 allele confers strong egl-4<lb/> loss-of-function phenotypes similar to the canonical allele n479 <ref type="biblio">[22]<lb/></ref> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In addition, we identified two weak egl-4 loss-of-function<lb/> alleles, hj33 and hj40. These are missense alleles that encode single<lb/> amino acid substitutions in the EGL-4 kinase domain (Figure <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).<lb/> The egl-4(mg410hj33) and egl-4(mg410hj40) mutant animals are<lb/> phenotypically similar to wild-type animals (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), suggesting that<lb/> these missense alleles confer a partial loss of EGL-4 kinase activity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Foraging behavior and egg laying rate are controlled by<lb/> dedicated neuronal circuits that couple sensory inputs with motor<lb/> outputs. It is plausible that the pleiotropic phenotypes of the egl-4<lb/> gain-of-function (gf) mutant are due to developmental defects of<lb/> specific neuronal circuits. Alternatively, EGL-4 may regulate<lb/> foraging behavior and egg laying frequency by affecting the activity<lb/> of pre-established circuits. To distinguish between these possibilities,<lb/> we transiently expressed a constitutively active (K162N) or kinase<lb/> dead (K499A) form of EGL-4 that carries a FLAG-epitope tag<lb/> under the control of a heat-shock promoter in wild-type animals.<lb/> These animals were allowed to develop to young adult stage when<lb/> all neuronal circuits are established. After heat-shock, the FLAG-<lb/>tagged EGL-4 reached steady-state level in 2 hours and started<lb/> waning after 12 hours (Figure <ref type="figure">1E</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S1B and S1C</ref>). Expression<lb/> level of the FLAG-tagged EGL-4 was comparable to the<lb/> endogenous protein (Figure <ref type="figure">1E</ref>). Using the Worm Tracker program<lb/> for quantitative analysis of foraging behavior <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>, we found no<lb/> significant difference in foraging behavior between wild-type<lb/> animals and animals that expressed constitutively active (hjIs28) or<lb/> kinase dead EGL-4 (hjIs30), 2 hours after heat-shock when the<lb/> expression level of ectopic EGL-4 peaked (Figure <ref type="figure">1F</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S1D</ref>).<lb/> The percentage dwell time of all three strains increased, which<lb/> might be caused by the heat-shock treatment 2 hours prior to our<lb/> measurement. However, ectopic expression of the constitutively<lb/> active EGL-4 (hjIs28) caused excessive dwelling when compared<lb/> with wild-type animals and the kinase dead control (hjIs30) 24 hours<lb/> after heat-shock (Figure <ref type="figure">1F</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S1D</ref>). The excessive dwelling<lb/> was comparable to that of egl-4(gf) mutant animals. The same<lb/> temporal effect was observed on egg laying frequency upon ectopic<lb/> expression of a constitutively active EGL-4 (Figure <ref type="figure">1G</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S1E</ref>).<lb/> We concluded that excessive dwelling and elevated egg laying<lb/> frequency in egl-4(gf) animals were not due to a defect in neuronal<lb/> circuit assembly. Given the delayed effects of EGL-4 activation, we<lb/> hypothesize that EGL-4 may mount a transcriptional program that<lb/> triggers sustained changes on established neuronal circuits.<lb/></p>

			<head>Author Summary<lb/></head>

			<p>Nitrates and phosphodiesterase inhibitors raise the intra-<lb/>cellular level of cGMP, and they have been widely used to<lb/> treat hypertension and erectile dysfunction. Although it is<lb/> known that cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent protein<lb/> kinase PKG, which in turn causes smooth muscle relaxation<lb/> and other physiological responses, very few molecular<lb/> targets of PKG have been identified. In addition, the long-<lb/>term effects of sustained elevation of cGMP and PKG<lb/> activation are not known. We study a family member of PKG<lb/> called EGL-4 in the nematode C. elegans. Using a<lb/> combination of unbiased forward genetic screen and<lb/> proteomic analysis, we show that constitutively active<lb/> EGL-4 alters gene expression in multiple tissues, which is<lb/> achieved through activity-dependent recruitment of a<lb/> conserved Class I histone deacetylase complex in the<lb/> nucleus. Furthermore, we identify a novel EGL-4–responsive<lb/> gene that encodes a putative secreted protein that<lb/> modulates the egg laying rate of C. elegans. Taken together,<lb/> our results uncover novel PKG targets in the nucleus that<lb/> respond to sustained elevation of cGMP. Development of<lb/> chemicals that modulate the activity of these PKG targets<lb/> may differentiate or alleviate undesirable side-effects of<lb/> existing drugs that manipulate cGMP level.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nevertheless, we cannot rule out a role for EGL-4 in regulating<lb/> short-term synaptic activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 act downstream of EGL-4/PKG<lb/></head>

			<p>To identify downstream effectors of the activated EGL-4 kinase,<lb/> we mutagenized egl-4(gf) animals for mutant alleles that suppressed<lb/> their excessive dwelling behavior. These alleles fell into two<lb/> complementation groups, defining two suppressor of activated<lb/> EGL-4 (saeg-) genes. Several lines of evidence suggest that saeg-1 and<lb/> saeg-2 are likely to encode ubiquitous downstream effectors of EGL-<lb/>4. First, recessive mutations in saeg-1 and saeg-2 genes strongly<lb/> suppressed excessive dwelling, accelerated egg laying rate and short<lb/> body length of egl-4(gf) animals (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Second, loss of<lb/> saeg-2 function suppressed the behavioral phenotypes triggered by<lb/> ectopic expression of a constitutively active EGL-4 (Figure <ref type="figure">S1D</ref> and<lb/> S1E). Third, loss of saeg-1 or saeg-2 function did not drastically alter<lb/> egl-4 mRNA levels and more importantly, endogenous EGL-4<lb/> protein level remained constant (Figure <ref type="figure">S2A</ref> and S2B). Since there is<lb/> no phenotypic difference between egl-4(gf); saeg-1, egl-4(gf); saeg-2 and<lb/> egl-4(gf); saeg-1; saeg-2 mutant animals (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), we<lb/> conclude that saeg-1 and saeg-2 act in the same genetic pathway.<lb/></p>
			
			<p>We isolated four recessive alleles of saeg-1. Molecular cloning<lb/> revealed that saeg-1 encodes a C2H2 zinc-finger protein that also<lb/> contains the conserved ELM2 <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref> and SANT domains <ref type="biblio">[39]<lb/></ref> (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). Based on sequence homology and molecular<lb/> architecture, SAEG-1 is orthologous to human transcriptional<lb/> regulating factor 1 (TRERF1; Gene ID: 55809) and zinc-finger<lb/> protein 541 (ZNF541; Gene ID: 84215) <ref type="biblio">[40,41]</ref>. We generated a<lb/> rescuing transgene using 29 kb of genomic sequence that<lb/> encompassed the saeg-1 gene and inserted the green fluorescent<lb/></p>

			<p>protein (GFP) coding sequence immediately 59 to the saeg-1 stop<lb/> codon. We found that SAEG-1::GFP is a ubiquitous nuclear protein<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). The zinc-finger is required for SAEG-1 function<lb/> because animals carrying the hj11 allele, which encodes a leucine<lb/> substitution for one of the zinc coordinating histidines, is<lb/> phenotypically indistinguishable to those carrying the hj12 allele, a<lb/> nonsense allele that causes severe reduction of saeg-1 transcript level.<lb/> We focused our phenotypic analysis on saeg-1(hj12) animals.<lb/></p>

			<p>The saeg-2 gene was defined by a single recessive allele, hj9, from<lb/> our genetic screen. The hj9 allele encodes a guanine to adenine<lb/> substitution that eliminates the consensus splice donor site of the<lb/> third intron. A second allele of saeg-2, ok3174, was isolated by the C.<lb/> elegans Knockout Consortium. Both hj9 and ok3174 alleles are<lb/> molecular null alleles because no SAEG-2 protein is detectable in<lb/> animals carrying either alleles, which show comparable phenotypes<lb/> (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S2C</ref>). The SAEG-2 protein is orthologous to<lb/> mammalian terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase interacting pro-<lb/>tein 1 (Dnttip1; Gene ID: 116092) <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref>. We generated a rescuing,<lb/> single-copy transgene hjSi15 that expressed a SAEG-2::GFP fusion<lb/> protein under the control of the endogenous saeg-2 promoter.<lb/> Similar to SAEG-1::GFP, SAEG-2::GFP is expressed ubiquitously<lb/> and is localized to the nucleus (Figure <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). The nuclear localization<lb/> of SAEG-2::GFP is not dependent on EGL-4 activity (Figure <ref type="figure">S2D</ref>).<lb/> Taken together, our results suggest that SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 are<lb/> nuclear effectors of EGL-4, perhaps by modulating gene expression<lb/> in response to EGL-4 activity. This is consistent with the latent<lb/> manifestation of foraging and egg laying phenotypes upon ectopic<lb/> expression of an activated form of EGL-4.<lb/></p>

			<head>Physical interaction between EGL-4/PKG, SAEG-1, and<lb/> SAEG-2 is conserved<lb/></head>

			<p>We observed that endogenous, wild-type or constitutively active<lb/> EGL-4 kinase is enriched in the nucleus (Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>). Nuclear EGL-<lb/>4::GFP fusion protein has also been observed in most neurons<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[43]</ref>. Given that SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 are nuclear localized<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref> and 2D), we wondered if EGL-4/PKG, SAEG-1 and<lb/> SAEG-2 could physically interact with each other. Indeed, the<lb/> mammalian orthologs of SAEG-1 and SAEG-2, TRERF1 and<lb/> Dnttip1 respectively, have been shown to interact with each other<lb/> in vitro <ref type="biblio">[44]</ref>. We confirmed that SAEG-2 co-immunoprecipitated<lb/> with itself and with SAEG-1, but not the yellow fluorescent protein<lb/> Venus when over-expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>, lanes<lb/> 3 and 4; Figure <ref type="figure">S4A</ref>, lanes 2 and 4). Furthermore, SAEG-1 and<lb/> SAEG-2 specifically co-immunoprecipitated with constitutively<lb/> active or kinase dead forms of EGL-4 in the same over-expression<lb/> system (Figure <ref type="figure">3B</ref>, lanes 5-8, Figure <ref type="figure">S4B</ref>, lanes 8, 10 and 12). We<lb/> also found that the interactions between EGL-4, SAEG-1 and<lb/> SAEG-2 are conserved for their mammalian orthologs (Figure <ref type="figure">3C–<lb/> 3E</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S4C and S4D</ref>). Finally, we tested the interaction<lb/> between endogenous SAEG-2 and EGL-4 when both were<lb/> expressed at physiological level in C. elegans. We found that<lb/> endogenous, activated EGL-4 from egl-4(gf) animals specifically<lb/> associated with SAEG-2 (Figure <ref type="figure">3F</ref>, lane 6). In contrast, there was<lb/> no physical association between SAEG-2 and EGL-4 in its basal<lb/> state as found in wild-type animals under the same experimental<lb/> conditions (Figure <ref type="figure">3F</ref>, lane 5). Our results indicate that EGL-4<lb/> modulates gene expression by recruiting the SAEG-1/SAEG-2<lb/> complex in an activity dependent manner.<lb/></p>

			<head>SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 form a conserved histone<lb/> deacetylase complex<lb/></head>

			<p>Since the interaction between SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 is<lb/> conserved from C. elegans to mammals, we asked whether SAEG-<lb/>1 and SAEG-2 and their mammalian orthologs are part of a larger<lb/> protein complex that mediates EGL-4/PKG activity. We<lb/> established human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines that stably<lb/></p>

In addition, we found that histone deacetylase 1<lb/> (HDAC1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) were the only<lb/> proteins that consistently associated with both ZNF541 and<lb/> Dnttip1. We verified the interaction between HDAC1, ZNF541<lb/> and Dnttip1 (Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>, lanes 4 and 8) and concluded that<lb/> ZNF541 and Dnttip1 are components of a novel histone<lb/> deacetylase complex. The C. elegans HDA-2 is the closest ortholog<lb/> of mammalian HDAC1 and HDAC2 and it co-immunoprecipi-<lb/>tated with SAEG-2 when over-expressed in Drosophila S2 cells<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">4C</ref>, lane 2). However, we did not detect significant<lb/> association between SAEG-1 and HDA-2 (YAH and HYM,<lb/> unpublished data). It is plausible that SAEG-2 serves as an anchor<lb/> by simultaneously interacting with SAEG-1 and HDA-2.<lb/></p>

			<p>If the association of HDA-2 with SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 is<lb/> required to mediate EGL-4 activity, then a loss of hda-2 function<lb/> should mimic the loss of saeg-1 or saeg-2. Indeed, loss of hda-2<lb/> function partially suppressed the excessive dwelling, accelerated<lb/> egg laying and short body length phenotypes of egl-4(gf) animals<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">4D and 4E</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Suppression of egl-4(gf) phenotypes<lb/> by loss of hda-2 function could be reversed with an hda-2p::hda-2(+)<lb/> transgene, demonstrating the specificity of such genetic interaction<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">4D and 4E</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Furthermore, loss of hda-3 or hda-4,<lb/> which encodes two closely related histone deacetylases, failed to<lb/> suppress the egl-4(gf) phenotypes (<ref type="figure">Figure 4E</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Taken<lb/> together, our results suggest that SAEG-1, SAEG-2 and HDA-2<lb/> form a histone deacetylase complex that is a nuclear effector of<lb/> EGL-4 activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>Regulation of egg-laying rate by an EGL-4–responsive<lb/> gene<lb/></head>

			<p>Our results point to a molecular pathway in which activated<lb/> EGL-4/PKG kinase engages a conserved histone deacetylase<lb/> complex that modulates expression of key regulators of foraging<lb/> behavior and egg laying rate. We hypothesized that such EGL-4<lb/> activity responsive genes are most likely repressed in egl-4(gf)<lb/> animals in a SAEG-1/SAEG-2 dependent manner. These genes<lb/> should also be de-repressed or activated in egl-4(lf) animals.<lb/> Therefore, we performed gene expression profiling using Affyme-<lb/>trix microarrays on RNA samples extracted from wild-type, egl-<lb/>4(gf), egl-4(lf) and egl-4(gf); saeg-1(lf) mutant animals at the late<lb/> larval L4 and young adult stage. By focusing on genes that showed<lb/> .1.5-fold change in expression (p,0.05) when compared with<lb/> wild-type samples, we identified 60 genes that were repressed in<lb/> egl-4(gf) and activated in egl-4(lf) animals (Figure <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). The<lb/> expression of 43 out of these 60 genes was normalized close to<lb/> wild-type level (,1.5-fold change) in egl-4(gf); saeg-1(lf) animals. In<lb/> addition, 5 out of these 60 genes were de-repressed and activated<lb/> (.1.5-fold) in the same animals. These results demonstrate that<lb/> EGL-4 modulates gene expression almost entirely through SAEG-<lb/>1, and by inference the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 complex. Although we<lb/> have identified a group of genes whose expression was highly<lb/> responsive to EGL-4 activity, our results did not imply direct<lb/> recruitment of the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 complex to their promoters.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>We focused our analysis on Y45F10C.2 as an EGL-4 activity<lb/> responsive gene because it showed the maximal differential<lb/> expression in egl-4(gf) versus egl-4(lf) animals (Figure <ref type="figure">5B</ref>). Further-<lb/>more, Y45F10C.2 expression is de-repressed in egl-4(gf); saeg-1(lf)<lb/> animals. We verified the gene expression changes in Y45F10C.2<lb/> by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure <ref type="figure">5C</ref>). The Y45F10C.2 gene<lb/> encodes a novel protein with a predicted secretory peptide and it<lb/> belongs to the DUF1505 family whose members contain 6 highly<lb/> conserved cysteine residues. A duplicate of Y45F10C.2,<lb/> C08F11.12, was found 10 kb away from its 39 end. The<lb/> Y45F10C.2 and C08F11.12 genes differ by a single nucleotide<lb/> polymorphism in the coding sequence and their 59 intergenic<lb/> regulatory sequences are .98% identical over ,775 bp. Our<lb/> microarray and real-time PCR analysis allowed us to monitor the<lb/> expression changes in both genes simultaneously and we found<lb/> that the two genes had similar function (NXU and HYM,<lb/> unpublished data). For simplicity, we will use Y45F10C.2 as a<lb/> representative gene name hereafter.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The expression level of Y45F10C.2 closely correlated with the<lb/> egg laying phenotype of our allelic series of egl-4 mutant animals<lb/> and by extension the EGL-4 activity (Figure <ref type="figure">5C</ref>). Mild elevation of<lb/> egg-laying rate in saeg-1 or saeg-2 single mutant animals also<lb/> correlated well with a ,2-fold reduction of Y45F10C.2 expression<lb/> level (Figure <ref type="figure">5C</ref>). Using a bi-cistronic transgene in which<lb/> Y45F10C.2 and GFP expression were under the control of the<lb/> Y45F10C.2 promoter, we found that the promoter was most active<lb/> in the uterine epithelium (Figure <ref type="figure">5E</ref>). It is plausible that EGL-4<lb/> regulates Y45F10C.2 in a cell-autonomous manner, since<lb/> endogenous nuclear EGL-4 was detected in uterine epithelial cells<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">S5</ref>).<lb/></p>
			
			<p>Over-expression of Y45F10C.2 also caused a severe reduction<lb/> in egg-laying rate and retention of fertilized eggs, a phenotype<lb/> shared by egl-4(lf) animals where Y45F10C.2 expression was high<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">5D and 5E</ref>). The egg-laying phenotype triggered by<lb/> Y45F10C.2 over-expression was specific because substitution of a<lb/> highly conserved cysteine with alanine (Cys36Ala) in Y45F10C.2<lb/> abolished its ability to promote egg retention (Figure <ref type="figure">5D and 5F</ref>).<lb/> We note that Y45F10C.2 may be sufficient but not necessary for<lb/> modulating egg-laying rate, because knock-down by RNA<lb/> interference (RNAi) did not affect egg-laying in wild-type animals,<lb/> perhaps due to functional compensation by other DUF1505 family<lb/> members (NXU and HYM, unpublished data). Finally, the<lb/> Y45F10C.2 transgene was not expressed in egl-4(gf) animals,<lb/> consistent with the observation that the endogenous Y45F10C.2<lb/> gene was highly repressed in these animals (Figure <ref type="figure">5G</ref>). Our results<lb/> suggest that Y45F10C.2 is a target gene that regulates egg laying in<lb/> response to EGL-4 activity and it may act in parallel of other<lb/> EGL-4 effectors and the neuronal circuit that controls vulval<lb/> muscles contraction.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>In this paper, we combine genetic, proteomic and genomic<lb/> approaches to determine how a cGMP dependent protein kinase,<lb/> EGL-4, modulates gene expression. Activated EGL-4 preferen-<lb/>tially associates with a conserved SAEG-1/SAEG-2 histone<lb/></p>

			<p>deacetylase complex, which in turn represses a novel gene that<lb/> regulates egg-laying rate (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Our results demonstrate that<lb/> in additional to cytoplasmic roles in Drosophila and mammals<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[3,46]</ref>, cGMP dependent kinase can act in the nucleus to elicit<lb/> long-term transcriptional changes that affect multiple physiological<lb/> processes such as foraging behavior, egg laying rate and body<lb/> length in C. elegans.<lb/></p>

			<p>We propose that EGL-4 plays a central role in linking sensory<lb/> input regarding environmental conditions to long-term physiolog-<lb/>ical responses by altering gene expression of intracellular and<lb/> extracellular signaling molecules. Although nuclear function of<lb/> EGL-4 and mammalian PKG had been suggested in the past, in<lb/> part through the demonstration of EGL-4/PKG nuclear translo-<lb/>cation <ref type="biblio">[33,43,47]</ref>, the effectors of nuclear EGL-4/PKG activity in<lb/> vivo had been ill-defined. Given the ubiquitous expression of EGL-<lb/>4, SAEG-1 and SAEG-2, and the requirement of SAEG-1 and<lb/> SAEG-2 by EGL-4 in multiple physiological processes, our results<lb/> support a model in which the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 complex mediates<lb/> EGL-4 activity in the nucleus in diverse tissues. Nevertheless, we<lb/> noted that loss of saeg-1 or saeg-2 function was not equivalent to a<lb/> complete loss of egl-4 function (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). This suggests that EGL-4<lb/> activity can be mediated by alternative nuclear or cytoplasmic<lb/> pathways in parallel of SAEG-1 and SAEG-2 (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). For<lb/> example, EGL-4 has been reported to modulate gene expression of<lb/> two chemosensory receptors, str-1 and str-3, through inhibition of<lb/> the histone deacetylase HDA-4 <ref type="biblio">[48]</ref>. It is plausible that EGL-4<lb/> engages different histone deacetylase complexes in a context<lb/> dependent manner.<lb/></p>
			
			<p>We took a non-biased genomic approach to identify EGL-4<lb/> activity responsive genes. Based on our model, we reasoned that<lb/> such genes should be repressed upon EGL-4 activation in a<lb/> SAEG-1/SAEG-2 complex dependent manner. In addition to<lb/> Y45F10C.2, which regulates egg laying rate, we also identified a<lb/> group of genes that are involved in lipid metabolism, lipid and<lb/> sugar transport, and extracellular signaling (Figure <ref type="figure">5B</ref>; YAH,<lb/> LCH and HYM, unpublished data). Our results are consistent<lb/> with the observation that alteration in PKG activity in Drosophila<lb/> also led to changes in lipid and carbohydrate storage and<lb/> metabolism <ref type="biblio">[49]</ref>.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>How does EGL-4 regulate egg-laying has been an open question<lb/> since the original isolation of egl-4 mutants almost 30 years ago<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Although the neuronal circuit that controls egg-laying<lb/> muscles is well-defined <ref type="biblio">[50–52]</ref>, additional mechanisms have been<lb/> proposed to modulate egg-laying rate in response to environmen-<lb/>tal stimuli. EGL-4 may be involved in the latter since<lb/> pharmacological studies failed to assign a role for EGL-4 in the<lb/> neuronal circuit that controls the egg-laying muscles or at the<lb/> muscles themselves <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Here, we provide experimental evidence<lb/> that EGL-4 controls egg-laying, at least in part, by modulating the<lb/> expression of Y45F10C.2, a putative secreted protein from the<lb/> uterine epithelium. The DUF1505 family, to which Y45F10C.2<lb/> belongs, appears to have undergone expansion through gene<lb/> duplication in C. elegans. However, Y45F10C.2 and its duplicate,<lb/> C08F11.12 are the only family members whose expression is<lb/> regulated by EGL-4 activity (NXU and HYM, unpublished data).<lb/> The molecular target of Y45F10C.2 is unknown. It is plausible<lb/> that Y45F10C.2 can bind to novel cell surface receptors that<lb/> inhibit egg laying or modulate the function of serotonin,<lb/> acetylcholine or neuropeptide receptors at the neuromuscular<lb/> circuit for egg laying.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>Our results support a surprising in vivo role for the mammalian<lb/> orthologs of SAEG-1 and SAEG-2. In cell culture systems,<lb/> TRERF1 has been reported to activate CYP11A1, a gene required<lb/> for steroidogenesis <ref type="biblio">[41]</ref>. TRERF1 also interacts with Dnttip1 and<lb/> together, they have been implicated in V(D)J recombination by<lb/> antagonizing the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) <ref type="biblio">[44]</ref>.<lb/> Another SAEG-1 ortholog, ZNF541, has been implicated in<lb/> chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis in mice <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>. While<lb/> it is hard to reconcile such diverse functions of TRERF1, ZNF541<lb/> and Dnttip1, our results implicate that together with HDAC1 or<lb/> HDAC2, TRERF1 and Dnttip1 may constitute a PKG effector<lb/> complex in tissues where they are co-expressed, such as the<lb/> olfactory bulb in mice (Allen Brain Atlas). Notably, EGL-4 is<lb/> known to be required for chemotaxis and olfactory adaptation in<lb/> sensory neurons in C. elegans <ref type="biblio">[21,24]</ref>. It is plausible that PKG may<lb/> modulate gene expression in the olfactory bulb via the TRERF1/<lb/> Dnttip1/HDAC complex upon olfactory stimulation.<lb/></p>

			<p>While the intracellular cGMP level is tightly regulated by the<lb/> opposing action of guanylyl cyclase (GC) and phosphodiesterase<lb/> (PDE) physiologically <ref type="biblio">[1,2]</ref>, NO-releasing organic nitrates and<lb/> PDE inhibitors have been developed to increase cGMP level<lb/> pharmacologically <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. This is because the NO-cGMP-PKG<lb/> pathway is critical for relaxation of smooth muscles and<lb/> activation of this pathway provides effective therapy for erectile<lb/> dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension and potentially other<lb/> diseases associated with abnormal smooth muscle tone. Despite<lb/> the wide spread use of nitrates and PDE inhibitors, little is known<lb/> about the effects of sustained elevation of cGMP level and<lb/> presumably prolonged activation of PKG. Our results suggest<lb/> that the potential genomic effects of PKG activation should be<lb/> considered when administering nitrates and PDE inhibitors.<lb/> Furthermore, the conserved SAEG-1/SAEG-2 histone deacety-<lb/>lase complex represents new molecular targets for the develop-<lb/>ment of chemicals that specifically target cytoplasmic versus<lb/> nuclear PKG activity.<lb/></p>

			<p>In summary, our results provide a molecular framework on how<lb/> nuclear EGL-4/PKG activity triggers wide-spread physiological<lb/> responses. In C. elegans, we expect to identify additional EGL-4<lb/> responsive genes that regulate foraging behavior and body length.<lb/> It is plausible that the SAEG-1/SAEG-2 histone deacetylase<lb/> complex may engage tissue specific transcription factors, which<lb/> may be identified through isolation of tissue specific genetic<lb/> suppressors of the egl-4(gf) mutant. Given the deep conservation of<lb/> EGL-4, SAEG-1 and SAEG-2, our model should be readily<lb/> applicable in mammals and expand the mode of action of cGMP<lb/> signaling and its downstream kinase PKG.<lb/></p>

			<head>Genetic screens<lb/></head>

			<p>The egl-4(mg410) allele was isolated in a previously described<lb/> genetic screen for mutants that enhanced Nile Red staining of<lb/> kat-1(mg368) mutant animals <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref>. Using a SNP-based<lb/> mapping strategy with the Hawaiian C. elegans isolate<lb/> CB4856 <ref type="biblio">[53,54]</ref>, we mapped mg410 to LGIV between<lb/> snp_Y38C1BA<ref type="biblio">[2]</ref> and snp_pkP4053. Based on annotation of<lb/> the eight genes in this region, we chose to sequence all exons<lb/> and exon/intron junction of egl-4 and identified a single G to T<lb/> mutation that introduced a K162N (residue numbering as in<lb/> EGL-4A) substitution in animals carrying the mg410 allele.<lb/> This mutation is located in a common exon shared by isoforms<lb/> a, b, c, and e of egl-4.<lb/></p>

			<p>To isolate genetic suppressors of egl-4(mg410), we mutagenized<lb/> egl-4(mg410) animals with ethyl methane-sulfonate (EMS) by using<lb/> standard procedures. We screened 34,000 haploid genomes and<lb/> retrieved both intragenic and extragenic suppressors of egl-4(mg410),<lb/> which displayed an increase in body length and roaming behavior.<lb/> Intragenic suppressors are egl-4 loss-of-function alleles, including<lb/> hj32, hj33 and hj40. In addition, we isolated extragenic suppressor<lb/> alleles that fell into two complementation groups. Genetic mapping<lb/> with the Hawaiian isolate CB4856 placed saeg-2(hj9) on LGIII<lb/> between snp_F54F2[1] and snp_pkP3051. Cosmid rescue and<lb/> candidate gene sequencing identified a g to a mutation in the splice<lb/> donor site of the third intron in T23G5.6. Expression of SAEG-<lb/>2::GFP under the control of saeg-2 promoter from a single copy<lb/> transgene (hjSi15) also rescued egl-4(mg410); saeg-2(ok3174) animals.<lb/> However, over-expression of SAEG-2::GFP from extra-chromo-<lb/>somal transgenes failed to do so. We mapped saeg-1(hj11) to LGV<lb/> between snp_T21C9[2] and snp_pkP5065. Of the candidate genes<lb/> we sequenced in this interval, we found mutations in F53H10.2 in<lb/> hj11, hj12, hj15 and hj16 and we rescued animals carrying hj12 by<lb/> injecting the fosmid WRM062aH08, which contained only the<lb/> coding and regulatory sequences of F53H10.2. We used hj12 as the<lb/> reference allele, which introduced a pre-mature stop codon in place<lb/> of Arg615 (residue numbering as in SAEG-1A) and an 80%<lb/> decrease in mRNA level as measured by quantitative real-time PCR<lb/> (YAH and HYM, unpublished data).<lb/></p>

			<head>Heat-shock experiments<lb/></head>

			<p>Heat-shock experiments were performed with synchronized<lb/> wild-type, hjIs28 and hjIs30 young adult animals as judged by<lb/> vulval morphology. Animals were raised at 20uC on NGM agar<lb/> plates seeded with OP50 and were heat shocked for 30 mins at<lb/> 33uC, before returning to 20uC for defined periods of time. 50<lb/> animals were picked at each time point for detection of EGL-4<lb/> protein by Western blotting.<lb/></p>

			<head>Antibodies<lb/></head>

			<p>Antibodies against EGL-4 were raised in rabbits using a GST-EGL-<lb/>4A(32-215) fusion protein. EGL-4A(32-215) encompasses the auto-<lb/>inhibition domain, which is also present in EGL-4 isoforms B, C and E.<lb/> Antibodies against SAEG-2 were raised in rabbits using full-length<lb/> SAEG-2 fused to the Pseudomonas Endotoxin at the N-terminus and a<lb/> poly-histidine tag at the C-terminus. Monoclonal antibodies against the<lb/> FLAG epitope (clone M2; Sigma) and HA epitope (clone 3F10; Roche)<lb/> were used for Western blot. For immunoprecipitation, anti-FLAG<lb/> (clone M2; Sigma) and anti-HA (clone HA-7; Sigma) antibodies<lb/> conjugated to agarose beads were used.<lb/></p>
