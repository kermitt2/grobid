			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>The transcription factor FOXM1 is overexpressed and amplified in<lb/> many types of cancers and is a master regulator of cancer cell<lb/> division, aggressiveness, and metastasis. <ref type="biblio">1-8</ref> FOXM1 activity<lb/> promotes all of the hallmarks of cancer, stimulating cell<lb/> proliferation, genome instability, angiogenesis, and suppressing<lb/> cell senescence. <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> FOXM1 action is also associated with<lb/> resistance to endocrine therapies in estrogen receptor (ER)-<lb/>positive breast cancers and with resistance to radiation and many<lb/> chemotherapies in several subtypes of breast cancer, and as well<lb/> in many other cancers. <ref type="biblio">6,11-15</ref> We have shown that FOXM1<lb/> increases the cancer stem cell population, drives proliferation,<lb/> motility and invasiveness, and therapy resistance, and we found<lb/> that knockdown of FOXM1 in breast cancer cells could restore<lb/> sensitivity to endocrine therapy. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Hence, targeting FOXM1<lb/> activity is of great importance and could benefit many patients<lb/> whose tumors are being driven by FOXM1. To meet this clinical<lb/> need, we have therefore focused on the development of<lb/> compounds to suppress FOXM1 activities.<lb/></p>

			<p>In our search for regulators of FOXM1 activity, we assayed<lb/> various members of a local chemical library for their inhibition of<lb/> breast cancer cell proliferation and expression of FOXM1-signature<lb/> genes, and we obtained a number of initial hits that were then<lb/> expanded to a family of 1,1-diarylethylene mono and diamines,<lb/> and their corresponding methiodide salts. These compounds were<lb/> studied further to verify their direct target engagement with<lb/> FOXM1, and structural modifications were made to improve their<lb/> cellular potency and efficacy, and their in vivo activity.<lb/></p>

			<p>Here, we report on the FOXM1 inhibitory activity of these<lb/> compounds in cell-free and cell-based assays, and in in vivo<lb/> preclinical breast tumor models. The compounds bind directly to<lb/> FOXM1 and affect FOXM1 stability, decrease the cellular level of<lb/> FOXM1, effectively suppress proliferation and increase apoptosis<lb/> of FOXM1-containing human breast cancer cells, and block the<lb/> expression of FOXM1-regulated genes. One of the compounds<lb/> had good oral efficacy in suppressing the growth of FOXM1-<lb/>containing breast tumors in NOD-SCID-gamma (NSG) mice, and<lb/> several others had good efficacy in tumor suppression by<lb/> subcutaneous administration. Our findings identify and character-<lb/>ize a new class of compounds that effectively antagonize FOXM1<lb/> actions and tumor growth, and may be suitable for further clinical<lb/> evaluation in targeting aggressive breast cancers driven<lb/> by FOXM1.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head> 

			<head>Effects of compounds on proliferation of a panel of breast cells<lb/></head>

			<p>The 1,1-diarylethylene compounds we have studied are shown in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>. They were obtained after FOXM1 target engagement<lb/> verification and structural optimization of initial hits from a local<lb/> chemical library that were identified through cell-based assays of<lb/> inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and FOXM1-regulated<lb/> gene expression, described below. The set of compounds is<lb/> composed of one monoamine and four diamines, in each case<lb/> with the corresponding methiodide salt that was used to optimize<lb/> their in vivo properties.<lb/></p>

			<p>We used a panel of human breast cancer cell lines and the non-<lb/>tumorigenic MCF10A breast cell line that differed in their FOXM1<lb/> protein content (high to intermediate levels, DT22, MCF7, T47D,<lb/> BT474, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231 cells; and<lb/> low level, MCF10A cells) to examine the effects of potential<lb/> FOXM1 inhibitor compounds on cell proliferation. All cell lines are<lb/> ER-negative except for MCF7, T47D, and BT474 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). As<lb/> seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>, where we monitored the effects of the earliest lead<lb/> compound, the monoamine NB-55, we found that cells with high<lb/> or intermediate levels of FOXM1 protein showed relatively similar<lb/> dose-responses for inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas<lb/> MCF10A, with a low level of FOXM1, showed a reduced sensitivity<lb/> to NB-55, requiring a concentration of NB-55 five times higher to<lb/> achieve equal 50% suppression of proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Because the IC 50 for inhibition of proliferation by the mono-<lb/>amine NB-55 was only ca. 2-10 µM in the breast cancer cell lines,<lb/> we compared NB-55 with some members of the diamine series<lb/> (NB-51, 55, 65, 70, 72), as well as with their methiodide salts (NB-<lb/>63, 68, 71, 73, 115), for possible improved potency. In these<lb/> studies, we also used the FOXM1 inhibitor FDI-6 <ref type="biblio">16</ref> as a comparator<lb/> compound (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d, e</ref>). Notably, all of the diamines were markedly<lb/> more potent than the monoamine NB-55 and also FDI-6 in<lb/> suppressing cell proliferation in both ER-negative DT22 cells and<lb/> ER-positive MCF7 cells. In these cell assays, the methiodide salts,<lb/> whether of the monoamine (NB-63) or the diamines (NB-68, 71,<lb/> 73, 115), had potencies very similar to those of their parent amine<lb/> compounds. Dose-response antiproliferative studies in additional<lb/> cell lines beyond the ER-positive MCF7 and the basal/claudin low<lb/> triple negative DT22 cells gave similar findings. Thus, in triple<lb/> negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, IC 50<lb/> values for the monoamine NB-55 were 3-5 µM, whereas the<lb/> diamines and their methiodide salts gave IC 50 values of 0.6 ±<lb/> 0.14 µM, very similar to those observed with MCF7 and DT22 cells.<lb/> Of interest, the diamine salt tested, NB-73, also effectively<lb/> suppressed the proliferation of tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 breast<lb/> cancer cells, whose growth was weakly stimulated rather than<lb/> suppressed by trans-hydroxytamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). <ref type="biblio">17<lb/></ref></p>

		    <p>Analysis of gene expression using NB-55, NB-73, NB-115, and<lb/> FDI-6 for comparison, at their IC 50 concentration for suppression<lb/> of cell proliferation, showed that they significantly reduced the<lb/> expression of classic FOXM1 stimulated target genes <ref type="biblio">15,18,19<lb/></ref> (FOXM1C, AURKB, CCNB1, and PLK1) and increased expression<lb/> of ATF3, a gene suppressed by FOXM1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Direct binding of compounds to FOXM1 and increased<lb/> FOXM1 sensitivity to proteolysis upon compound binding<lb/> </head>

			<p>We used two approaches to investigate whether these antipro-<lb/>liferative compounds were engaging FOXM1 directly. First, we<lb/> developed a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy trans-<lb/>fer (tr-FRET) assay for direct FOXM1 binding. We adapted the<lb/> diamine compound NB-72 to create an acceptor fluorophore Fl-<lb/>NB-72 by replacing one amine appendage with fluorescein, and<lb/> we attached a terbium donor to purified, full length FOXM1<lb/> through a streptavidin-biotin linker. FOXM1 titrations showed that<lb/> Fl-NB-72 bound to the FOXM1 protein with high affinity (K d =<lb/> 23 nM) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>The FOXM1 interaction of the ten compounds we had studied<lb/> were assessed by a competition assay, monitoring the decrease in<lb/> FRET signal as a fixed concentration of Fl-NB-72 was displaced by<lb/> increasing concentrations of compound. Representative examples<lb/> are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>. The K i values, calculated from the IC 50 values,<lb/> are given for all compounds in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. The mono<lb/> and diamines and their methiodide salts have high binding affinity<lb/> for FOXM1, with K i values in the submicromolar range; the<lb/></p>

RNA was extracted from cells and expression of different genes was monitored by qRT-PCR. Assays were run in<lb/> triplicate. Values are mean ± SEM. *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001.<lb/></figure>

			<p>methiodide salts of the diamines bind with higher affinity than the<lb/> diamines themselves.<lb/></p>

			<p>We also examined the effect of these compounds on the level<lb/> of intracellular FOXM1 and on the proteolytic lability of FOXM1 in<lb/> cell extracts. Treatment of cell extracts with NB-73 rendered the<lb/> FOXM1 protein more readily proteolyzed by pronase (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>),<lb/> suggesting that binding of compound to FOXM1 destabilizes its<lb/> structure and increases the ease with which it can be degraded by<lb/> pronase. Likewise, exposure of cells (MDA-MB-231 or MCF7) to NB-<lb/>55, NB-73, or NB-115 reduced the intracellular level of FOXM1<lb/> over time (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d, e</ref>), whereas the intracellular level of a different<lb/> forkhead protein, FOXA1, was not altered by these compounds (<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>). Of interest, intracellular FOXM1 protein level was<lb/> minimally affected by FDI-6 exposure of cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>), suggesting<lb/> that our compounds and FDI-6 have somewhat different<lb/> mechanisms of action. Also, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2f</ref>, cotreatment of<lb/> cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 reversed the down-<lb/>regulation of cellular FOXM1 by NB-73.<lb/></p>

			<head>RNA-Seq analysis of the effects of compounds and of siFOXM1 on<lb/> global FOXM1 gene regulation<lb/> </head>

			<p>We next used RNA-Seq to examine the effects of these<lb/> compounds on gene regulation more globally. Because full<lb/> FOXM1 depletion results in mitotic catastrophe and cell death, <ref type="biblio">20<lb/></ref> we used concentrations of compounds that suppressed cell<lb/> proliferation by about 60%. As seen in the heat maps in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>,<lb/> NB-73 regulated FOXM1 RNA-signature genes at 9 h and even<lb/> more strongly at 24 h in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, as<lb/> shown in the Venn diagram (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>), there was extensive overlap<lb/> in the genes regulated more than 2-fold and with FDRs &lt; 0.05 by<lb/> NB-73, NB-55, and FDI-6. Notably, 72% of genes regulated by NB-<lb/>55 and 48% of genes regulated by FDI-6 overlapped with NB-73<lb/></p>

Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) and<lb/> Enrichment Scores for gene regulations by NB-73 or siFOXM1<lb/> treatment of cells are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>. These analyses testing the<lb/> differential gene expression data against gene sets consisting of<lb/> FOXM1 target genes revealed negative enrichment scores,<lb/> indicating that NB-73 and siFOXM1 downregulate expression of<lb/> genes in the FOXM1 cistrome. The major categories of gene<lb/> regulations, identified by Gene Ontology analysis and shown in<lb/> the reduce and visualize gene ontologies (REVIGO) plots (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d<lb/></ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), included proliferation, G2/M transition<lb/> of mitotic cell cycle, apoptosis, regulation of transcription, DNA<lb/> replication and DNA repair, activities well known to be under<lb/> FOXM1 regulation. <ref type="biblio">21<lb/></ref> </p>

			<head>Effects of compounds on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and on nuclear<lb/> localization of FOXM1<lb/> </head>

			<p>As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>, the compounds had a marked effect on the cell<lb/> cycle and also on the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis. In<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 4 Compound NB-73 increases the percent of cells in G2/M and reduces the percent of cells in S phase of the cell cycle, and increases<lb/> apoptosis, but does not change the nuclear localization of the FOXM1 present. a MDA-MB-231 cells were synchronized by double thymidine<lb/> block and were released for 24 h with or without treatment with vehicle or NB-73 (at 1.5, 3.0, or 4.5 µM). The percent of cells in different<lb/> phases of the cell cycle were monitored by flow cytometry. n = 4 experiments, mean + SD. b Cells were treated with or without NB-73 (at 1.5<lb/> or 3 µM) for 24 h or 72 h and the percent of apoptotic cells was monitored by AnnexinV/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. n = 3<lb/> experiments, mean + SD. c Caspase 3/7 activity was monitored after cell treatment with or without NB-73 (at 1.5 or 3 µM) for 24 h using<lb/> Caspase Glo assay. n = 2 experiments, mean + SD; t-test **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001. d NB-73 treatment (2 µM for 24 h) of MDA-MB-231 cells results<lb/> in a decrease of p-FOXM1, observed by immunofluorescent staining (Scale bar = 50 µm). Nuclei from four fields for vehicle and NB-73 treated<lb/> cells were analyzed using the Image J fluorescent analysis tool, the average CTCF (corrected total cell fluorescence) was calculated, and data<lb/> were statistically analyzed by paired t-test. e Treatment with NB-55, NB-73, or NB-115 or FDI6 for 24 h does not change the intracellular<lb/> localization of FOXM1, which remains largely nuclear, as observed by Western blot of nuclear extracts (NE) and cytoplasmic extracts (CE) of<lb/> cells after 24 h. By contrast, β-Actin is largely in the CE, as expected.<lb/></figure>

			<p>Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>, cells were synchronized by double thymidine block and<lb/> were then released for 24 h with or without treatment with NB-73<lb/> at three different concentrations (1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 µM). Flow<lb/> cytometry analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref> and Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure">3 and 4</ref>)<lb/>showed that compound treatment resulted in a large increase in<lb/> the percent of cells in G2/M, and decrease in the percent of cells in<lb/> S phase, consistent with the compounds inhibiting FOXM1<lb/> activity. <ref type="biblio">9,22</ref> FOXM1 is a key regulator of G1/S and G2/M transitions<lb/> and M phase progression and FOXM1 binds to many G2/M<lb/> promoters. <ref type="biblio">8,9</ref> Treatment with NB-73 also increased the percent of<lb/> apoptotic cells observed at 24 h or 72 h (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>) and caspase 3/7<lb/> activity (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Of note, treatment with NB-73 decreased the expression of<lb/> phospho-FOXM1, considered the biologically active form of<lb/> FOXM1, as observed by immunofluorescence (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>), consistent<lb/> with western blot findings in Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>, e that NB-73 treatment<lb/> decreased FOXM1. Despite the change in amount of FOXM1<lb/> protein with NB-73 exposure, FOXM1 protein was always found in<lb/> the nucleus and showed the same, greater than 90%, nuclear<lb/> localization as observed in control vehicle treated cells both by<lb/> immunofluorescence (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>) and by biochemical fractionation of<lb/> cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. <ref type="figure">4e</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Pharmacokinetics of compounds<lb/></head>

			<p>In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice, we found that some<lb/> compounds showed very good subcutaneous and oral bioavail-<lb/>ability (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Examination of compound half-lives and accumula-<lb/>tion in plasma after a single subcutaneous injection or oral<lb/> administration of the parent mono-and diamines (NB-55, 65, 70,<lb/> 72, and 51) revealed good and rather equivalent PK by either<lb/> route of administration. It is striking that the PK properties of the<lb/> monoamine NB-55, particularly after oral dosing, were markedly<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 5 Pharmacokinetics and half-lives of compounds in mice after s.c. or oral administration of amine compounds and their respective<lb/> methiodide salts. Pairs are NB-55 and NB-63; NB-65 and NB-68; NB-70 and NB-71; NB-72 and NB-73; and NB-51 and NB-115. PK was studied<lb/> after single dose administration via s.c. injection or oral gavage at the doses indicated. Multiple plasma samples were collected from each<lb/> mouse (n = 4) over the course of 48 h after compound was administered. Compounds were quantified using LC-MS/MS. The data were fitted<lb/> to a non-compartment PK model (error bars are ± SD).<lb/></figure>

			<p>superior to those of the diamines. Of note as well, conversion of<lb/> the mono-and diamines to their methiodide salts improved their<lb/> PK behavior after subcutaneous administration; the oral bioavail-<lb/>ability of these salts, however, was diminished (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Hence, after<lb/> s.c. injection of NB-63, NB-68, NB-71, NB-73, and NB-115, very<lb/> high blood levels of compound were observed, followed by long<lb/> half-lives (from~25-40 h, Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), whereas only very low levels<lb/> were found after oral administration. In contrast, the FOXM1<lb/> inhibitor FDI-6 achieved only very low blood levels after s.c.<lb/> administration at 20 mg/kg, and was undetectable after oral<lb/> administration at 40 mg/kg (and therefore not shown) (Supple-<lb/>mentary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Efficacy of compounds in suppressing the growth of human breast<lb/> tumor xenografts and FOXM1-regulated gene expression in<lb/> tumors<lb/> </head>

			<p>Studies in female NOD/SCID-gamma (NSG) mice showed that the<lb/> monoamine NB-55, when given orally daily, very effectively<lb/> suppressed the growth of human breast tumor xenografts (Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">6a</ref>). We also tested lower doses of the diammonium salts NB-68,<lb/> NB-71, and NB-73 as tumor suppressive agents, since these<lb/> compounds had higher inherent cellular potencies and achieved<lb/> higher blood levels after s.c. dosing than did NB-55. At 20 mg/kg<lb/> every other day for 10 days and then 10 mg/kg every other day<lb/> subsequently, NB-68, NB-71, and NB-73 were found to greatly<lb/> suppress tumor growth (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>). Because of their effectiveness, we<lb/> next treated animals with 5 and 10 mg/kg of NB-73 s.c. daily and<lb/> then every other day starting on day 21. As seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>, NB-73<lb/> reduced tumor growth at 5 mg/kg and more markedly suppressed<lb/> growth at 10 mg/kg. Accompanying this suppression of tumor<lb/> growth by NB-73, the expression of FOXM1-regulated genes,<lb/> including the FOXM1 gene itself, was reduced in tumors in a dose-<lb/>dependent manner, with all gene expressions being greatly<lb/> reduced upon treatment with 10 mg/kg NB-73 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>). Low<lb/> doses of NB-63 and NB-115, compounds that showed good PK<lb/> properties with high blood levels and long half-lives, were also<lb/> effective in suppressing the growth of tumor xenografts<lb/> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) and had little impact on animal body<lb/> weight.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>This study presents a new class of 1,1-diarylethylene mono-and<lb/> diamine compounds that function as effective suppressors of<lb/> FOXM1 activities. These compounds and their methiodide salts<lb/> bind directly to FOXM1 protein, labilize it towards proteolytic<lb/> degradation, and reverse patterns of FOXM1-regulated gene<lb/> expression. They also suppress breast cancer cell proliferation<lb/> and increase apoptosis, and they retard the growth of breast<lb/> xenograft tumors in an experimental preclinical mouse model<lb/> where we show that FOXM1-mediated gene expression is<lb/> suppressed in these growth-inhibited tumors.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 6 Compounds NB-55, NB-68, NB-71, and NB-73 suppress breast tumor xenograft growth and the expression of FOXM1-regulated genes.<lb/>Human breast cancer DT22 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of intact 7-week-old NSG mice and mice bearing DT22 tumors were<lb/> dosed in a daily and then every other day from day 7 on with 100 mg/kg of NB-55 or control vehicle by oral gavage; or b with NB-68, NB-71,<lb/> or NB-73 by s.c. injection at 40 mg/kg daily for 4 days and then 20 mg/kg every third day until day 13 and then 10 mg/kg every third day, or<lb/> with control vehicle. Tumor volumes in Veh and compound treated animals were monitored (2-way ANOVA, Dunnett&apos;s post-test, **P &lt; 0.01). In<lb/> c, animals were treated with low doses of NB-73 (5 or 10 mg/kg s.c. daily and then every other day after day 21). Volumes of tumors in Veh and<lb/> compound treated animals were monitored (2-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post-test, ****P &lt; 0.0001, n = 8 per group, error bars are ± SD). d At the<lb/> end of treatments, tumors from panel C were processed for gene expression analysis by q-PCR. (t-test, *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001; ****P<lb/> &lt; 0.0001, n = 8 per group, error bars are ± SD).<lb/></figure>

			<p>Several lines of evidence indicate that our compounds are<lb/> targeting FOXM1 and fulfill characteristics expected for validated<lb/> chemical probes for this target protein. <ref type="biblio">23,24</ref> By a cell-free FRET<lb/> binding assay, we show that the FOXM1 inhibitory compounds<lb/> bind directly to FOXM1 with affinities commensurate with their<lb/> cellular potencies. Treatment of cells with these compounds<lb/> reduced the intracellular level of FOXM1 and exposure of cell<lb/> extracts to these compounds increased FOXM1 degradation by<lb/> pronase, as observed in the drug affinity responsive target stability<lb/> (DARTS) protease sensitivity assay. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> This implies that compound<lb/> binding is perturbing the structure of FOXM1 to make it more<lb/> readily proteolyzed, which matches the fact that they also<lb/> decrease the intracellular level of FOXM1 protein. Of interest,<lb/> antiestrogen SERD compounds also inhibit and promote degrada-<lb/>tion of their target protein, ERα <ref type="biblio">26,27</ref> by conformational disordering<lb/> of the ligand-binding domain. Similar order-to-disorder conforma-<lb/>tional changes in FOXM1, recently shown to regulate its<lb/> transcriptional activity, are likely being affected by our compounds<lb/> in ways that also block FOXM1 activity and accelerate its<lb/> degradation. <ref type="biblio">28</ref> Also, gene regulation by NB-73 and NB-55, studied<lb/> in greatest detail, showed substantial overlap with that of FDI-6,<lb/> shown previously to target FOXM1, <ref type="biblio">16</ref> and with siFOXM1 treatment<lb/> of cells. Cell cycle analysis, showing an increase in the proportion<lb/> of cells in G2/M after treatment with NB-73, is also consistent with<lb/> FOXM1 activity being inhibited by NB-73. However, we do not yet<lb/> know if our compounds affect only FOXM1, although they show<lb/> selectivity in reducing intracellular FOXM1 without changing the<lb/> intracellular level of another important forkhead transcription<lb/> factor, FOXA1. In addition to regulating the expression of many<lb/> genes that promote tumorigenesis and cancer progression,<lb/> FOXM1 can also influence these processes through its interactions<lb/> with other key cellular proteins such as SMAD3 and β-catenin. <ref type="biblio">3<lb/></ref> Possible effects of our NB compounds on altering the activity of<lb/> FOXM1 through these protein interactions remain to be studied in<lb/> future investigations.<lb/></p>

			<p>Of the amine compounds studied that showed good potency<lb/> (IC 50 values less than 0.5 μM) and efficacy in cells in culture, several<lb/> had good in vivo PK properties. Although NB-55 and NB-65<lb/> showed good PK properties (half-lives and blood levels achieved)<lb/> after s.c. administration, only NB-55 showed good PK properties<lb/> after oral administration. Notably, the salts of all of the amine<lb/> compounds had greatly (5-50×) elevated blood levels and long<lb/> half-lives (t ½ = 24-39 h) by s.c. route. However, these salts showed<lb/> very low bioavailability (blood levels) by oral route. Because of<lb/> their high and prolonged blood levels, NB-63, NB-68, NB-71, NB-<lb/>73, and NB-115 were able to greatly suppress tumor growth<lb/> in vivo using low doses (2-20 mg/kg) administered s.c. daily or<lb/> every other day. By contrast, NB-55 required daily s.c. or oral<lb/> treatment at 100 mg/kg for effective tumor suppression, whereas<lb/> 20 or 40 mg/kg doses were found to be only marginally effective<lb/> (data not shown), consistent with its good but not outstanding<lb/> blood levels and its 5-fold reduced potency in suppression of cell<lb/> proliferation, as seen in dose-response studies in cells in culture.<lb/> Of note, we observed that FDI-6, for which no prior in vivo data<lb/> have been published, <ref type="biblio">16</ref> showed potency similar to NB-55 in cells<lb/> in culture but achieved only very low blood levels after s.c. or oral<lb/> administration.<lb/></p>

			<p>Of interest, the FOXM1 activity-regulating compounds<lb/> described in this manuscript were able to function as suppressors<lb/> of breast cancer cell proliferation and the expression of FOXM1-<lb/>signature genes and gene ontologies in a broad range of breast<lb/> cancer subtypes, both hormone receptor-positive (such as MCF7<lb/> and tamoxifen-resistant MCF7) and triple negative (such as DT22<lb/> and MDA-MB-231), as well as in BT474 (ER-positive, HER2-positive)<lb/> cells, where similar IC 50 concentrations for inhibition of cell<lb/> proliferation and FOXM1-regulated gene expressions were<lb/> observed. Indeed, there is considerable evidence for the<lb/> deleterious impact of high tumor FOXM1 on patient clinical<lb/> outcome in ER-positive breast cancers, <ref type="biblio">15,29,30</ref> in HER2-positive<lb/> breast cancers, <ref type="biblio">31</ref> and in triple negative breast cancers. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> FOXM1 is<lb/> also a key player in many other cancers, including glioblastoma,<lb/> ovarian, gastrointestinal, non-small cell lung cancers, and pan-<lb/>creatic ductal adenocarcinoma, <ref type="biblio">6,7,11,14,33,34</ref> for which there are<lb/> currently few optimal treatments. Hence, compounds that inhibit<lb/> FOXM1 activities might prove to be broadly useful in a variety of<lb/> cancer types.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this study, we found that these compounds were effective<lb/> antitumor agents when administered alone at low micromolar<lb/> doses in several breast cancer subtypes; nevertheless, it will be of<lb/> interest to test them in combination treatments targeting ER-<lb/>positive, recurrent metastatic endocrine therapy-resistant breast<lb/> cancers and aggressive triple negative breast cancers, when<lb/> administered with other current standard-of-care treatments. For<lb/> example, combinations of these FOXM1 inhibitors with Fulves-<lb/>trant, Letrozole, PI3K inhibitors, or CDK4/6 inhibitors <ref type="biblio">35,36</ref> might<lb/> enable improved tumor sensitivity and response, since we and<lb/> others have shown that knockdown of FOXM1 or inhibition of<lb/> FOXM1 activity with an ARF inhibitory peptide in cells in culture<lb/> could restore sensitivity to tamoxifen in tamoxifen-resistant breast<lb/> cancer cells. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Since FOXM1 has been found to reduce cancer<lb/> responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents and to radiation, <ref type="biblio">13,37<lb/></ref> inhibition of FOXM1 activity in triple negative breast cancers<lb/> might likewise reduce the amounts of chemotherapy drugs or<lb/> radiation needed, thereby improving cancer treatment and<lb/> perhaps reducing undesirable side effects of many current drug<lb/> therapies.<lb/></p>

			<p>The compounds we have developed suppress FOXM1 activities<lb/> and have favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Hence, these new<lb/> compounds offer intriguing translational opportunities for the<lb/> development of new anticancer agents, either as mono or<lb/> combination therapies targeting FOXM1 actions that drive<lb/> aggressive forms of breast cancer, as well as other cancers.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/></head> 

			<head>Cell lines and cell culture methods<lb/></head>

			<p>All breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and were<lb/> maintained and cultured as described. <ref type="biblio">15,38,39</ref> DT22 cells were derived from<lb/> a human triple negative invasive ductal breast carcinoma and were grown<lb/> in culture as described. <ref type="biblio">40</ref> All cells were tested for mycoplasma using Real-<lb/>Time PCR Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Akron Biotech, Boca Raton, FL).<lb/></p>

			<head>Chemical synthesis of compounds<lb/></head>

			<p>Full details on the preparation and spectroscopic characterization of all<lb/> compounds are given in the Supplementary Information.<lb/> </p>

			<head>Cell viability assay<lb/></head>

			<p>WST-1 assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) was used to quantify cell viability<lb/> as described. <ref type="biblio">38</ref> Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a VICTOR X5<lb/> PerkinElmer 2030 Multilabel Plate Reader. All assays were performed in<lb/> triplicate and analyzed using Graph Pad Prism 8.0.<lb/></p>

			<head>Western blot and Immunofluorescence assays<lb/></head>

			<p>For Western blot analysis, whole-cell extracts were prepared using 1X RIPA<lb/> lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 1X protease inhibitor<lb/> cocktail (Millipore Sigma). Proteins were separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE<lb/> gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. In some cases,<lb/> treatments with compound were done in the presence of the proteasome<lb/> inhibitor MG132 (Calbiochem) as described in the figure legend. Western<lb/> blotting used antibodies against FOXM1 (Abcam 184637, 1:1000; Cell<lb/> Signaling Technologies Catalog #5436, D12D5, 1:1000), ERα (Santa Cruz<lb/> Catalog #sc543, HC-20, 1:1000), FOXA1 (Abcam 23738, 1:1000), and β-actin<lb/> (Millipore-Sigma A2228, 1:10,000) as an internal loading control. Both<lb/> IRDye 800 CW goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (LI-COR, Cat# 926-<lb/>32211) and IRDye 680 CW goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (LI-COR,<lb/> Cat# 926-68070) were diluted (1:5000) for incubation with the blots. Band<lb/> </p>

			<p>intensities were analyzed with Licor Odyssey 2.1 software. All blots shown<lb/> together derive from the same experiment and were processed in parallel.<lb/> Full uncropped images of blots are shown as supplementary figures in the<lb/> Supplementary Information file. Molecular weight markers were Rainbow<lb/> markers from GE Healthcare <ref type="biblio">(38-225 kDa)</ref> or Precision Plus Dual Color<lb/> Markers from Biorad (37-250 kDa).<lb/></p>

			<p>Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy were performed<lb/> as described. <ref type="biblio">41</ref> Briefly, for immunofluorescence detection of FOXM1 in<lb/> cells, cells were grown in 8-well chamber slides (Ibidi, Verona, WI), fixed in<lb/> 4% formaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100. The cells<lb/> were then blocked, treated with primary antibody to phospho-FOXM1 (Cell<lb/> Signaling Technology Catalog #14655, D9M6G 1:100) followed by a<lb/> fluorescently-tagged secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch 711-<lb/>546-152, 1:500), and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI before imaging.<lb/> Three dimensional Z stacks were compressed, the compressed images<lb/> were exported to Image J, and the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF)<lb/> was calculated for each individual cell or nucleus. Data were statistically<lb/> analyzed as indicated in the figure legend.<lb/></p>

			<head>Fluorescence binding assays with FOXM1<lb/></head>

			<p>Competitive binding assays of compound binding to FOXM1 by tr-FRET<lb/> were done in FRET buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% NP-40<lb/> detergent, 10% glycerol) with 0.3 mg/ml ovalbumin and 0.1 mM butylated<lb/> hydroxy-anisole added fresh daily. Solutions of the protein, fluorescent<lb/> probe and compound dilutions were prepared at 3× concentrations, the<lb/> final dilution taking place as they were mixed together in equal portions<lb/> on the microtiter plate.<lb/></p>

			<p>A stock solution of biotin-FOXM1 was prepared and stored at 5.6 μM at<lb/> -80°C. For the assay, it was diluted to be 5 nM final concentration, with<lb/> 1.25 nM tetravalent streptavidin-terbium (SaTb). The compounds were<lb/> prepared at 7 × 10 -4 M in DMF (dimethylformamide) and then serially<lb/> diluted into FRET buffer plus 2% DMF to ensure solubility. Final<lb/> concentrations were 10 -5 M to 10 -9 M, with the last point being buffer<lb/> only, no compound. Fluorescein-NB-72 (Fl-NB-72) was prepared at 1 mM<lb/> in DMF and stored at -20°C. It was diluted into FRET buffer to give 100 nM<lb/> in the assay. Incubations were done in duplicate on black Molecular<lb/> Devices 96-well microtiter plates. 5 μl of Fl-NB-72 and 5 μl of the<lb/> compound dilutions, were mixed together on the plate. To this was added<lb/> 5 µl biotin-FoxM1 and incubated in the dark at room temperature, for 1 h.<lb/> Time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (tr-FRET) measurements<lb/> were with a Victor X5 plate reader (Perkin Elmer), with an excitation filter at<lb/> 340/10 nm and emission filters for terbium and fluorescein at 495/20 and<lb/> 520/25 nm, respectively, with a 100-μs delay in data acquisition. To correct<lb/> for background signals, biotin-FOXM1 was omitted, and diffusion-<lb/>enhanced FRET incubations were done in duplicate on black Molecular<lb/> Devices 96-well microtiter plates. Five microliter of Fl-NB-72 and 5 μl of the<lb/> compound solutions were mixed together and then 5 µl of FRET buffer<lb/> plus SaTb was added, mixed and incubated in the dark at room<lb/> temperature, for 1 h. The tr-FRET signals measured as above were<lb/> subtracted as a background from the first incubations that contained<lb/> biotin-FOXM1. Graphs were prepared using Graph Pad/Prism 4.<lb/></p>

			<p>The Ki was calculated by the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Ki (compound) =<lb/> IC50 (compound)/(1 + T0/Kd (Fl-NB-72)); T0 is the concentration of Fl-NB-<lb/>72 and Kd(Fl-NB-72) is its binding affinity for FOXM1, determined below.<lb/></p>

			<p>In direct binding experiments for determination of the Kd for Fl-NB-72,<lb/> the Fl-NB-72 ligand was diluted into FRET buffer + 2% DMF, to give<lb/> concentrations 3× of final. The biotin-FOXM1 was diluted to a concentra-<lb/>tion of 3 × (5 nM + 1.25 nM SaTb). 5 μl of each of these were mixed on a<lb/> black Molecular Devices microtiter plate with 5 μl of FRET buffer, so that<lb/> each component was diluted 3×. Each point was prepared in duplicate,<lb/> mixed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. tr-FRET was<lb/> measured on a Victor X5 microtiter plate reader with settings as<lb/> given above.<lb/></p>

			<head>Drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assay<lb/></head>

			<p>The DARTS assay was performed as described <ref type="biblio">25</ref> to examine the effect of<lb/> compounds on the stability of FOXM1 to proteolysis by exogenous<lb/> pronase. Cell lysates were incubated without or with compound for 1 h at<lb/> room temperature, and with varying concentrations of pronase (none;<lb/> 1:10 3 ; 1:3 × 10 3 ; 1:5 × 10 3 ; 1:10 4 ; and 1:10 5 dilution of a 12.5 mg/ml pronase<lb/> solution) for an additional 30 min at room temperature. Proteins were then<lb/> separated on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels and gels were exposed to FOXM1<lb/> antibody (Genetex GTX102170, 1:750) and β-actin antibody (1:500, mouse<lb/> monoclonal).<lb/></p>

			<head>Cell cycle analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>Cells were synchronized by double thymidine block prior to cell cycle<lb/> analysis by Propidium Iodide (PI) staining. Briefly, the cells were blocked<lb/> with 2 mM thymidine for 18 h, then released with fresh media for 8 h<lb/> followed by re-blocking with thymidine for another 16 h. Following the<lb/> second block, the cells were released with or without treatments with the<lb/> NB compounds and cells were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol at the<lb/> time points indicated. After alcohol fixation for 2 h, the cells were washed<lb/> with cold 1XPBS followed by staining with 50 µg/ml PI solution in PBS with<lb/> addition of 5 µg/ml RNAse A for at least 4 h. The cells were then analyzed<lb/> by the Flow Cytometry analyzer BD LSR II for percentage of cells in G1/G0,<lb/> S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.<lb/></p>

			<head>Apoptosis analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>The cells were analyzed for percentage of apoptotic cells following 24 h or<lb/> 72 h of vehicle or compound treatment by staining with the Alexa Fluor®<lb/> 488 Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit (Thermo Fisher) and flow cytometry<lb/> according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. Caspase activity in the cells after<lb/> treatment with control vehicle or compounds was determined using the<lb/> Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay system (Promega) in a 96-well format following the<lb/> manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Supplementary Figs <ref type="figure">6 and 7</ref> exemplify the<lb/> gating strategy used for the cell cycle and apoptosis flow cytometry<lb/> analyses.<lb/> </p>

			<head>Cytoplasmic and Nuclear extract preparation<lb/> </head>

			<p>Cells treated with vehicle or compounds were collected for preparation of<lb/> cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Briefly, cells were washed with ice cold<lb/> PBS and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min. Following removal of the<lb/> supernatant, the cell pellets were resuspended in 150-200 µL of cold CE<lb/> buffer (HEPES [10 mM] pH 7.9, KCI [10 mM], EDTA [0.1 mM], NP-40 0.3%<lb/> (added just before use) and 1X protease inhibitors (added just before use))<lb/> and incubated on ice for 5 min. Cells were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for<lb/> 5 min and the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was harvested. The pellets<lb/> were washed twice in 100 µl of CE buffer without NP-40. After removal of<lb/> supernatant, pellets were resuspended in 20-40 µl of NE buffer (HEPES<lb/> [20 mM] pH 7.9, NaCl [0.4 mM], EDTA [1 mM], glycerol 25%, 1X protease<lb/> inhibitors (added just before use)) and incubated on ice for 10 min,<lb/> followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min and harvest of<lb/> supernatant (nuclear extract). All centrifugations were done at 4 C.<lb/></p>

			<head>RNA isolation and real-time PCR<lb/></head>

			<p>Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed<lb/> using MMTV reverse transcriptase (New England BioLabs). Real-time PCR<lb/> was performed using SYBRgreen PCR Master Mix (Quantabio) as<lb/> described. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Relative mRNA levels of genes were normalized to the<lb/> housekeeping gene 36B4, and fold-change calculated relative to the<lb/> vehicle treated samples. Results are the average ± SD from at least two<lb/> independent experiments carried out in triplicate. Primer sequences for<lb/> the genes studied were obtained from the Harvard Primer Bank.<lb/> Sequences are available on their website.<lb/></p>

			<head>RNA-Seq transcriptional profiling and gene ontology analysis<lb/></head>

			<p>For gene expression analysis, total RNA was extracted from cells using<lb/> Trizol reagent and further cleaned using the Turbo DNase and RNAqueous<lb/> kits (ThermoFisher). Cells were treated with Veh (0.1% EtOH), or with the<lb/> compounds indicated for 9 h or 24 h. Once the sample quality and<lb/> replicate reproducibility were verified, samples from each group were<lb/> subjected to sequencing. RNA at a concentration of 100 ng/µl in nuclease-<lb/>free water was used for library construction. cDNA libraries were prepared<lb/> with the mRNA-TruSeq Kit (Illumina, Inc.). In brief, the poly-A containing<lb/> mRNA was purified from total RNA, the RNA was fragmented, double-<lb/>stranded cDNA was generated from fragmented RNA, and adapters were<lb/> ligated to the ends.<lb/></p>

			<p>The paired-end read data from the HiSeq 4000 were processed and<lb/> analyzed through a series of steps. Base calling and de-multiplexing of<lb/> samples within each lane were done with Casava 1.8.2. The RNA sequences<lb/> were prepared with Illumina&apos;s TruSeq Stranded mRNAseq Sample Prep kit.<lb/> Reads were trimmed of adapters and low expression data using<lb/> Trimmomatic version 0.38. <ref type="biblio">42</ref> The STAR alignment tool version 2.5.3a was<lb/> used to align the sequenced reads to the GRCh37 human genome from<lb/> Ensembl. <ref type="biblio">43</ref> Gene counts were calculated using subread version 1.5.2. <ref type="biblio">44,45<lb/></ref> The edgeR Bioconductor package in R was used for normalization and<lb/> differential expression analysis. Default normalization methods were used,<lb/> specifically trimmed mean of M values or TMM was used to calculate the<lb/> normalized expression values. This method calculates the weighted<lb/> trimmed mean of the log expression ratios in a gene-wise fashion. <ref type="biblio">46,47<lb/></ref> We considered genes with fold-change &gt; 2 and p-value &lt; 0.05 as<lb/> statistically significant, differentially expressed.<lb/></p>

			<p>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) <ref type="biblio">48</ref> was used for examination of our<lb/> genome-wide expression profiles. Overrepresented gene ontology (GO)<lb/> biological processes were determined by the web-based DAVID Bioinfor-<lb/>matics Resources database. <ref type="biblio">49,50</ref> REVIGO (Reduce and Visualize Gene<lb/> Ontologies) was utilized to visualize overrepresented GO biological<lb/> processes. <ref type="biblio">51<lb/></ref></p>

			<head>Pharmacokinetic studies<lb/> </head>

			<p>All experiments involving animals were conducted in accordance with<lb/> National Institutes of Health (NIH) standards for the care and use of animals,<lb/> with protocols approved by the University of Illinois IACUC. The pharmaco-<lb/>kinetics of compounds were monitored after single dose administration into<lb/> female CD1 mice (7-9 weeks of age) via s.c. injection or oral gavage, as<lb/> described. <ref type="biblio">39</ref> For s.c. injection, each compound was dissolved in DMSO and<lb/> then mixed with corn oil for a total injection volume of 100 μL (10% DSMO +<lb/> 90% corn oil) per mouse. For oral gavage, compounds were administered in a<lb/> 200 µL formulation of 9/0.5/0.5/90 parts of PEG400/Tween80/Povidone/0.5%<lb/> Carboxymethylcellulose in DI water. Multiple plasma samples were collected<lb/> from each mouse (n = 4 for each experiment) over the course of 48 h after<lb/> compound administration. Compounds were quantified by LC-MS/MS at the<lb/> University of Illinois Metabolomics Core Facility. The data were fitted to a<lb/> non-compartment model.<lb/></p>

			<head>In vivo breast cancer xenograft studies<lb/></head>

			<p>For examination of the effects of compounds on breast tumor growth<lb/> suppression, intact female NOD/SCID-gamma (NSG) mice were used as<lb/> detailed previously. <ref type="biblio">39</ref> DT-22 breast cancer cells (1 × 10 6 cells/mouse) were<lb/> injected s.c. into the right axial mammary gland. Mice received s.c.<lb/> injection or oral gavage daily or every second or third day as indicated,<lb/> with vehicle or treatment compound, and tumor volume (length × width 2 /<lb/> 2) was monitored over time.</p>
