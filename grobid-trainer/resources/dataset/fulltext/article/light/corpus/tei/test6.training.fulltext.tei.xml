			<p>Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a breast cancer subtype,<lb/> are highly aggressive tumors occurring frequently in young<lb/> women and in African American women who have a very poor<lb/> prognosis. TNBCs are defined as breast cancers lacking the<lb/> expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and<lb/> epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In our previous studies,<lb/> we identified several kinases overexpressed in TNBCs as compared<lb/> with ER-positive breast cancers and showed that inhibition of the<lb/> expression of several of these kinases suppressed the growth of<lb/> TNBC cells. <ref type="biblio">1</ref> One such critical kinase is the maternal embryonic<lb/> leucine zipper kinase (MELK). <ref type="biblio">1</ref> Several reports have identified that<lb/> MELK expression is highly elevated in many human cancers and<lb/> high MELK expression is associated with poor prognosis. <ref type="biblio">2-7<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>MELK is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the AMPK family<lb/> of kinases known to regulate cellular metabolism. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> MELK was<lb/> initially discovered as one of the three mRNAs uniquely expressed<lb/> during early embryonic development. <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> MELK is also one of the<lb/> proliferation markers included in Food and Drug Administration-<lb/>approved breast cancer prognostic panels, such as Mamma-<lb/>Print <ref type="biblio">11,12</ref> and PAM50, <ref type="biblio">13</ref> which are used to plan treatment for breast<lb/> cancer patients and to predict cancer recurrence. High expression<lb/> of MELK is required for maintenance of mammary tumor-initiating<lb/> cells <ref type="biblio">14</ref> and glioma stem cells. <ref type="biblio">15,16</ref> In addition, MELK has been<lb/>  reported to control several biological processes including cell<lb/> proliferation and cell cycle, invasion, apoptosis, splicing, and<lb/> resistance to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. <ref type="biblio">17-28</ref> In contrast,<lb/> MELK expression is not required for normal development, as<lb/> knockout mice have no developmental defects. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> However, two<lb/> recent studies showed that knockout of MELK, using CRISPR-cas9<lb/> system, did not reduce the growth of TNBC cells. <ref type="biblio">29,30</ref> Further<lb/> studies by Wang et al. <ref type="biblio">31,32</ref> addressed the discrepancy of MELK role<lb/> on cancer cell growth, which revealed that MELK expression is<lb/> required for clonogenic growth of TNBC cells when cells were<lb/> cultured at low density, whereas MELK is not required for<lb/> clonogenic growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells that have<lb/> low MELK expression. In this study, we sought to determine the<lb/> molecular mechanism by which MELK is upregulated in TNBC<lb/> breast cancers. We discovered that MELK expression is associated<lb/> with p53 mutation status. The tumor suppressor protein, p53, is a<lb/> transcription factor that controls both activation and repression of<lb/> gene expression in eukaryotic cells. <ref type="biblio">33,34</ref> Wild-type p53 (WT p53)<lb/> regulates the expression of many genes by inducing or repressing<lb/> transcription, whereas loss or mutation of p53 promotes tumor-<lb/>igenesis. <ref type="biblio">33-35</ref> Inactivation of WT p53 is a common event during<lb/> cancer development and nearly half of all human cancers, and over<lb/> 80% of TNBC patients, harbor mutations in the p53 gene, resulting<lb/> in loss of WT p53 activity. <ref type="biblio">36<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>Through these studies, we elucidated the molecular mechanism<lb/> by which MELK is highly expressed in TNBCs. We discovered that<lb/> high expression of MELK in p53-mutant breast cancers is due to<lb/> the loss of WT p53 activity, which normally functions in p53<lb/> WT cells by repressing E2F1A binding to the FOXM1 promoter,<lb/> which reduces FOXM1 expression and, in turn, MELK expression.<lb/> We also discovered that in p53-mutant TNBCs, E2F1A is recruited<lb/> to FOXM1 promoter, causing increased expression of FOXM1,<lb/> which binds to the MELK promoter and activates MELK transcrip-<lb/>tion, thus increasing MELK expression in TNBCs. These studies<lb/> demonstrate that in p53-mutant breast cancers, E2F1A and<lb/> FOXM1 regulates the expression of MELK, a novel kinase<lb/> associated with poor prognosis and a potential novel target for<lb/> the treatment of these aggressive cancers.<lb/></p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head>

			<head>MELK expression is highly elevated in p53-mutant breast cancers<lb/> </head>

			<p>We previously identified protein kinases upregulated in human<lb/> ER-negative tumors as compared with ER-positive breast cancers.<lb/> One of these kinases, MELK, is highly expressed in TNBC tumors<lb/> compared with normal breast and non-TNBC breast cancers<lb/> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1A, B</ref>), and the elevation of MELK expression<lb/> occurs in early-stage breast cancers (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1C, D</ref>). To<lb/> investigate the mechanism by which MELK expression is highly<lb/> elevated in TNBCs, we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<lb/> and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Con-<lb/>sortium (METABRIC) breast cancer patient data sets (cBioPortal) to<lb/> determine whether upregulated MELK expression correlates with<lb/> gene copy number, promoter methylation, or any specific<lb/> oncogenic mutations. Our analysis revealed that elevated MELK<lb/> expression is significantly enriched in breast tumors with p53<lb/> mutations in both TCGA Provisional and METABRIC <ref type="biblio">37</ref> data sets<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>). Consistent with our finding, upregulation of MELK<lb/> expression in p53-mutant breast tumors compared with their<lb/> matched normal breast tissues is significantly higher than WT p53<lb/> counterparts (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). Nearly 80% of TNBC tumors<lb/> harbor mutations in the p53 gene, a tumor suppressor gene, which<lb/> is inactivated in over 50% of all human cancers. Furthermore,<lb/> analysis of two independent breast cancer patient data sets (Curtis<lb/> and Ivshina) <ref type="biblio">38,39</ref> showed that MELK expression is elevated at mRNA<lb/> levels in p53-mutant breast cancer tumors (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>) and the<lb/> elevation of MELK expression is independent of ER status<lb/> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). Consistent with this observation, MELK<lb/> expression is significantly elevated in p53-mutant cancers of the<lb/> lung, bladder, brain, and prostate compared with their WT p53<lb/> tumors (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). Similar to MELK mRNA expression,<lb/> MELK protein is elevated in p53-mutant breast cancer cell lines<lb/> compared with WT p53 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c, d</ref>). Minn et al. <ref type="biblio">40</ref> showed that<lb/> MELK is one of the 54 genes associated with metastasis of primary<lb/> breast cancer cells to the lungs. To determine whether MELK<lb/> expression status correlates with metastasis-free survival rate, we<lb/> analyzed three independent breast cancer data sets (Schmidt,<lb/> Desmedt, and Esserman), <ref type="biblio">41-43</ref> which demonstrated that high MELK<lb/> expression is significantly associated with poor metastasis-free<lb/> survival in all three data sets (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Dominant-negative p53 mutants increase MELK expression by<lb/> inhibiting WT p53<lb/> </head>

			<p>Previous reports have shown that gain-of-function p53 mutants<lb/> induce the expression of several critical genes involved cancer<lb/> initiation and progression. <ref type="biblio">35,44</ref> We next tested whether p53<lb/> mutants regulate MELK expression by depleting the expression<lb/> of mutant p53 in TNBC cells that have high MELK expression.<lb/> Depletion of mutant p53 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) did<lb/> not reduce the expression of MELK (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). To determine whether<lb/> mutant p53 induces the expression of MELK, we generated stable<lb/>  cells to express p53 mutants (R175H, R249S, R273H, and R280K) in<lb/> p53-null cells (MDA MB 436 and SKOV3) and measured MELK<lb/> expression. In both SKOV3 and MDA MB 436 cells, overexpression<lb/> of p53 mutants did not induce MELK expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).<lb/> However, overexpression of these p53 mutants in WT p53 cells<lb/> (MCF7 and ZR-75 cells) induced MELK expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>). These<lb/> mutants appear to act as dominant-negative proteins, which<lb/> inhibit the WT activity of p53. These data suggest that inhibition of<lb/> WT p53 is the key mechanism to elevate MELK expression.<lb/></p>

			<head>Inactivation of WT p53 increases MELK expression<lb/> </head>

			<p>We next tested whether elevated expression of MELK is due to the<lb/> loss of WT activity of p53. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited WT<lb/> p53 by using siRNA in WT p53-containing cells. As shown in Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">2d</ref>, we depleted WT p53 in two normal breast epithelial cell lines<lb/> and two ER-positive breast cancer cell lines that have WT p53.<lb/> Knockdown of WT p53 significantly increased MELK protein<lb/> expression. Similarly, knockdown of p53 increased MELK mRNA<lb/> expression in WT p53 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>) but not in mutant p53 cells<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">2f</ref>). These results suggest that loss of WT activity of p53 is the<lb/> key mechanism for elevated MELK expression in TNBC cells. Based<lb/> on this data, we hypothesized that WT p53 acts as a transcriptional<lb/> repressor of MELK. To test this hypothesis, we generated stable<lb/> MDA MB 436 and SKOV3 cells with inducible expression of WT p53<lb/> using a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible system (pInducer20-p53 WT).<lb/> SKOV3 and MDA MB 436 are p53-null cell lines and express high<lb/> levels of MELK. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3a-d</ref>, induction of WT p53 by Dox<lb/> treatment significantly reduced MELK protein levels in both cell<lb/> lines, while increasing p21 protein levels (a downstream marker of<lb/> WT p53). In addition, Dox treatment did not reduce MELK protein<lb/> levels in MDA MB 436 cells expressing empty vector, suggesting<lb/> that Dox reduces MELK expression by inducing WT p53<lb/> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). Furthermore, inhibition of the<lb/> proteasome-dependent protein degradation pathway did not<lb/> affect the repressive effects of WT p53 on MELK protein levels<lb/> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>). In addition, induction of WT p53 by<lb/> doxorubicin in MCF7 and Cal51 (WT p53 cells) repressed MELK<lb/> protein levels in a dose-dependent manner Fig. <ref type="figure">3e</ref>. In addition to<lb/> transcriptional activation, WT p53 represses gene transcription. We<lb/> analyzed breast cancer data sets (Curtis and TCGA) to determine<lb/> whether MELK expression correlates with WT p53-induced or<lb/> repressed genes. <ref type="biblio">45</ref> Analysis of breast cancer data sets revealed<lb/> that MELK expression is significantly correlated with p53-<lb/>repressed genes (Fig. <ref type="figure">3f</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3C</ref>) but not with<lb/> p53-induced genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3D</ref>). Collectively, these<lb/> results suggest that WT p53 acts as a negative regulator of MELK<lb/> expression, and that loss of WT p53 activity elevates MELK<lb/> expression in TNBC cells.<lb/></p>

			<head>WT p53 represses MELK promoter activity<lb/> </head>

			<p>To test whether WT p53 controls MELK expression by regulating<lb/> the activity of the MELK promoter, we cloned a -5 kb promoter<lb/> region of MELK (isolated from human mammary epithelial cells,<lb/> HMECs) upstream to the transcription start site. Analysis of MELK<lb/> promoter (using the TransFac software tool) revealed that the<lb/> -5 kb region of MELK promoter region contains four potential p53<lb/> response elements (RE1 through RE4), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>. First, we<lb/> measured the activity of MELK promoter in p53-deficient cells to<lb/> test whether p53 status controls MELK promoter activity. For this,<lb/> we transfected the -5 kb MELK promoter into MCF7 cells that<lb/> stably expressed p53 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knockdown WT<lb/> p53 or a control shRNA (shScramble). As shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>,<lb/> depletion of WT p53 in MCF7 cells significantly increased MELK<lb/> promoter activity, suggesting that loss of WT p53 elevates MELK<lb/> expression. Consistent with this observation, induction of WT p53,<lb/> using a Dox-inducible system to induce WT p53, suppressed MELK<lb/> promoter activity in both MDA MB 436 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>) and SKOV3<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4d</ref>) cells. These results show that WT p53 represses MELK<lb/> expression by controlling MELK promoter activity, whereas loss of<lb/> WT p53 elevates MELK expression. Similarly, inhibition of WT p53<lb/> by overexpression of dominant-negative p53 mutants in MCF7<lb/> cells (WT p53 cells) also significantly increased MELK promoter<lb/> activity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4A, B</ref>), suggesting that dominant-<lb/>negative forms of p53 mutants induce MELK expression by<lb/> inhibiting the repressive effects of WT p53.<lb/></p>

			<head>Deletion of putative p53 response elements does not affect<lb/> repressive effect of WT p53 on MELK promoter activity<lb/> </head>

			<p>To determine whether any of the four p53 response elements<lb/> (RE1, RE2, RE3, and RE4) is critical for WT p53-mediated inhibition<lb/> of MELK promoter (as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4e</ref>), we sequentially deleted<lb/> these elements and transfected these MELK promoter constructs<lb/> into p53-null cells (MDA MB 436 and SKOV3) that had been stably<lb/> transfected with a Dox-inducible WT p53 construct. We then<lb/> measured promoter luciferase activity in the presence and<lb/> absence of WT p53 (achieved by culturing with or without Dox).<lb/> Induction of WT p53 repressed the -5 kb MELK promoter activity,<lb/> as well as the activity of all truncated MELK promoter constructs to<lb/> levels comparable to the -5 kb MELK promoter in both MDA MB<lb/> 436 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4f</ref>) and SKOV3 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4C</ref>) cells. We also<lb/> measured the activity of these constructs in MCF7 cells with both<lb/> intact WT p53 and deficient p53. As shown in Supplementary Fig.<lb/> <ref type="figure">4D</ref>, the activity of all of these constructs was very low in intact WT<lb/> p53 cells (shControl), whereas depletion of WT p53 by<lb/> shP53 significantly elevated the luciferase activity of all constructs.<lb/> Similarly, inhibition of WT p53 by overexpressing the dominant-<lb/>negative p53 mutant (R175H) enhanced the activity of MELK<lb/> promoters in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4E</ref>). To further<lb/> investigate whether WT p53 is recruited to any of these putative<lb/> response elements on MELK promoter, we performed chromatin<lb/> immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments to determine whether<lb/> WT p53 is recruited to the MELK promoter. As shown in<lb/> Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4F</ref>, WT p53 is not recruited to any of the<lb/> response elements on the MELK promoter. However, WT p53 is<lb/> recruited to the p21 promoter (used as a positive control). We<lb/> analyzed several p53-ChIP-seq data sets to identify WT p53-<lb/>binding sites on MELK promoter. In one of these data sets, WT p53<lb/> is reported to be recruited to MELK at the exon1/intron1 region. <ref type="biblio">46</ref><lb/> </p>

			<p>Contrary to this observation, we found that WT p53 is not<lb/> recruited to this site (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). Overall, our results<lb/> suggest that WT p53 represses MELK promoter activity but does<lb/> not bind to any of the putative p53 response elements.<lb/></p>

			<p>Next, to identify the region of MELK promoter that is required<lb/> for WT p53-dependent suppression of MELK expression, we made<lb/> additional deletions in the MELK promoter and determined<lb/> whether any of these deletions block the repressive effect of WT<lb/> p53 on MELK promoter activity. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4g, h</ref> and<lb/> Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>, and using the same Dox-inducible system<lb/> to induce WT p53 in p53-null cells (MDA 436 cells and SKOV3),<lb/> deletion of the region between - 1.69 kb and - 0.69 kb sig-<lb/>nificantly reduced p53-dependent suppression of MELK promoter<lb/> activity.<lb/></p>

			<head>WT p53 represses MELK expression by repressing FOXM1<lb/> expression<lb/> </head>

			<p>As WT p53 represses MELK promoter activity without binding to its<lb/> response elements, we hypothesized that WT p53 controls MELK<lb/> expression by regulating some other transcription factor. We then<lb/> screened the MELK promoter using TransFac software to identify<lb/> potential transcription factors that can bind to MELK promoter<lb/> between - 1.69 and - 0.69 kb. Previously, Wang et al. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> reported<lb/> that FOXM1, an upregulated transcription factor in many human<lb/> cancers, regulates MELK expression by directly binding to the<lb/> MELK promoter. Through our TransFac analysis, we identified a<lb/> novel site for FOXM1 at -686 bp, which is different from the site<lb/> identified by Wang et al. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> (-512 bp). However, consistent with<lb/> results reported by Wang et al. <ref type="biblio">23</ref> , knockdown of FOXM1 reduced<lb/> MELK expression in p53-mutant TNBC cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>). Knockdown of<lb/> WT p53 increased FOXM1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>), whereas induction<lb/> of WT p53 suppressed FOXM1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>), suggesting that<lb/> WT p53 represses MELK expression by reducing FOXM1 levels.<lb/> Supporting this data, MELK expression levels correlate with<lb/> FOXM1 RNA expression levels, as well as with the FOXM1-<lb/>regulated gene, Aurora kinase B (AURKB), in TCGA breast cancer<lb/> dataset (Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Previously, Millour et al. <ref type="biblio">47</ref> showed that WT p53 represses<lb/> FOXM1 levels by reducing E2F1A levels at the FOXM1 promoter.<lb/> To test whether E2F1 plays a critical role in p53-dependent<lb/> repression of FOXM1 and MELK, we inhibited E2F1 expression in<lb/> p53 WT and p53-mutant breast cancer cells. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5e</ref>,<lb/> knockdown of E2F1A reduced the expression of FOXM1 and MELK<lb/> in p53-mutant TNBC cells, whereas knockdown of E2F1A in p53<lb/> WT breast cancer cells (MCF7) did not affect FOXM1 and MELK<lb/> protein levels. We then investigated whether WT p53 represses<lb/> E2F1A levels to repress FOXM1 and MELK expression. As shown in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>, overexpression of WT p53 did not alter the expression<lb/></p>

			<p>levels of E2F1A in p53-null cells (MDA MB 436). However, ChIP<lb/> analysis revealed that E2F1A is recruited to FOXM1 promoter<lb/> selectively in p53-mutant cells (MDA MB 436 and MDA MB 468)<lb/> but not in p53 WT cells (MCF7 and Cal51) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5g</ref>), suggesting that<lb/> through an as of yet unknown mechanism, WT p53 regulates the<lb/> E2F1 activity to repress FOXM1 and MELK expression.<lb/></p>

			<head>WT p53 blocks the recruitment of FOXM1 to MELK promoter<lb/> </head>

			<p>To test whether overexpression of FOXM1 can overcome the<lb/> repressive effects of WT p53 on MELK expression, we over-<lb/>expressed FOXM1 in WT p53 and p53 mutant cells. As shown in<lb/> Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>, b, overexpression of FOXM1 increased MELK expression in<lb/> p53 mutant (MDA MB 468 and HCC1937) cells, but failed to induce<lb/> MELK expression in WT p53 cells (MCF7 and MCF12A) (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>),<lb/> suggesting that WT p53 prevents FOXM1&apos;s ability to induce MELK<lb/> expression. To further test whether p53 blocks FOXM1-induced<lb/> MELK expression, we ectopically expressed FOXM1 in the<lb/> presence and absence of WT p53 (using a Dox-inducible system<lb/> to induce WT p53) in p53-null cells (MDA MB 436 and SKOV3). As<lb/> shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref> (in both cell lines), overexpression of FOXM1<lb/> increased MELK expression in the absence of WT p53 but did not<lb/> induce MELK expression in the presence of WT p53. These data<lb/></p>

			<p>suggest that WT p53 represses MELK expression through multiple<lb/> mechanisms. First, WT p53 causes reduced FOXM1 expression,<lb/> which in turn leads to reduced MELK expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>). Second,<lb/> even in the presence of FOXM1, WT p53 interferes with FOXM1&apos;s<lb/> ability to induce MELK expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>). WT p53 causes reduced<lb/> FOXM1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>) and also inhibits the ability of FOXM1<lb/> to induce MELK expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>). Furthermore, as shown in the<lb/> Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5C, D</ref>, overexpression of WT p53 suppresses<lb/> FOXM1-induced MELK expression and promoter activity. However,<lb/> it is not clear how WT p53 interferes with FOXM1 ability to induce<lb/>  MELK expression. Previous studies have shown that WT p53 can<lb/> repress gene expression by blocking the recruitment of transcrip-<lb/>tion factors. <ref type="biblio">48,49</ref> Therefore, we hypothesized that WT p53 blocks<lb/> the recruitment of FOXM1 to the MELK promoter by directly<lb/> binding to FOXM1. As shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure">6d</ref>, co-immunoprecitation<lb/> assay demonstrated that FOXM1 physically interacts with WT p53<lb/> in MDA MB 436 cells (last lane in western blotting). To test<lb/> whether WT p53 blocks the recruitment of FOXM1 to MELK<lb/> promoter, we performed FOXM1 ChIP experiments. For this study,<lb/> we ectopically expressed FOXM1 in the absence and presence of<lb/> WT p53 (induced by Dox) in MDA MB 436 cells. The ChIP study<lb/> results showed that FOXM1 is recruited to the MELK promoter at<lb/> </p>

			<p>both the - 686 bp and - 512 bp sites in the absence of WT p53.<lb/> However, ectopic expression of WT p53 blocked FOXM1 recruit-<lb/>ment to both of these sites in the MELK promoter (Fig. <ref type="figure">6e</ref>). Ectopic<lb/> expression of WT p53 also blocked FOXM1 recruitment to the<lb/> AURKB promoter (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5E</ref>), which functions as a<lb/> positive control for the FOXM1 ChIP assay. These results<lb/> demonstrate that WT p53 blocks the recruitment of FOXM1 to<lb/> the MELK promoter, and that when p53 is lost or mutated, FOXM1<lb/> is able to bind to the MELK promoter, thus increasing MELK<lb/> expression.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying high<lb/> MELK expression in TNBCs. We discovered that elevated MELK<lb/> expression is associated with p53 mutation status, and that high<lb/> MELK expression is caused by loss of WT p53. Our results<lb/> demonstrate that WT p53 represses MELK expression by inhibiting<lb/> the expression and promoter-binding ability of FOXM1, a<lb/> transcription factor that induces MELK transcription. We also<lb/> showed that mutant p53 induces de-repression of the MELK<lb/> promoter, thus increasing MELK expression. These results explain<lb/></p>

			<p>the molecular basis for high MELK expression in p53-mutant<lb/> breast cancers, including TNBCs.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our results are summarized in the model shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>, which<lb/> shows that in cells containing WT p53, WT p53 actively represses<lb/> MELK expression by inhibiting FOXM1 transcription and reducing<lb/> FOXM1 binding to the MELK promoter. However, in cells with<lb/> mutant p53: (1) E2F1A induces FOXM1 expression and (2) FOXM1<lb/> binds to the FOXM1 sites in the MELK promoter, thereby<lb/> increasing MELK expression.<lb/></p>

			<p>Previously, we identified MELK, a serine/threonine protein<lb/> kinase, as a highly expressed kinase in TNBC patients. Several<lb/> studies reported that high expression of MELK is required for<lb/> cancer cell growth, invasiveness, cell cycle progression, stemness,<lb/> radiation-, and chemo-resistance in cancer. <ref type="biblio">14,17-24,50-55</ref> Similar to<lb/> gene knockdown studies, MELK inhibitors also reported to be very<lb/> effective in both in vitro and in vivo studies despite the fact that<lb/> these inhibitors have significant off-target effects. <ref type="biblio">7,56-64</ref> Recently,<lb/> Touré et al. <ref type="biblio">65</ref> discovered a novel MELK inhibitor using a virtual<lb/> screening high throughput approach. This compound has highest<lb/> selectivity for MELK among the MELK inhibitors published to date<lb/> and inhibited the growth of TNBC cells expressing high MELK but<lb/> not ER-positive cells that express MELK at low levels. <ref type="biblio">65</ref> However,<lb/> recent studies utilizing gene knockout strategies reported contra-<lb/>dicting results that MELK expression is not required for the growth<lb/> of cancer cells including breast cancer cells, despite the fact that<lb/> MELK is highly expressed in these cells. <ref type="biblio">29,66</ref> Similarly, another<lb/> study by Huang et al. <ref type="biblio">30</ref> reported that the anti-growth effects of<lb/> small-molecule MELK inhibitors are due to nonspecific targets and<lb/> increasing the specificity of these inhibitors to MELK reduced their<lb/> anti-growth effects. However, studies by Wang et al. <ref type="biblio">31,32</ref> revealed<lb/> that knockout of MELK inhibits growth in breast cancer cells under<lb/> low density culture conditions, whereas knockout of MELK did not<lb/> affect the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells in which MELK<lb/> expression is low.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our studies demonstrate that high expression of MELK in TNBC<lb/> cells is due to the loss of WT p53 or mutation in the p53 gene,<lb/> which is a common phenomenon in 50% of human cancers. p53-<lb/>mutant cancers have poor outcomes and tend to metastasize<lb/> frequently, which prompted us to elucidate the role p53 on<lb/> regulation MELK expression in TNBC. The elevation of MELK<lb/> expression is also observed in multiple human cancers where p53<lb/> is commonly mutated, suggesting that high expression of MELK in<lb/> p53-mutant tumors is not specific to breast cancer and is a<lb/> common<lb/> phenomenon<lb/> in<lb/> multiple<lb/> human<lb/> cancer<lb/> types. <ref type="biblio">3,14,15,18,24,55,67,68</ref> Thus, our results in TNBCs may also be<lb/> relevant for other cancer types.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our results demonstrated that FOXM1 is an important regulator<lb/> of MELK expression in TNBC cells. FOXM1 is a critical transcription<lb/> factor, upregulated in many human cancers, including breast<lb/> cancer. <ref type="biblio">69,70</ref> Similar to MELK expression, FOXM1 is highly expressed<lb/> in p53-mutant cancers due to the loss of WT p53 function. Wang<lb/> et al. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> demonstrated that FOXM1 knockdown reduced MELK, and<lb/>  that FOXM1 binds to the -512 bp site in the MELK promoter. Our<lb/> studies confirmed the binding of FOXM1 to this site, but also<lb/> uncovered a novel FOXM1-binding site at -612bp in the MELK<lb/> promoter. It is not clear whether these two sites function<lb/> independently or together, stabilizing a multi-protein complex<lb/> to regulate MELK transcription. A previous study demonstrated<lb/> that knockout of FOXM1 significantly retards tumor growth and<lb/> colonization of p53-null lymphoma and sarcoma cells in the<lb/> lungs. <ref type="biblio">71</ref> FOXM1 also has been shown to control the expression of<lb/> genes to promote cell proliferation, invasiveness, metabolism, and<lb/> drug resistance. <ref type="biblio">72-75<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>Another study by Barsotti et al. <ref type="biblio">74</ref> showed that FOXM1<lb/> expression was also suppressed by WT p53 in breast cancer cells.<lb/> WT p53 represses FOXM1 expression by inhibiting the recruitment<lb/> of E2F1A <ref type="biblio">47</ref> and our studies revealed that knockdown of E2F1A<lb/> reduces MELK expression by reducing FOXM1 levels in p53-<lb/>mutant breast cancer cells. E2F1A is a transcription factor that is<lb/> commonly deregulated in multiple human cancers including<lb/> breast cancer. High expression of E2F1A is associated with poor<lb/> prognosis and controls cell cycle, apoptosis, autophagy, differ-<lb/>entiation, and stress response in many cancer types. <ref type="biblio">76-79</ref> Thus, the<lb/> results by us and by others demonstrate that the transcriptions<lb/> factors that control MELK expression, E2F1A, FOXM1, and p53, also<lb/> regulate key biologic functions of cancer cells.<lb/></p>

			<p>In summary, we identified that MELK is highly expressed in p53-<lb/>mutant breast cancers as compared with p53 WT cancers and<lb/> elucidated the mechanism by which mutant p53 causes<lb/> upregulation of MELK in these p53-mutant breast cancer cells.<lb/> Through this study, we discovered that MELK expression is highly<lb/> upregulated in TNBCs due to the loss of WT p53 activity. We also<lb/> observed high MELK expression in many other human cancers,<lb/> where p53 is commonly mutated. Our results show that WT p53<lb/> represses MELK expression by inhibiting expression and recruit-<lb/>ment of FOXM1 to the MELK promoter. Through these studies, we<lb/> identified a novel molecular mechanism by which mutant p53 de-<lb/>represses MELK expression in p53-mutant TNBC breast cancers,<lb/> and identified FOXM1 and MELK as possible targets for the<lb/> treatment of p53-mutant breast cancers.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/></head> 

			<head>Cell lines and reagents<lb/></head>

			<p>In this study, we used a panel of cell lines as listed in Supplementary Table<lb/> <ref type="table">1</ref>. All of these cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were grown in the<lb/> growth medium (listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="figure">1</ref>). V5-tagged P53 mutant<lb/> constructs (pLenti-6.0) pInducer20 were obtained from Addgene (listed in<lb/> Supplementary Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). pCMV3 FOXM1 flag-tag was purchased from Sino<lb/> Biologicals (Cat# HG12392-CF).

			<head>Cloning of MELK promoter<lb/></head>

			<p>For cloning of MELK promoter, we isolated genomic DNA using a DNA<lb/> extraction kit, (Qiagen, Cat# 69501) from primary HMECs and PCR amplified<lb/> various lengths of MELK promoter regions using the primer sets listed in<lb/> Supplementary Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Gel-purified PCR products were then cloned into a<lb/> linearized PGL2-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) using the Quick<lb/> fusion cloning kit (Biotool, Cat# B2261), according to the manufacturer&apos;s<lb/> instructions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cloning of WT p53 into pInducer20<lb/></head>

			<p>Using Gateway method, we cloned WT p53 (pCR8 p53 WT) into pInducer20<lb/> (Addgene) following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Briefly, 50-150 ng of<lb/> donor vector (pCR8 p53 WT) and 150 ng of pInducer20 plasmids were<lb/> mixed with LR Clonase II (Cat# 11791, Invitrogen) and incubated at 25°C<lb/> for 1 h and reaction was terminated by adding Proteinase K. The reaction<lb/> products were then used to transform DH5a bacteria and positive clones<lb/> were selected on ampicillin containing agar plates <ref type="biblio">80-84</ref>.<lb/> </p>

			<head>Luciferase assay<lb/> </head>

			<p>For promoter luciferase assays, we co-transfected 200,000 cells of MDA MB<lb/> 436 or 100,000 cells of MCF7 and SKOV3 with 300 ng of PGL2 MELK<lb/> promoter with 50 ng of PhRG Renilla vector (internal control) using<lb/> XTremeGene9 transfection reagent (Cat# XTG9-RO) purchased from Roche.<lb/> After 48 h, the cells were lysed in 150 μl of passive lysis buffer and 20 μl of<lb/> clear lysate was used for luciferase activity using a dual-luciferase assay kit<lb/> (Promega, Cat# E#1910), following the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.<lb/></p>

			<head>Transfection and western blotting<lb/></head>

			<p>To knock down p53, E2F1A, and FOXM1, siRNA transfections were<lb/> performed using DharmaFect1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon, Cat# T-<lb/>2001-03), according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. To overexpress<lb/> FOXM1 protein, we transfected breast cells (2 × 10 5 cells) with FOXM1<lb/> plasmid or empty vector in a six-well plate using XtremeGene9 transfection<lb/> reagent (Cat# XTG9-RO) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.<lb/> Protein samples were prepared by lysing the cells in RIPA buffer (Sigma-<lb/>Aldrich, Cat# R0278) supplemented with protease inhibitors and phos-<lb/>phatase inhibitors on ice for 30 min. Lysed cell lysates were collected and<lb/> centrifuged at 14.000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4°C. Equal amount of proteins<lb/> were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western<lb/> blotting analysis for proteins of interest using antibodies at optimized<lb/> concentrations. The full list of antibodies used in this study is given in<lb/> Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>. All western blottings from the same experiment<lb/> were run in parallel and the full blots are available in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head>Generation of stable cells<lb/></head>

			<p>Stable cells were generated to overexpress p53 (WT and p53 mutants)<lb/> using lentivirus particles containing p53 constructs. To produce lentivirus,<lb/> we transfected Lenti-HEK-293 cells with 2 μg of p53 construct, 1.5 μg of<lb/> viral protein R (VPR), and 0.5 μg of vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus G<lb/> protein (VSVG), a common coat protein for lentiviral vector expression<lb/> systems using X-treme-Gene9 transfection reagent (Roche, Cat# XTG9-RO)<lb/> for 72 h. Viral particles were collected from the medium by collecting<lb/> supernatant after centrifuging the medium at 4000 r.p.m. for 30 min. One<lb/> milliliter of lentivirus medium and 10 μg of polybrene were added to infect<lb/> the cells of interest. After 48 h, G418 (to select WT p53) or blasticidin (to<lb/> select p53 mutants) were added to select and generate stable cells. Stable<lb/> cells were tested for expression of WT p53 and p53 mutants through<lb/> western blotting analysis of HA-tag for p53 WT or V5-tag for p53 mutants.<lb/></p>

			<head>ChIP and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis<lb/> </head>

			<p>ChIP experiments were performed as described previously with minor<lb/> modifications. Briefly, for each ChIP, cells were isolated from two 150 cm 2<lb/> plates. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and<lb/> incubated cells with 1% formalin in PBS for 10 min to crosslink proteins<lb/> and DNA. Crosslinking was stopped with an incubation with 0.125 M<lb/> glycine for 5 min. The cells were collected in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM<lb/> EDTA in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.1) and sonicated to fragment genomic DNA into<lb/> 200-500 bp pieces. For each ChIP, 600 μg protein lysate was used to<lb/> immunoprecipitate p53, E2F1A, or FOXM1. The pulled down DNA<lb/> fragments were extracted using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen,<lb/> cat# 28104) and subjected to quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) using the iTaq SYBR<lb/>  green assay (BioRad, Cat# 1725121). The primer sets used for these assays<lb/> are listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. The Q-PCR result was normalized to<lb/> input fragments and the recruitment of p53, E2F1A, or FOXM1 were<lb/> presented as a fold change of PCR amplification in p53 or FOXM1 ChIP<lb/> samples compared with that of IgG samples.<lb/></p>

			<head>Analysis of MELK expression and patient survival in breast cancer<lb/> data sets<lb/></head>

			<p>To determine the association of MELK expression with p53 mutation status,<lb/> we obtained MELK mRNA expression data from the Oncomine database.<lb/> mRNA expression data from Curtis et al., <ref type="biblio">38</ref> Ivshina et al. <ref type="biblio">39</ref> (breast cancer data<lb/> sets), Ding et al. <ref type="biblio">81</ref> (lung cancer), Grasso et al. <ref type="biblio">82</ref> (prostate cancer), Lindgren<lb/> et al. <ref type="biblio">83</ref> (bladder cancer), and Neale et al. <ref type="biblio">84</ref> (brain cancer) were used to<lb/> compare MELK mRNA levels between p53 WT and p53-mutant cancer patient<lb/> samples. For breast cancer data sets, we also separated patient samples based<lb/> on ER status and determined the association between MELK mRNA expression<lb/> and p53 mutation status. The Student&apos;s t-test was used to determine the<lb/> statistical significance of MELK expression between p53 WT and p53 mutant<lb/> samples. Three independent data sets (Desmedt, Hatzis, and Schimdt) from<lb/> the Oncomine database were analyzed to generate metastasis-free survival<lb/> curves. Samples were dichotomized based on the mean expression level of<lb/> MELK and log-rank (Mantel-Cox) method and Cox proportional hazards<lb/> model were used to determine statistical significance. To determine the<lb/> correlation between MELK expression and p53 regulated genes, we obtained<lb/> gene expression data from TCGA and Curtis data sets. Correlation curves and<lb/> Pearson&apos;s p-values and r 2 -values were generated using GraphPad Prism.</p>
