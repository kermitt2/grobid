			<head>Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Urodynamic studies such as cystometrograms (CMGs) are used to study bladder function,<lb/> diagnose bladder disease, and even develop treatments for bladder dysfunctions. Ideally, the<lb/> subject should be awake and unanaesthetized during these studies <ref type="biblio">1</ref> . However anesthesia,<lb/> which can confound urodynamic outcomes <ref type="biblio">2-4</ref> , is often required in many animal models of<lb/> urodynamic studies, particularly when treatments for bladder dysfunctions are being tested in<lb/> experimental paradigms that require control over the animal&apos;s state.<lb/></p>

			<p>Cats are a common animal model for spinal cord injury and associated bladder pathology.<lb/> Despite their relatively small body size, their spinal cord is of similar length and anatomy to the<lb/> human spinal cord <ref type="biblio">5-7</ref> . Urodynamic studies in awake cats are challenging. Placement of<lb/> indwelling bladder catheters for awake studies is invasive, and can lead to complications such<lb/> as cystitis. Temporary catheter placement for urodynamic trials necessitates the administration<lb/> of anesthetic agents <ref type="biblio">8</ref> that interfere with autonomic reflexes to varying degrees <ref type="biblio">9,10</ref> . Agents<lb/> minimally inhibitory towards autonomic reflexes such as α-chloralose or urethane, are not<lb/> recommended for survival procedures due to concerns of prolonged recovery or carcinogenicity<lb/> <ref type="biblio">11<lb/></ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>While current literature has shown differences in CMG parameters such bladder capacity,<lb/> peak pressure, and non-voiding contractions (NVCs) based on different anesthetic agents,<lb/> studies are limited especially in cats. To our knowledge, no studies have characterized the<lb/> following agents used in clinical veterinary medicine for cats on CMG parameters: 1) alfaxalone,<lb/> 2) dexmedetomidine, and 3) propofol (without the use of another anesthetic).<lb/></p>

			<p>Dexmedetomidine is commonly used as a sedative-anesthetic in veterinary medicine (and to<lb/> facilitate CMG testing in our laboratory <ref type="biblio">12</ref> ), due to its ease of administration (intramuscular [IM],<lb/> and rapid recovery through the reversal agent atipamezole). However, in a rat study,<lb/> dexmedetomidine was inhibitory to the volume evoked micturition reflex and peak pressure<lb/> compared to urethane and awake trials <ref type="biblio">13</ref> . Propofol, an anesthetic agent used to facilitate CMG<lb/> testing in clinical veterinary medicine <ref type="biblio">14,15</ref> , has not been compared directly to dexmedetomidine<lb/> in cat trials, but is suspected to be less inhibitory than dexmedetomidine due to its mechanism<lb/> of action (propofol has no analgesic properties, while dexmedetomidine does) and ability to<lb/> carefully titrate anesthetic depth through intravenous [IV] infusion. Unfortunately, propofol can<lb/> only be given IV, so it often requires another agent to secure IV access. Alfaxalone, recently<lb/> approved in the United States for use in cats, has a similar mechanism of action and clinical<lb/> application as propofol, but has not been used in cats in the context of urodynamic studies.<lb/> Unlike propofol, alfaxalone is formulated for IM dosing and does not require an additional agent<lb/> <ref type="biblio">16<lb/></ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>In this study we anesthetized male cats with alfaxalone, dexmedetomidine, and propofol at<lb/> the lowest anesthetic doses practical to facilitate CMG testing prior to terminal procedures that<lb/> used isoflurane and α-chloralose. We assessed the effect of anesthetic agent on CMG and<lb/> anesthetic parameters, hypothesizing that some anesthetic agents would be more inhibitory<lb/> towards bladder function than others. Vascular access ports (VAPs) were placed prior to trials,<lb/> to ensure propofol could be studied independently without the need for another agent.<lb/></p>

			<head>Results<lb/></head>

			<p>Five cats were anesthetized at least 3 times with each agent (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). At<lb/> least 2 CMG trials were conducted per session. We only collected terminal (isoflurane and α-<lb/>chloralose) trials from four of five cats due to one unexpected death.<lb/></p>

			<head>Cystometrogram Parameters<lb/></head>

			<p>Bladder capacity differed significantly between agents (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>,<lb/> Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). Bladder capacity was greatest with α-chloralose (59.6 ± 9.2 ml), and<lb/> significantly increased compared to alfaxalone (46.7 ± 8.6 ml, p = 0.02), dexmedetomidine (42.9<lb/> ± 8.6 ml, p &lt; 0.001), and propofol (44.2 ± 8.6 ml, p = 0.003). Bladder capacity under isoflurane<lb/> (54.5 ± 9.1 ml) was significantly increased compared to dexmedetomidine (p = 0.03).<lb/> Additionally, Δpressure also differed significantly between agents (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>, Supplementary Table<lb/> <ref type="table">S2</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>. Trials under propofol had the greatest Δpressure (116.5 ± 9.6 cm<lb/> H20), and were significantly increased compared to isoflurane (84.2 ± 13.1 cm H20, p = 0.04)<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). Compliance did not differ significantly between agents (p &gt; 0.05 for all pairwise<lb/> comparisons, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Non-voiding contraction rate was highest with α-chloralose (0.033 ± 0.004 NVCs/s) and<lb/> significantly higher than all other agents (p &lt; 0.01 for all comparisons; Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>, Supplementary<lb/> Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>, SupplementaryTable <ref type="table">S3</ref>). Alfaxalone (0.012 ± 0.003 NVCs/s) had the second highest<lb/> rate of NVCs, and was significantly greater than dexmedetomidine which had the lowest rate of<lb/> NVCs (0.002 ± 0.003 NVCs/s, p = 0.008). The amplitude of non-voiding contractions was not<lb/> different between agents (p &gt; 0.05).<lb/></p>

			<p>The trends of the CMG bladder pressure responses changed with agent, with different<lb/> agents having variable periods of passive filling compared to active contraction over the trial.<lb/> Notably, propofol CMG responses were characterized by an early and gradual rise (longer<lb/> period of active contraction), compared to dexmedetomidine responses which were<lb/> characterized by a long period of low pressure (passive contraction) and a rapid rise<lb/> immediately before voiding (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). The bladder pressure trends for<lb/> other agents fell between the propofol and dexmedetomidine extremes. This was further<lb/> described through quantification of slopes at select time points (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). During slope 1 (start to<lb/> 100 seconds before void), propofol (0.06 ± 0.01 cm H20/s) was significantly increased compared<lb/> to alfaxalone (0.03 ± 0.01 cm H20/s, p &lt; 0.0001) and dexmedetomidine (0.02 ± 0.01 cm H20/s,<lb/> p &lt; 0.001). During slope 2 (100s before void to 50s before void), α-chloralose had the highest<lb/> slope (0.51 ± 0.08 cm H20/s), significantly higher than dexmedetomidine (0.17 ± 0.05 cm H20/s,<lb/> p = 0.001) and alfaxalone (0.27 ± 0.05 cm H20/s, p = 0.03). During slope 3 (50s before void to<lb/> void event) dexmedetomidine (1.45 ± 0.11 cm H20/s) was significantly greater than all other<lb/> agents: alfaxalone (1.10 ± 0.11 cm H20/s p = 0.009), α -chloralose (0.63 ± 0.18 cm H20/s, p &lt;<lb/> 0.001), isoflurane (0.57 ± 0.17 cm H20/s, p &lt; 0.001), and propofol (0.65 ± 0.11 cm H20/s, p &lt;<lb/> 0.001).<lb/></p>

			<head>Anesthetic Parameters<lb/></head>

			<p>Mean HR and mean ΔHR both varied between agents (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>, Supplementary<lb/> Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). Mean HR, compared across all five agents, was highest<lb/> under alfaxalone (215.16 ± 5.69 bmp), and significantly greater than all other agents: α-<lb/>chloralose (163.29 ± 9.49 bmp, p &lt; 0.001), dexmedetomidine (110.66 ± 5.75, p &lt; 0.001),<lb/> isoflurane (130.73 ± 8.18 bmp, p &lt; 0.001), and propofol (176.72 ± 5.81 bmp, p &lt; 0.001). All<lb/> other agents fell in between the two extremes. Mean change in heart rate (ΔHR), compared<lb/> across only non-terminal agents, was lowest with dexmedetomidine (13.79 ± 6.80 bmp), and<lb/> significantly different from propofol (37.50 ± 7.05 bmp, p = 0.0082) and alfaxalone (45.36 ± 6.65<lb/> bmp, p &lt; 0.001). Mean ΔHR did not differ significantly between propofol and alfaxalone (p =<lb/> 0.76). Two trials (both propofol) were excluded from the averaged continuous HR plot (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>)<lb/> due to suspect artifacts.<lb/> Time to lateral recumbency and time to head up and walking differed significantly between<lb/> the non-terminal agents (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>, Supplemental Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>). The time to lateral<lb/> recumbency was shortest under propofol due to IV administration (2.42 ± 1.62 minutes), and<lb/> significantly shorter than alfaxalone (9.49 ± 1.49 minutes, p = 0.009). The time to head up and<lb/> walking were shortest under dexmedetomidine (1.73 ± 6.07, 2.53 ± 10.58 minutes) due to use of<lb/> the reversal agent atipamezole compared to alfaxalone (37.24 ± 6.10 [p &lt; 0.001], 55.26 ± 10.64<lb/> [p &lt; 0.001] minutes) and propofol (43.22 ± 6.28 [p &lt; 0.001], 73.70 ± 10.64 [p &lt; 0.001] minutes)<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>). In general, reflexes showed greater anesthetic depth under dexmedetomidine<lb/> compared to alfaxalone and propofol, although jaw tone was tighter under dexmedetomidine<lb/> (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>Adverse Consequences<lb/></head>

			<p>Adverse consequences associated with VAP placement included surgical dehiscence (1/5),<lb/> and port failure (1/5). In the cat with port failure, the last propofol trial was performed through<lb/> isoflurane induction, in order to facilitate IV catheter placement. Dexmedetomidine caused<lb/> vomiting immediately after injection in 7/15 (46.7%) of sessions. Cats did not vomit under other<lb/> agents. Each cat vomited at least once under dexmedetomidine. One cat had an independent<lb/> incidence of lethargy and vomiting unassociated with an anesthetic event, and was diagnosed<lb/> with disseminated lymphoma at necropsy. One cat displayed significant bradycardia with 2 nd<lb/> degree atrioventricular (AV) block arrhythmia under dexmedetomidine in 2 separate<lb/> anesthetized events. Echocardiogram and subsequent necropsy of this cat suggested evidence<lb/> of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and myofibril degeneration and atrophy. Finally, 1/13<lb/> (7.7%) alfaxalone trials resulted in unexpected death. During recovery, after the CRI had been<lb/> discontinued, one cat became apneic and was not able to be resuscitated.<lb/></p>

			<head>Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>In this study we demonstrated differences in urodynamic parameters and anesthetic depth<lb/> at minimal doses needed to perform CMG testing in male cats. To our knowledge, this was the<lb/> first study to examine CMG parameters under alfaxalone, propofol in isolation without another<lb/> agent, or dexmedetomidine in comparison to the other agents used here. Our study<lb/> incorporates a novel method of CMG assessment (bladder pressure slopes) in conjunction with<lb/> traditional CMG parameters and careful evaluation of anesthetic depth. Together, our results<lb/> provide recommendations for anesthetic choice based on study parameters of interest and<lb/> logistic feasibility for CMG studies in male cats. Due to cross-species commonalities in<lb/> response to anesthetic agents, select information from this study may be able to be guide<lb/> preliminary anesthetic choice to other species, including humans. However, feasibility and effect<lb/> on urodynamic and anesthetic parameters should be confirmed for the species in question.<lb/></p>

			<p>Bladder capacity increases due to inhibition of central nervous system reflexes under<lb/> anesthesia (post-operative urinary retention) <ref type="biblio">9</ref> . In this study, the bladder increases seen under<lb/> terminal agents (isoflurane and α-chloralose) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) were strongly correlated with prolonged<lb/> anesthesia (isoflurane [2-6 hours before CMG trials, 8-10 hours total], followed by α-chloralose<lb/> [12-22 hours before CMG trials]) and repeated bladder fills for other experimental objectives.<lb/> Although we did not see significant differences between survival agents, dexmedetomidine has<lb/> been reported to cause polyuria through blockage of arginine-vasopressin release <ref type="biblio">22,23</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Maximum detrusor pressure [Pdet(max)] can also be used to assess bladder function <ref type="biblio">15</ref> . We<lb/> reported Δpressure to account for any positioning differences between trials that may have<lb/> affected baseline pressures. Consistent with previous studies examining Pdet(max) <ref type="biblio">3,14</ref> , we<lb/> found that Δpressure was higher with propofol, and lower with isoflurane (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>). While this<lb/> may be attributed to the lighter plane of anesthesia under propofol (general anesthetics<lb/> depresses Pdet(max) in a dose-dependent manner <ref type="biblio">3,14</ref> ), a human study showed that even under<lb/> comparable anesthetic depth, propofol showed less suppression of cortical somatosensory<lb/> evoked potentials compared to isoflurane <ref type="biblio">24</ref> . Alternatively, the increase in Δpressure may be<lb/> related to loss of function and initiation of the voiding reflex under propofol, as evidenced by<lb/> bladder slopes drastically different from the awake state. While the results of propofol are<lb/> difficult to interpret, isoflurane should be avoided in studies where Pdet(max) or Δpressure is a<lb/> key parameter of interest.<lb/></p>

			<p>Non-voiding contractions are phasic pressure increases seen during bladder filling <ref type="biblio">25</ref> that<lb/> may be linked to sensations relating to bladder volume <ref type="biblio">26</ref> . They are more likely and more<lb/> frequently occur with urinary bladder pathologies <ref type="biblio">25,27,28</ref> . Consistent with our understanding that<lb/> α-chloralose maintains spinal reflexes relative to other anesthetic agents <ref type="biblio">2</ref> , the greatest number<lb/> of NVCs were observed with α-chloralose (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>). Alfaxalone trials had the next greatest<lb/> number of NVCs, and the most out of the non-terminal agents studied. Notably,<lb/> dexmedetomidine almost completely eliminated NVCs compared to other agents. The α2<lb/> mediated analgesic properties of dexmedetomidine may block the sensation of bladder filling at<lb/> the spinal or supra-spinal level <ref type="biblio">16,29</ref> . Clinically, dexmedetomidine has been used for analgesia<lb/> and prevention of post-operative catheter-related bladder discomfort <ref type="biblio">30</ref> . However, awake CMG<lb/> trials have significantly less NVCs than anesthetized trials <ref type="biblio">12</ref> , so absence of NVCs is not<lb/> necessarily pathological. When NVCs are desired (ex: overactive bladder models), α-chloralose<lb/> (non-survival) and alfaxalone (survival) can be considered, and dexmedetomidine should be<lb/> avoided.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this study CMG bladder pressure slopes differed between agents (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), interpreted as<lb/> previously described variable periods of passive filling and active contraction <ref type="biblio">31</ref> . Pressure slopes<lb/> under dexmedetomidine (characterized by a flat filling period, followed by a sharp rise to the<lb/> void event) are most similar to awake animal cystometrograms <ref type="biblio">32,33</ref> . In contrast, pressure slopes<lb/> under propofol had the most obvious change from the awake slope, characterized by an early<lb/> rapid rise and less obvious void event. Although there are no standardized criteria for defining<lb/> passive filling and active contraction, we found propofol consistently reached a higher<lb/> normalized pressure compared to dexmedetomidine across normalized time, with the most<lb/> obvious separation noted between 900 -950 normalized time, where the mean normalized<lb/> pressure ± standard deviation range of dexmedetomidine is distinctly separate from the<lb/> corresponding range for propofol (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). A previous rat study using a single anesthetic agent<lb/> (tiletamine-zolazepam) at varying doses found lighter anesthesia was associated with more<lb/> awake-like bladder curves <ref type="biblio">32</ref> . However, our study found dexmedetomidine (deeper plane of<lb/> anesthesia) was associated with more awake-like bladder responses compared to GABA-ergic<lb/> agonists with a lighter plane of anesthesia. This discrepancy suggests that suppression of<lb/> bladder reflexes may not be directly correlated with others of anesthetic depth (anesthetic<lb/> reflexes measured in this study, heart rate, ΔHR). The exact significance of bladder pressure<lb/> slopes is unclear, but we recommend further investigation of bladder pressure response trends<lb/> in future studies in association to anesthetic depth, pharmacokinetics, and preservation of spinal<lb/> reflexes, as well as potential bladder pathology.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition to affecting CMG and urodynamic parameters, each agent offers unique logistical<lb/> benefits and constraints. Dexmedetomidine (α2 agonist), conveniently administered through IM<lb/> boluses (CRI only recommended for analgesia, not for sedation or anesthesia <ref type="biblio">16</ref> ) and rapidly<lb/> reversed through atipamazole, provides a convenient method of anesthetizing cats. Due to the<lb/> nature of IM bolus administration, depth of anesthesia and therefore bladder function can vary<lb/> as plasma levels of dexmedetomidine increase or decreases. Common adverse effects of<lb/> dexmedetomidine include bradycardia, arrhythmias (AV block), and vomiting <ref type="biblio">16</ref> , all of which<lb/> were noticed in our experiments.<lb/></p>

			<p>Propofol and alfaxalone (GABAA agonistics) are used clinically to both induce (IV) and<lb/> maintain (CRI or repeat IV bolus) anesthesia <ref type="biblio">11</ref> . Maintenance of anesthesia using a CRI allows<lb/> for steady-state drug plasma levels and a more stable plane of anesthesia. While propofol is<lb/> limited to IV administration, alfaxalone can be given IM for single-agent anesthesia. Common<lb/> side effects of both propofol and alfaxalone are apnea, although one study showed alfaxalone<lb/> had less respiratory depression compared to propofol <ref type="biblio">34</ref> . Unexpectedly, we experienced a death<lb/> during the recovery phase (most common time of anesthetic-related death <ref type="biblio">35</ref> ) of one alfaxalone<lb/> trial. To our knowledge, this was an isolated incident and not representative of the general<lb/> safety of alfaxalone.<lb/></p>

			<p>In this study, we were able to decease concentrations of GABA-ergic agonists below<lb/> recommended labelled dosing in part due to the stable plane of anesthesia associated with CRI<lb/> administration. This could be one explanation for the lighter plane of anesthesia (more<lb/> preserved reflexes, higher average heart rate, and greater change in heart rate over trial)<lb/> observed in GABA-ergic agonistics compared to dexmedetomidine (Figs. <ref type="figure">3 and 4</ref>). However,<lb/> another concurrent explanation for increased heart rate under the GABA-ergic agonists is<lb/> hypotension with reflex tachycardia <ref type="biblio">36</ref> . This is in contrast with dexmedetomidine, which causes<lb/> vasoconstriction, leading to hypertension and reflex bradycardia <ref type="biblio">16</ref> . Consistent with previous<lb/> studies in dogs showing alfaxalone causes less cardiovascular depression than propofol <ref type="biblio">36</ref> , we<lb/> observed the mean heart rate under alfaxalone (at or slightly above the upper limit of awake<lb/> reference range <ref type="biblio">37</ref> ) was significantly higher than under propofol (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<p>Isoflurane (exact mechanism of action unknown <ref type="biblio">16,38</ref> , but suspected to affect GABA<lb/> receptors <ref type="biblio">39</ref> ) is the primary inhalant anesthetic used in veterinary medicine, especially in<lb/> prolonged invasive procedures <ref type="biblio">16</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Although in this study it was only used during terminal procedures, in clinical veterinary<lb/> medicine isoflurane is commonly used during recovery procedures. Its inhaled route of<lb/> administration allows dosing to be easily titratable to adjust the depth of anesthesia. However,<lb/> inhaled agents are logistically more challenging, either requiring technical expertise to intubate<lb/> the animal, or risking personnel exposure. Since recovery from isoflurane is rapid, and<lb/> isoflurane has been previously used to facilitate propofol administration for urodynamic<lb/> procedures <ref type="biblio">40</ref> , the effects of isoflurane on subsequent α-chloralose and propofol trials in this<lb/> study are assumed to be minimal.<lb/></p>

			<p>The non-survival hypnotic α-chloralose (mechanism unknown) provides light long-lasting<lb/> anesthesia with minimal analgesia, and minimal effect on normal spinal and sympathetic reflex<lb/> function <ref type="biblio">2,11</ref> . Unfortunately, α-chloralose is not recommended for survival studies due to<lb/> involuntary excitement and prolonged recovery <ref type="biblio">11</ref> although several studies have successfully<lb/> recovered animals following α-chloralose anesthesia <ref type="biblio">41,42</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Limitations of this study include the following: 1) lack of direct comparison to awake CMG<lb/> trials, 2) inability for full randomization due to logistical constraints (drug availability, ability to<lb/> secure IV access, etc), although effort was made to spread out agents, so that each agent was<lb/> tested once within the first 3 trials, once within the next 3 trials, and once within the final 3 trials,<lb/> 3) inability to extrapolate data to female cats, 4) limited data for terminal agents (isoflurane and<lb/> α-chloralose) due to nature of the experiments and the unexpected death of one animal, 5) lack<lb/> of blinding in data analysis and experiments, especially for qualitative measures such as<lb/> anesthetic reflexes, 6) lack of monitoring data other than heart rate due to measurement artifact<lb/> and animal movement during trials, and 7) inability to control for different doses and routes of<lb/> administration of a single drug due to logistical considerations and sample size. Future<lb/> directions to address these limitations include additional routes and doses of single agents,<lb/> concurrent CMG in awake cats for direct comparison to anesthetized cats, and filling of ex-vivo<lb/> or post-mortem bladders to provide a truly passive bladder control.<lb/></p>

			<head>Methods<lb/></head> 

			<head>Animals<lb/></head>

			<p>Five adult, intact male domestic shorthair cats (7-18 months, 4-6 kg, Marshall BioResources,<lb/> Inc., North Rose, NY) were included in this study. These animals were available from other<lb/> study, and the cohort size is similar to other relevant studies <ref type="biblio">3,14,17</ref> . Animals were group housed<lb/> in a temperature (72 ± 2 °F) and humidity (30 -70%) controlled room on a 12:12 hour light/dark<lb/> cycle with ad libitum access to water and fed a complete diet for adult cats (Purina One Urinary<lb/> Tract Health Formula and Purina ProPlan EN, Nestle Purina, Neenah, WI). Cats were free of<lb/> feline herpesvirus, calicivirus, panleukopenia, coronavirus, feline immunodeficiency virus,<lb/> chlamydia, and toxoplasmosis. All experimental procedures were performed at an AAALAC<lb/> accredited institution, according to the standards established by the Guide for the Care and Use<lb/> of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal<lb/> Care and Use Committee.<lb/></p>

			<head>Vascular Access Port<lb/></head>

			<p>Each cat was implanted with a VAP (ClearPort Mid VAPs 5Fr with a rounded tip, 24&quot;<lb/> catheter; Access Technologies, Skokie, IL) to guarantee immediate IV access. IV access was<lb/> essential for avoiding a second agent in propofol experiments, and useful in providing a<lb/> constant rate infusion (CRI) in the alfaxalone and propofol experiments to maintain anesthesia.<lb/> Cats were induced with dexmedetomidine (0.02 mg/kg, Dexmedseed, Dechra, Overland Park,<lb/> KS), ketamine (6.6 mg/kg, Zetamine, Vet One, Boise, ID), and butorphanol (0.66 mg/kg,<lb/> Torbugesic, Zoetis, Kalamazoo, MI), and maintained on isoflurane (0-2.5 %, Fluriso, Vet One,<lb/> Boise, ID). Incisions were made on the left ventral neck and dorsal neck or back. A catheter was<lb/> inserted and secured in the left jugular vein, and tunneled to a subcutaneous port secured to the<lb/> muscle between the shoulder blades <ref type="biblio">18,19</ref> . The port was accessed with a non-coring Huber<lb/> needle (Access Technologies, Skokie, IL), and flushed regularly (weekly, or after each use) with<lb/> a locking solution (TCS Lock Solution, Access Technologies, Skokie, IL) or heparinized saline.<lb/> Post-operative medications (buprenorphine [0.01-0.02 mg/kg, Par Pharmaceutical, Chestnut<lb/> Ridge, NY], robenacoxib [6 mg/kg, Onsior, Elanco, Greenfield, IN] and famotidine [0.5 mg/kg,<lb/> West-ward, Eatontown, NJ]) were given for 24 hours post-operatively. The cats were monitored<lb/> daily until suture removal 7-14 days later.<lb/></p>

			<head>Anesthesia<lb/></head>

			<p>Each cat was anesthetized at least three times (&quot;sessions&quot;) with each of three agents: (1)<lb/> dexmedetomidine (0.02 -0.04 mg/kg IM bolus; reversed with matched volume of atipamezole<lb/> [Antisedan, Orion Corporation, Espoo, Finland] after session), (2) alfaxalone (5 mg/kg IM bolus<lb/> + 0.08 mg/kg/min IV CRI, Alfaxan Multidose, Jurox Inc. Kansas City, MO), and (3) propofol (2<lb/> mg/kg IV bolus + 0.15 -0.20 mg/kg/min IV CRI, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL). Effort was made<lb/> to randomize sessions (each agent was tested once within the first 3 trials, once within the next<lb/> 3 trials, and once within the final 3 trials), but full randomization could not be achieved due to<lb/> logistical constraints (agent availability, repeat trials, etc.). Each session was on a different day,<lb/> at least 2 days after the previous anesthetized session.<lb/></p>

			<p>During terminal procedures in conjunction with other studies, cats were anesthetized with<lb/> the same dexmedetomidine/ketamine/butorphanol combination as for the VAP surgery, and<lb/> transitioned to isoflurane, then α-chloralose (70 mg/kg induction, 20 mg/kg maintenance every<lb/> 4-6 hours or as needed [MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA]), supplemented with 0.01 mg/kg<lb/> buprenorphine <ref type="biblio">20</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<head>Cystometrograms<lb/></head>

			<p>At least two CMG trials were conducted in each session. Warmed saline (41 °C) was<lb/> pumped at 2 mL/min (AS50 infusion pump, Baxter, Deerfield, IL; or PHD 2000, Harvard<lb/> Apparatus, Holliston, MA) through a fluid warmer (Hotline Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical,<lb/> Minneapolis, MN) and one lumen of a dual-lumen urethra catheter (Umbili-Cath™ 3.5 Fr<lb/> Polyurethane UVC Catheter, Utah Medical, Midvale, UT) into the urinary bladder. For non-<lb/>terminal sessions, sterile preparation of the perineal region and catheter was performed to<lb/> mitigate against infection. The other lumen of the catheter was connected to a pressure<lb/> transducer (V6402 pressure transducer, Smiths Medical, Minneapolis, MN) and Labchart<lb/> (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) for recording. At bladder capacity a void event occurred<lb/> and urine would leak around the catheter into a collecting tray (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). The bladder was emptied<lb/> and a break of at least 10 minutes was given between trials to allow the bladder to relax.<lb/> Bladder capacity was calculated as the maximum of the total volume infused or the sum of urine<lb/> collected from bladder and collecting tray. The variables analyzed for each CMG were bladder<lb/> capacity, change in pressure from baseline to maximum (Δpressure), compliance<lb/> (capacity/Δpressure), number and amplitude of non-voiding contractions (NVCs), and slopes of<lb/> the bladder pressure (&quot;pressure slopes&quot;) over three intervals as defined below.<lb/></p>

			<p>The time to lateral recumbency after initial agent injection and times to head up and walking<lb/> (ten consecutive steps without falling) were recorded for each anesthetic session with non-<lb/>terminal agents. During each session, vitals (heart rate [electrocardiogram or pulse oximetry],<lb/> O2 hemoglobin saturation (pulse oximetry; tongue, lip, or ear), non-invasive blood pressure<lb/> [forelimb] and temperature [rectal]) were monitored once every 15 minutes using a vitals monitor<lb/> (Surgivet, Smiths Medical, Minneapolis, MN). Respiratory rate was taken manually. The<lb/> average heart rate (mean HR) for a trial appeared to be a consistent indicator of anesthetic<lb/> plane and was later included in statistical analysis. Other vitals either did not fluctuate across<lb/> sessions or were subject to artifact and were not analyzed across sessions. During procedures<lb/> for three of the five cats, a data logger was used for continuous vitals recording once per<lb/> second and the calculation of change in heart rate over trial (ΔHR) in non-terminal studies.<lb/> Reflexes (palpebral, withdrawal, jaw tone, pupil dilation) were checked before each CMG trial.<lb/> Palpebral and withdrawal reflexes were categorized as &quot;yes (strong withdrawal)&quot;, &quot;some (weak<lb/> withdrawal)&quot; or &quot;no (no withdrawal)&quot;. Jaw tone was categorized as &quot;tight,&quot; &quot;mid&quot; (intermediate),<lb/> or &quot;loose.&quot; Pupil dilation was categorized as &quot;constricted,&quot; &quot;mid&quot; (intermediate), or &quot;dilated.&quot; In<lb/> general, as anesthetic depth increases, palpebral and withdrawal reflexes decrease, jaw tone<lb/> loosens, and pupils become more dilated <ref type="biblio">21</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<head>Data Acquisition and Analysis:<lb/></head>

			<p>Bladder pressure data was processed using MATLAB (R2019a, MathWorks, Natick, MA)<lb/> and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Bladder pressure was smoothed using a 1 second<lb/> moving average. NVCs were identified in MATLAB using the findpeaks function, defining a peak<lb/> as at least 3 cm H2O, at least 0.5 seconds away from another peak, and then manually<lb/> confirmed. To account for the range of trial lengths, NVC counts were divided by the total length<lb/> of the trial to calculate NVCs per second. To quantify overall bladder pressure trends seen<lb/> between agents, pressure slopes were calculated for three distinct time periods: (1) infusion<lb/> start to 100 seconds before void, (2) 100 to 50 seconds before void, and (3) last 50 seconds<lb/> before void. To visualize the changes seen during slope calculations over different pressure and<lb/> time ranges across cats and test sessions, the bladder pressure was normalized from 0 (start)<lb/> to peak/void (1000) on the x (time) axis. After noting that pressures did not significantly fluctuate<lb/> from resting baseline pressure until about 675 normalized time units, the 675-1000 normalized<lb/> time unit range was targeted, and the pressure was normalized from 0 to 1 within that window.<lb/> Continuous heart rate readings during non-terminal trials for the last 3 cats were also processed<lb/> similarly, but over the entire length of the trial. Statistics were analyzed using JMP Pro 14.2.0<lb/> (SAS Institution Inc. Cary, NC), using a mixed model approach, setting anesthetic agent as a<lb/> fixed variable and animal as a random variable. For analysis of bladder capacity, the cat weight<lb/> was set as an additional fixed variable. Nominal categorical data was converted to ordinal<lb/> categorical data in order to fit the mixed model. Yes/some/no, tight/mid/loose, and<lb/> constricted/mid/dilated were converted to 0/0.5/1 respectively. Pairwise comparisons were<lb/> made using Tukey&apos;s HSD. Significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05. Where relevant, data is<lb/> reported as mean ± standard deviation.<lb/></p>
