			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>Over the last ten years or so, the advent of large for-<lb/>mat near-infrared (NIR) detectors has made images at<lb/> wavelengths longer than 1 µm relatively easy to obtain.<lb/> New infrared cameras based on these detectors make it<lb/> straightforward to study statistically significant samples<lb/> of galaxies in the NIR (see e.g. <ref type="biblio">de Jong &amp; van der Kruit<lb/> 1994</ref>). The NIR wavelengths constitute the spectral re-<lb/>gion best adapted to studies of the quiescent stellar com-<lb/>ponent of galaxies, since they trace mass better than do<lb/> optical bands, being less contaminated by the low M/L<lb/> products of recent episodes of star formation. The NIR<lb/> spectral region is also relatively free of effects of dust, as<lb/> extinction at 1.65 µm is more than seven times lower than<lb/> in the B band (e.g., <ref type="biblio">Landini et al. 1984</ref>). On the negative<lb/> side, the sky brightness can be as much as ten magnitudes<lb/> brighter than in the visible; thus more sophisticated and<lb/> time-consuming observing and data reduction techniques<lb/> are required.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Since 1993 we have used NIR arrays extensively to ob-<lb/>tain images in the H bandpass of galaxies. The observing<lb/> samples were selected by choosing members of the Virgo,<lb/> Coma and A1367 clusters. In addition, we selected a sig-<lb/>nificant population of galaxies in the portion of the &quot; Great<lb/> Wall &quot; which lies in the bridge between Coma and A1367.<lb/> These latter objects can be considered isolated and will<lb/> be used as a control sample for environmental studies.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Our previous papers concentrated on spiral galaxies.<lb/> About 160 such objects observed with the Calar Alto 2.2<lb/> m telescope were reported in <ref type="biblio">Gavazzi et al. (1996c; Paper<lb/> I)</ref>; another 300, observed similarly with the TIRGO 1.5<lb/> m telescope, are given in <ref type="biblio">Gavazzi et al. (1996b; Paper II)</ref>;<lb/> and another 102 Virgo galaxies are reported in <ref type="biblio">Boselli et<lb/> al. (1997; B97)</ref>. More Calar Alto observations of 170 galax-<lb/>ies in the Virgo cluster are given in <ref type="biblio">Boselli et al. (1999,<lb/> Paper IV)</ref>. In this paper, we present 1.65 µm (H-band) sur-<lb/>face brightness measurements, obtained in 1997 at TIRGO<lb/> equipped with the Arcetri NIR camera ARNICA, of 558<lb/> galaxies which are primarily of early-type (E-S0-S0a). We<lb/> also provide several repeated measurements of late-type<lb/> objects with previously unreliable photometry. Section 2<lb/> of the present paper describes the current sample, and<lb/> the observations are outlined in Section 3. Image analysis<lb/> strategies are discussed in Section 4. Preliminary results<lb/> are given in Section 5 and summarized in Section 6. Profile<lb/> decompositions using combinations of exponential profiles<lb/> and de Vaucouleurs laws of the present data and of those<lb/> obtained similarly (Paper I, II, IV and B97) will be given<lb/> in a forthcoming paper (Paper V of this series, <ref type="biblio">Gavazzi et<lb/> al. 1999a</ref>).<lb/></p>

			<head>2. Sample selection<lb/></head>

			<p>We report on the NIR H band observations of 558<lb/> optically-selected galaxies, for the most part (457) of<lb/> early-type morphology, found in the regions of the Coma<lb/> Supercluster and of the Virgo cluster. There are 383 early-<lb/>type galaxies in the CGCG catalogue (m p ≤ 15.7) <ref type="biblio">(Zwicky<lb/> et al. 1961-68)</ref> that are members of the Coma supercluster<lb/> (18 o ≤ δ ≤ 32 o ; 11.5 h ≤ α ≤ 13.5 h ), according to <ref type="biblio">Gavazzi<lb/> et al. (1999)</ref>, i.e. with 5000 &lt; V &lt; 8000 km s -1 . Of these,<lb/> we have observed 372 objects, which constitute 97% of the<lb/> designated sample.<lb/></p>

			<p>We also observed 81 of the 98 early-type galax-<lb/>ies brighter than m p =14.0 listed in the VCC catalogue<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Binggeli et al. 1985)</ref> which are bona-fide members of the<lb/> Virgo cluster. Thus we have observed 83% of the giant<lb/> early-type galaxies in Virgo.<lb/></p>

			<p>The remaining 101 observations of spiral galaxies given<lb/> here do not form a complete sample in any sense. However,<lb/> they are necessary to define a complete data set. When<lb/> combined with data published in Papers I and II (both of<lb/> which were devoted to observations of spiral galaxies), IV<lb/> of this series and B97 (which contains mainly measure-<lb/>ments of spiral galaxies in Virgo), the NIR survey pre-<lb/>sented in this series of papers represents a complete, op-<lb/>tically selected sample of galaxies, which will be analyzed<lb/> in future papers.<lb/></p>

			<p>The first 9 columns of Table <ref type="table">1</ref> give the optical param-<lb/>eters of the 558 galaxies studied in the present work as<lb/> follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>Column 1: CGCG <ref type="biblio">(Zwicky et al. 1961-68)</ref> or VCC<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(Binggeli et al. 1985)</ref> denomination.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 2: NGC/IC names.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 3, 4: adopted (1950) celestial coordinates, mea-<lb/>sured by us or taken from NED 2 , with few arcsec uncer-<lb/>tainty.<lb/></p>

			<p>Column 5: &quot; aggregation &quot; parameter. This parameter de-<lb/>fines the membership to a group/cluster/supercluster:<lb/> CSisol, CSpairs, CSgroups indicate members of the Coma<lb/> Supercluster (5000 &lt; V &lt; 8000 km s -1 ); CSforeg means<lb/> objects in the foreground of the Coma Supercluster (V &lt;<lb/> 5000 km s -1 ) and CSbackg means objects in the back-<lb/>ground of the Coma Supercluster (V &gt; 8000 km s -1 ).<lb/> Galaxies in the Virgo region are labelled following the<lb/> membership criteria given by <ref type="biblio">Binggeli et al. (1993)</ref>: VCA,<lb/> VCB, VCM, VCW, VCW&apos;, VCSE, VCmem, are members<lb/> to the cluster A or B, to the M, W, W&apos; or South-East<lb/> clouds or are not better specified members to the Virgo<lb/> cluster respectively. NOVCC are galaxies taken from the<lb/> CGCG in the outskirts of Virgo, but outside the area cov-<lb/>ered by the VCC. VCback are galaxies in the background<lb/> of the Virgo cluster (V&gt;3000 km/sec).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 6: photographic magnitude as given in the CGCG<lb/> or in the VCC.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 7,8: for CGCG galaxies these are the major and<lb/> minor optical diameters (a 25 , b 25 ) (in arcmin) derived at<lb/> the B band 25 th mag arcsec -2 , as explained in <ref type="biblio">Gavazzi &amp;<lb/> Boselli (1996)</ref>. These diameters are consistent with those<lb/> given in the RC3. For VCC galaxies these are the diam-<lb/>eters measured on the du Pont plates at the faintest de-<lb/>tectable isophote, as listed in the VCC.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 9: morphological type.<lb/></p> 

			<head>3. Observations<lb/></head> 

			<p>The observations reported in this paper were acquired<lb/> with the 1.5 m, f/20 TIRGO telescope from March 13<lb/> to April 13, 1997, when 32 nights were allocated to the<lb/> present project. Only 22/32 nights were useful, 16 of which<lb/> were entirely or partly photometric. The seeing ranged<lb/> from 1.5 to 3.5 arcsec (FWHM) with a mean of 2.4 arc-<lb/>sec, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. These seeing conditions are mostly<lb/> due to the large pixels (∼ 1 arcsec) of ARNICA at TIRGO,<lb/> and as such represent a necessary disadvantage, because<lb/> they also provide the large field-of-view (4.1×4.1 arcmin 2 )<lb/> fundamental for our observations.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 1. The seeing distribution.<lb/></figure> 

			<p>The folded Cassegrain focus of the telescope is<lb/> equipped with the Arcetri NIR camera, ARNICA, which<lb/> relies on a 256 2 NICMOS3 array detector <ref type="biblio">(Lisi et al. 1993;<lb/> Lisi et al. 1996; Hunt et al. 1996)</ref>. With a pixel size of<lb/> 0.97 arcsec, the field-of-view is 4.1×4.1 arcmin 2 . Obtain-<lb/>ing a satisfactory background subtraction is the main dif-<lb/>ficulty of NIR observations. At 1.65 µm, the sky brightness<lb/> at the Gornergrat is ≈ 13.0-13.5 mag arcsec -2 , and varies<lb/> on time scales comparable with the typical duration of an<lb/> observation (e.g., <ref type="biblio">Wainscoat &amp; Cowie 1992</ref>). To achieve<lb/> a brightness limit 8 mag arcsec -2 fainter than the sky re-<lb/>quires an image in which the deviations from flatness do<lb/> not exceed 0.06%. Thus, data acquisition techniques must<lb/> be able to monitor the sky fluctuations and data reduction<lb/> must take these into account.<lb/></p>

			<p>To this end, we used two types of pointing sequences,<lb/> or &quot; mosaics &quot; , according to the size of the galaxy. Galaxies<lb/> with an optical diameter ≥ 1 arcmin were observed using<lb/> a sequence in which half of the time is devoted to the tar-<lb/>get, and half to the surrounding sky (hereafter denoted as<lb/> a type &quot; A &quot; mosaic) 3 . Typically eight on-source pointings<lb/> were alternated with eight on the sky, positioned along<lb/> a circular path around the galaxy and offset by 4 arcmin<lb/> from the source position. The on-source positions were<lb/> &quot; dithered &quot; by 10 arcsec in order to facilitate the elimina-<lb/>tion of bad pixels. To save telescope time, small galaxies<lb/> (with an optical diameter &lt; 1 arcmin were observed with<lb/> a pointing sequence consisting of nine pointings along a<lb/> circular path and displaced from one another by 1 arcmin<lb/> such that the target galaxy is always in the field (hereafter<lb/> denoted as a type &quot; B &quot; mosaic).<lb/></p> 

			<p>On-chip integration times were set to 6 seconds to<lb/> avoid saturation but to ensure background-limited perfor-<lb/>mance. Total integration times on-source were typically<lb/> 400 s and ranged from 150 to 950 s.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> gives the parameters relevant to the NIR ob-<lb/>servations as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>Column 10: number of frames N f combined to form the<lb/> final image (depending on the adopted mosaic).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 11: number of elementary observations (coadds)<lb/> N c . The total integration time (in seconds) is the product<lb/> of the number of coadds N c times the number of combined<lb/> frames N f times the on-chip integration time t int which<lb/> was set to 6 sec.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 12: seeing (in pixels, with 0.97 arcsec per pixel).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 13: adopted zero point (mag / sec).<lb/> Column 14-17: observing dates (day-month-1997);<lb/></p> 

			<head>3.1. Photometric calibration<lb/></head> 

			<p>Observations of the standard stars HD 84800 (H = 7.53<lb/> mag) and HD 129653 (H = 6.92 mag) from <ref type="biblio">Elias et al.<lb/> (1982)</ref> were taken hourly throughout the nights for cali-<lb/>bration purposes. The calibration stars were observed with<lb/> a third pointing sequence (mosaic type &quot; C &quot; ) which con-<lb/>sisted of five positions, starting with the star near the cen-<lb/>ter of the array, followed by positioning the star in each of<lb/> the four quadrants of the array. The telescope was defo-<lb/>cussed to avoid saturation. During the photometric nights<lb/> (i.e. those of march 20, 21, 25, 27, 29, 31 and of April<lb/> 1, 2, 6, 7 and 13) the typical uncertainty in the nightly<lb/> calibration is 0.05 mag. Those nights were mostly used to<lb/> observe galaxies with unknown H band photometry.<lb/></p> 

			<p>In the remaining non-photometric or marginally pho-<lb/>tometric nights we did not rely on the photometric calibra-<lb/>tion; instead we conservatively observed only those galax-<lb/>ies with aperture photometry available from the literature.<lb/> For these galaxies the calibration was derived from the<lb/> &quot; virtual aperture photometry &quot; (see Section 4.1 below).<lb/> Several (108) galaxies were observed in more than one<lb/> night (see Columns 14-17 in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). This was done ei-<lb/>ther to check the photometric consistency, because some<lb/> observations were taken in non-photometric conditions,<lb/> or, if the objects were fainter than average, to obtain a<lb/> longer integration. For these objects we obtained an aver-<lb/>age frame by combining the various sets of observations,<lb/> and using the zero point from the frame(s) taken under<lb/> photometric conditions.<lb/></p>

			<head>3.2. Data reduction procedures<lb/></head>

			<p>Since dome exposures cannot be obtained at TIRGO due<lb/> to the vicinity of the telescope secondary ring to the dome,<lb/> the multiplicative correction for the system response, or<lb/> flat-field (FF), was derived daily from the observations.<lb/> Many tens (typically 30 to 40) sky frames taken in sim-<lb/>ilar conditions throughout the night were combined with<lb/> a median filter. The combined frame, normalized to its<lb/> median counts was used as the flat-field frame.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The reduction procedure varied according to the type<lb/> of mosaic. For type &quot; A &quot; mosaics, the (usually eight) sky<lb/> exposures were combined with a median algorithm to form<lb/> a median sky. For type &quot; B &quot; and &quot; C &quot; mosaics, the median<lb/> sky was determined by combining all the frames in the<lb/> pointing sequence. The median algorithm is necessary to<lb/> remove unwanted star and galaxy images in the median<lb/> sky frames. The median sky was first normalized to its<lb/> median, then multiplied by the median counts of the indi-<lb/>vidual target frames. Finally this rescaled frame was sub-<lb/></p>

Such a pro-<lb/>cedure accounts for temporal variations in the sky level<lb/> which are on the order of 5% during a pointing sequence,<lb/> but introduces an additive offset which is subsequently re-<lb/>moved (see below).

Each of these corrected<lb/> frames was then analyzed for low-spatial-frequency gra-<lb/>dients, and if necessary, fitted with a two-dimensional 3<lb/> degree polynomial which was then subtracted. (We care-<lb/>fully checked that this procedure did not produce artificial<lb/> features which could disturb the photometry of the target<lb/> objects). If this process was not effective in removing the<lb/> spatial gradients, the corresponding frames were rejected<lb/> from further analysis. Finally, the corrected frames were<lb/> registered using field stars and combined with a median fil-<lb/>ter which allows bad pixel removal. Foreground stars were<lb/> eliminated by manual &quot; editing &quot; of the target frames. All<lb/> image reduction and analysis was performed in the IRAF<lb/> environment and relied on the STSDAS package. 4<lb/></p> 

			<p>We have assessed the quality of the final images both<lb/> on small spatial scales, and over the entire array. All of<lb/> the images are truly background limited, as the noise<lb/> we measure is the same as that which we would theo-<lb/>retically expect from the statistical fluctuations in the<lb/> sky background, according to <ref type="biblio">Hunt &amp; Mannucci (1998)</ref><lb/> (see Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The typical pixel to pixel fluctuations are<lb/> ∼ 21mag arcsec -2 , i.e. 0.05-0.06% of the sky.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.1. H-band magnitudes from virtual aperture photometry<lb/></head>

			<p>At the position of the galaxies&apos; centers (determined by fit-<lb/>ting a two-dimensional gaussian to the galaxies) a growth<lb/> curve was derived for each object by integrating the<lb/> counts in concentric circular rings of increasing radii. The<lb/> background was determined in a concentric object–free<lb/> corona (where the contribution from contaminating stars<lb/> is rejected by average sigma–clipping). The measurements<lb/> taken through the individual &quot; virtual circular apertures &quot;<lb/> are useful to compare with existing similarly taken mea-<lb/>surements (e.g. <ref type="biblio">Gezari et al. 1993</ref>) and for calibration pur-<lb/>poses of future observations. They are given in <ref type="table">Table 2<lb/></ref> (available only in digital format) as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>Column 1: Galaxy denomination in the CGCG (Z) or VCC<lb/> catalogues.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 2: aperture diameter in arcsec.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 3: logarithmic ratio of the adopted aperture di-<lb/>ameter to the optical (a 25 ) diameter.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 4: integrated H magnitude within the aperture.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The photometry of 159 galaxies observed under pho-<lb/>tometric conditions has been checked against 187 pub-<lb/>lished aperture photometry measurements (see <ref type="biblio">Gezari et<lb/> al. 1993</ref>). The comparison of our &quot; virtual aperture &quot; mea-<lb/>surements with the reference photometry, taken through<lb/> apertures consistent with ours, is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. On the<lb/> average we find:<lb/></p>

			<formula>H this work - H literature = -0.026 ± 0.095 mag.<lb/></formula> 

			<p>The most discrepant measurements are those taken<lb/> through small apertures (5-15 arcsec), due to a combi-<lb/>nation of seeing effects and unaccurate galaxy center-<lb/>ing. We estimate the overall photometric accuracy of our<lb/> data, including systematic errors in the calibration, to be<lb/> ≤ 0.1 mag.<lb/></p>

			<head>4.2. Isophotal radii, total magnitudes, and concentration<lb/> indices<lb/></head> 

			<p>Our NIR observations available so far (including those<lb/> given in Papers I, II and IV and in B97) were also analyzed<lb/> using a more sophisticated approach than the one adopted<lb/> here: 1) the surface brightness profiles were derived from<lb/> azimuthally averaged elliptical isophotes with center, ellip-<lb/>ticity and position angle taken as free parameters. 2) the<lb/> surface brightness profiles were decomposed into combina-<lb/>tions of exponential and de Vaucouleurs laws (or double<lb/> exponential profiles) using a fitting algorithm. We pre-<lb/>fer to postpone the discussion of these profile decomposi-<lb/>tions to a forthcoming paper (Paper V of this series; some<lb/> details of the decomposition procedures can be found in<lb/> <ref type="biblio">Scodeggio et al. 1998</ref>). However we wish to anticipate here<lb/> a few results which depend on the fitting algorithms only<lb/> as a tool necessary to extrapolate the measured photome-<lb/>try to infinity: i.e. to obtain total magnitudes, concentra-<lb/>tion indexes and also to derive isophotal radii at a given<lb/> limiting surface brightness (20.5 mag arcsec -2 in this case)<lb/> when the observations do not reach such a limit.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> gives the H band measured parameters of the ob-<lb/>served galaxies, as follows:<lb/></p>

			<p>Column 18: H B25 magnitude obtained extrapolating the<lb/> present photometric measurements to the optical diame-<lb/>ter along circular apertures as in <ref type="biblio">Gavazzi &amp; Boselli (1996)</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 19: H c<lb/> B25 magnitude computed at the optical<lb/> diameter (see Column 18) corrected for galactic and<lb/> internal extinction following <ref type="biblio">Gavazzi &amp; Boselli (1996)</ref>.<lb/> The adopted internal extinction correction is ∆m =<lb/> -2.5 D log(b/a) where D=0.17, as determined in <ref type="biblio">Boselli<lb/> &amp; Gavazzi (1994)</ref>.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 20: H T total H magnitude extrapolated to infin-<lb/>ity along either an exponential or a de Vaucouleurs r 1/4<lb/> law fitted to the outer parts of the observed radial surface<lb/> brightness profiles (see Paper V for details).<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 21: galaxy observed major (r H (20.5)) radius (in<lb/> arcsec) determined in the elliptical azimuthally–integrated<lb/> profiles as the radius at which the surface brightness<lb/> reaches 20.5 H–mag arcsec -2 . Galaxies which require a<lb/> surface brightness extrapolation larger than 0.5 mag to<lb/> reach the 20.5 th magnitude isophote are labelled -1.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Column 22: the model–independent concentration index<lb/> C 31 , as defined in <ref type="biblio">de Vaucouleurs (1977)</ref>, is the ratio be-<lb/>tween the radii that enclose 75% and 25% of the total light<lb/> H T .<lb/></p> 

			<head>5. Results<lb/></head> 

			<p>Based on the observations presented in this work, which<lb/> we reiterate does not comprise a complete sample, we de-<lb/>rive the following preliminary results.<lb/></p> 

			<head>5.1. Radii r H (20.5)<lb/></head> 

			<p>The isophotal radii in this work are derived at the 20.5<lb/> mag arcsec -2 H-band isophote, which represents a rather<lb/> bright level, even for H-band measurements. For example<lb/> in Paper I and II we were able to measure similar quanti-<lb/>ties one mag arcsec -2 fainter, i.e. up to 21.5 mag arcsec -2 .<lb/> This is not due to lower signal-to-noise of the present data<lb/> compared with the past data, but rather to the different<lb/> method adopted for deriving the light profiles. In the pre-<lb/>vious papers the radial surface brightness profiles were de-<lb/>rived by azimuthally integrating the counts in concentric<lb/> elliptical coronae of fixed center and ellipticity up to indef-<lb/>inite radii. Here, instead, the center and ellipticity are kept<lb/> as free parameters and the fitting is halted when the mean<lb/> surface brightness within a given elliptical corona equals<lb/> the corresponding rms. fluctuation. The drawback is that<lb/> the new fitting routine halts at higher surface brightnesses<lb/> than before. The lowest surface brightness reached in each<lb/> image is given in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> as a function of the integration<lb/> time.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 4. The distribution of the lowest surface brightness<lb/> reached in the outer light profiles, as a function of the exposure<lb/> time.<lb/></figure> 

			<p>The comparison between the isophotal B band<lb/> r B (25.0) = (a/2) 25 (B) radii <ref type="biblio">(Gavazzi &amp; Boselli 1996)</ref><lb/> and the infrared r H (20.5) isophotal radii determined in<lb/> this work is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>. Apart from the curva-<lb/>ture apparent at small radii, the data are consistent with<lb/> r H (20.5) = 0.7 r B (25.0) between these two arbitrary<lb/> isophotal levels.<lb/></p>

			<p>This indicates that at the adopted isophotal level, the<lb/> H observations cover a substantial fraction of the light,<lb/> and are not restricted to the bulge. The relationship be-<lb/>tween optical and H-band isophotal radii is consistent with<lb/> that expected from our limiting H surface brightness of<lb/> 20.5 mag arcsec -2 and with the B–H color of the outer<lb/> portion of normal galaxies.<lb/></p> 

			<p>The curvature seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> is only marginally an arte-<lb/>fact of the seeing: the effect is reduced slightly by removing<lb/> the objects observed in the worse seeing conditions. The<lb/> deviation from linearity is not due to an overestimate of<lb/> the H band radii, rather it reflects an underestimate of the<lb/> B band diameter of small (≤ 10 arcsec) early-type galax-<lb/>ies which are intrinsically red (see Paper V for a more<lb/> comprehensive discussion on this issue).<lb/></p>

			<figure>Fig. 5. The relation between the apparent major isophotal ra-<lb/>dius rH(20.5) as determined in the infrared (this work) and<lb/> in the optical rB(25.0). E+S0 are plotted as open circles,<lb/> S+Irr as filled circles. The solid line represents the relation<lb/> rH(20.5) = 0.7 rB(25.0).<lb/></figure> 

			<head>5.2. Magnitudes (H T , H B25 )<lb/></head> 

			<p>H B25 magnitudes listed in Column 18 of Table <ref type="table">1</ref> are ob-<lb/>tained by extrapolating the circular aperture measure-<lb/>ments to the optical r B (25.0) radius (as in <ref type="biblio">Gavazzi &amp;<lb/> Boselli 1996</ref>). H T mag instead are obtained by extrapo-<lb/>lating to infinity the magnitude integrated along elliptical<lb/> isophotes using combinations of exponential and de Vau-<lb/>couleurs laws. As expected, H T are brighter than H B25 by<lb/> 0.10 ± 0.2 mag on average.<lb/></p>

			<head>5.3. Concentration index (C 31 )<lb/></head> 

			<p>The concentration index C 31 is a measure of the shape<lb/> of light profiles in galaxies, independent of a bulge–disk<lb/> decomposition. Values larger than C 31 &gt; 2.8 indicate the<lb/> presence of substantial bulges.<lb/></p> 

			<p>We confirm the presence in our sample of a general<lb/> correlation between C 31 and the H band (H T or H B25 )<lb/> luminosity (computed from the redshift distance). We find<lb/> that C 31 generally increases toward higher absolute mag-<lb/>nitudes (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). High C 31 are found only among high lu-<lb/>minosity systems, but the converse is not true: there are<lb/> several high luminosity systems (namely late–type giant<lb/> spirals) with no or little bulge (C 31 ∼ 3).<lb/></p>

			<head>6. Summary<lb/></head> 

			<p>We have obtained images in the near-infrared H bandpass<lb/> for an optical-magnitude-selected (m p ≤ 15.7) sample of<lb/> 558 nearby (z &lt; 0.02) galaxies primarily of early-type,<lb/> in the regions of Coma and Virgo. We derived H magni-<lb/></p>

			<p>tudes at the optical radius, total H magnitudes, isopho-<lb/>tal radii at the 20.5 mag arcsec -2 isophote, and the light<lb/> concentration index C 31 . As mentioned in the Introduc-<lb/>tion, the galaxies presented in this paper do not form by<lb/> themselves a complete sample. Therefore we postpone the<lb/> comprehensive analysis of the NIR properties of galaxies<lb/> to forthcoming papers of this series. Paper V will report<lb/> on the profile decomposition.</p>
