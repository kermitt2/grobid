			<p>The previous description of REBASE in the 2007 NAR<lb/> Database Issue <ref type="biblio">(1)</ref> described 3805 biochemically or genet-<lb/>ically characterized restriction-modification (R-M)<lb/> systems and included an analysis of approximately 400<lb/> bacterial and archaeal genomes that had been deposited<lb/> in the RefSeq Database of GenBank <ref type="biblio">(2,3)</ref>. Analysis of the<lb/> available sequence information in GenBank led to the pre-<lb/>diction of 2709 restriction enzyme (R) genes and 4485<lb/> DNA methyltransferase (M) genes. These numbers have<lb/> now risen to 4990 R genes and 8080 M genes of which<lb/> 3511 R and 5497 M genes have arisen from the 1050<lb/> completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes.<lb/> These putative R-M system genes are given systematic<lb/> names according to the agreed upon nomenclature rules<lb/> <ref type="biblio">(4)</ref>. The names all carry the suffix &apos;P&apos; to indicate their<lb/> putative status. In many cases, the recognition specificity<lb/> of these systems can be assigned with some degree of<lb/> confidence because of their similarity to biochemically<lb/> well-characterized enzymes.<lb/></p>

			<p>The REBASE web site (http://rebase.neb.com)<lb/> summarizes all information known about every restriction<lb/> enzyme and any associated proteins. This includes the rec-<lb/>ognition sequences, cleavage sites, source, commercial<lb/> availability, sequence data, crystal structure information,<lb/> isoschizomers and methylation sensitivity. Within the<lb/> reference section of REBASE, links are maintained to<lb/> the full text of all papers whenever they are readily avail-<lb/>able on the web. Also, there is extensive reciprocal cross-<lb/>referencing between REBASE and NCBI, including links<lb/> to GenBank and PubMed and NCBI&apos;s LinkOut utility.<lb/> Links to other major databases such as UniProt (<ref type="formula">5</ref>),<lb/> PDB <ref type="biblio">(6)</ref> and Pfam (<ref type="formula">7</ref>) are also maintained. There are<lb/> currently 3945 biochemically or genetically characterized<lb/> restriction enzymes in REBASE and of the 3834 Type II<lb/> restriction enzymes, 299 distinct specificities are known.<lb/> Six hundred and forty one restriction enzymes are com-<lb/>mercially available, including 235 distinct specificities.<lb/></p>

			<p>As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, the rate of discovery of new<lb/> putative restriction and modification genes is rising<lb/> rapidly. In contrast, the rate at which candidates are<lb/> being characterized biochemically has actually dropped<lb/> to the level it was three decades ago. Nevertheless,<lb/> because of the large number of sequenced examples of<lb/> biochemically characterized restriction systems, the<lb/> putative recognition sequences of predicted restriction<lb/> enzymes and DNA methyltransferases can be inferred.<lb/> Currently, all new sequences entering GenBank are<lb/> checked using data mining techniques for the presence<lb/> of R-M systems and, following extensive manual<lb/> checking, the resulting inferences are all included within<lb/> REBASE where they are clearly marked as predictions.<lb/> When analyzing DNA sequence data, it is the DNA<lb/> methyltransferase genes that are the more reliable<lb/> indicators of an R-M system and the presence, proper<lb/> order and characteristic spacing of well-conserved motifs<lb/> that are used to suggest likely candidates.<lb/></p>

			<p>It should be noted that at the present time it is not<lb/> possible to distinguish DNA methyltransferases reliably<lb/> enough to be completely confident in the assignments.<lb/> Some RNA and protein methyltransferases can sometimes<lb/> be confused for DNA methyltransferases as is widely<lb/> reflected by the annotations found in GenBank files.<lb/> In general, REBASE takes a liberal approach and<lb/> includes all likely candidates until it becomes clear that<lb/> non-DNA methyltransferases have been included<lb/> erroneously and then these are culled from the database.<lb/> The more widely divergent genes that encode the restric-<lb/>tion enzymes always reside close to the genes for their<lb/> cognate methyltransferases, but often they cannot be<lb/> recognized directly because they are a rapidly evolving<lb/> set of genes and frequently lack any sequence similarity<lb/> to any other genes in GenBank. However, other methods<lb/> can sometimes be used to infer their presence such as the<lb/> analysis of shotgun sequence data from which missing<lb/> clones can be inferred to be caused by the presence of<lb/> active restriction enzyme genes <ref type="biblio">(8)</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>Given the wealth of experimental data, both published<lb/> and unpublished, contained within REBASE, it can be<lb/> an especially valuable resource during the annotation of<lb/> bacterial and archaeal genomes. With the plethora of<lb/> restriction systems that occur in all sequenced microbial<lb/> genomes, annotators are encouraged to use the resources<lb/> of the REBASE database or to contact the REBASE staff<lb/> if help is needed. Custom analyses of unpublished genome<lb/> sequence data are carried out upon request.<lb/></p>

			<p>From the REBASE web site users have a variety of<lb/> resources available that facilitate the analysis of<lb/> sequence information including tools for analyzing<lb/> sequences (REBASE tools) that allow restriction enzyme<lb/> recognition sites to be found in submitted sequences<lb/> (NEBcutter) and an implementation of BLAST to allow<lb/> searching against all sequences in REBASE. Specialty lists<lb/> of sequence data (REBASE lists) such as all known Type<lb/> II restriction enzyme genes, all known Type I specificity<lb/> subunit genes, etc., are available for download.<lb/></p>

			<p>The coming year will see some major additions to<lb/> REBASE in terms of new sequence acquisitions, such as<lb/> the inclusion of all metagenomic sequence data (only par-<lb/>tially analyzed to date) and a tool to permit users to<lb/> perform their own analysis of newly sequenced genomes.<lb/></p>

			<figure>Figure 1. The graph shows the numbers of R-M systems entering REBASE since its inception in 1975. The open bars show systems that have been<lb/> characterized either biochemically or genetically. The black bars show the increasing accumulation of potential R-M systems that have been found<lb/> by bioinformatic analysis of sequences in GenBank. The surge in 2004 represents the addition of metagenomic sequences from the Sargasso Sea<lb/> collecting expedition <ref type="biblio">(9)</ref>.</figure>
