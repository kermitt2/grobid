			<head level="1">INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Hypercementosis is characterized by cementum<lb/> formation beyond the physiologic limits of the tooth. This<lb/> excessive amount of cementum might lead to an abnormal<lb/> thickness of the apex that becomes round-shaped and/or with<lb/> the root appearance altered macroscopically <ref type="biblio">6</ref> .<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The incidence of hypercementosis by race or population<lb/> group has not yet been established. Grzesik, et al. <ref type="biblio">8</ref> studied<lb/> the frequency of this phenomenon in 137 individuals and<lb/> observed an average of 3.8 teeth with hypercementosis per<lb/> individual aged approximately 47 years, and the premolars<lb/> were the most affected teeth <ref type="biblio">8</ref> . Other studies reported root<lb/> hypercementosis in 84% out of 104 Barbados slave skeletal<lb/> collection from the 17th to 19th centuries <ref type="biblio">5</ref> . Root<lb/> hypercementosis was also diagnosed in 10 out of 54<lb/> specimens gathered from prehistoric coastal populations of<lb/> Texas, USA <ref type="biblio">4</ref> .<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The origin of hypercementosis is attributed to conditions<lb/> such as functional stress due to occlusion forces <ref type="biblio">4,5,7,19</ref> ,<lb/> continuous dental eruption <ref type="biblio">2,3,9,12</ref> , incorporation of periodontal<lb/> cementicles during physiologic cementum deposition <ref type="biblio">6</ref> ,<lb/> reactionary deposition in response to periapical<lb/> inflammatory processes <ref type="biblio">18</ref> , systemic factors such as<lb/> atherosclerosis, acromegaly, deforming arthritis,<lb/> hypertrophic arthritis, thyroid diseases and Paget&apos;s<lb/> disease <ref type="biblio">1,10,13,17</ref> . Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the alterations in dental root<lb/> morphology due to hypercementosis.<lb/></p>
			
			<p>Radiographically, hypercementosis does not alter the<lb/> biologic width between the root surface, the periodontal<lb/> ligament, and the alveolar bone. Although hypercementosis<lb/> can be identified radiographically, it is not possible to<lb/> estimate the amount of extra cementum present in the<lb/> affected root because dentin and cementum have the same<lb/> radiodensity <ref type="biblio">7,14</ref> .<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>Microscopic studies about hypercementosis have<lb/> reported thick layers of cementum characterized by<lb/> deposition of symmetric, highly basophilic lines parallel to<lb/> dentin surface <ref type="biblio">6,7</ref> . Occasionally, atypical cementum<lb/> depositions can be identified in focal areas as external<lb/> cementum projections. The presence of blood vessels and<lb/> nervous filaments associated to irregular apical cementum<lb/> deposition could contribute to the formation of multiple<lb/> foramina during cementum deposition, due to<lb/> hypercementosis, originating the apical deltas <ref type="biblio">19</ref> .<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The lack of recent studies referring to this subject, added<lb/> to the potential clinical implications stimulate the evaluation<lb/> of morphologic characteristics of the apical root third and<lb/> root canal in teeth with hypercementosis. The purpose of<lb/> this study was to examining by scanning electron microscopy<lb/> (SEM) the external anatomy of the apical third of teeth with<lb/> hypercementosis, assessing the existence of any relationship<lb/> between hypercementosis and the diameter of the main<lb/> foramen and the presence of apical foramina. These<lb/> morphological features might implicate specific aspects on<lb/> endodontic therapeutic techniques.<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">MATERIAL AND METHODS<lb/></head>

			<p>Twenty-eight teeth with hypercementosis were selected<lb/> from the archives of the Discipline of Oral Pathology at the<lb/> Bauru School of Dentistry, SP, Brazil. Hypercementosis<lb/> distribution was classified in the present study as: club shape,<lb/> focal or circular cementum hyperplasia (CCH). The<lb/> longitudinal extension of club shape hypercementosis in the<lb/> root thirds was graded as mild, moderate and severe.<lb/> Regarding the tooth type, the sample comprised: 8 maxillary<lb/> molars, 6 mandibular molars, 6 maxillary premolars, 1<lb/> mandibular premolar, 4 canines and 3 residual roots. Sample<lb/> distribution according to hypercementosis type, tooth type<lb/> and number of evaluated roots is displayed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.<lb/></p>
			
			<p>The teeth had the crown and part of the roots sectioned<lb/> transversally with carborundum disk and discarded, leaving<lb/> 5-mm-long apical root segments. This procedure was<lb/> necessary in order to fit the specimen in a metallic base<lb/> used for SEM analysis. A total of 41 specimens were<lb/> obtained from 46 roots.<lb/> The specimens were dehydrated by immersion in an<lb/> ascending ethanol series (70, 80, 90 and 100%), sputter-<lb/>coated with gold and examined with a scanning electron<lb/> microscope (Zeiss DSM-940A, Oberkochen,</p>

			<p>Germany)<lb/> operating at 15kV. The following aspects were examined in<lb/> the SEM analysis: the contour and regularity of the root<lb/> surface; presence of resorption; presence and the number<lb/> of root foramina, and the diameter of the main foramen.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Club Shape Hypercementosis<lb/></head>

			<p>Out of 12 specimen with mild club shape<lb/> hypercementosis 7 (58.3%) exhibited the apical foramen, 6<lb/> (50%) foramina and 3 (25%) had the obliteration of the main<lb/> foramen. Four 4 specimens (33.3%) presented more than<lb/> one of the studied aspects. Regarding the main foramen<lb/> diameter, a 150-300 µm range was found. The apical surface<lb/> of the teeth with this type of hypercementosis showed<lb/> sometimes a regular or an irregular aspect.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>It was not possible to observe the apical foramen in only<lb/> 1 specimen of teeth with moderate club shape<lb/> hypercementosis. The foramen diameter varied between 150<lb/> and 450 µm. A larger number of roots presented irregular<lb/> surfaces due to apical resorption as well as the union of the<lb/> roots by the cementum and the presence of an apical main<lb/> foramen and foramina (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/></p>
			
			<p>Seven specimens presented severe club shape<lb/> hypercementosis. Only 3 cases (42.8%) showed apical main<lb/> foramen and apical foramina. The main foramen diameter<lb/> varied between 100 and 300 µm. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the presence<lb/> of tiny foramina at the apex of the mesiobuccal root of a<lb/> maxillary molar. A mineralized structure partially<lb/> obliterating the apical foramina was observed in 1 specimen.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">CCH Hypercementosis<lb/></head>

			<p>The CCH type hypercementosis presented depressions<lb/> close to the apical foramen and thick cementum grossly<lb/> deposited on the lateral surface of the root. Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref> presents<lb/> buccal roots of a maxillary molar with depressions close to<lb/> the apical foramen and a thick cementum layer on the lateral<lb/> root surface. The average diameter of the main apical<lb/> foramen was 325 µm, and only 3 specimens (42.85%)<lb/> presented foramina. A mandibular molar and a residual root<lb/> also presented irregularities due to the presence of areas of<lb/> resorption.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Focal hypercementosis<lb/></head>

			<p>Regular foramina were observed in the teeth with focal<lb/> hypercementosis. The maxillary canines showed foramina<lb/> in areas of irregular cementum deposition (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Data<lb/> referring to the main apical foramen and foramina are<lb/> displayed presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>Although there are not many studies regarding this<lb/> subject, hypercementosis can be considered as a common<lb/> finding in endodontic daily practice. The impact of<lb/> hypercementosis on endodontic prognosis and its direct<lb/> influence on therapeutic procedures still unclear <ref type="biblio">20</ref> . Whether<lb/> to keep instrumentation and root canal filling above or<lb/> beyond the cementum-dentin-canal junction in teeth with<lb/> hypercementosis is a difficult clinical choice. The apical<lb/> limits for root canal preparation depend on different<lb/> reference landmarks <ref type="biblio">16</ref> , and hypercementosis might impair<lb/> such decisions.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>In the present study, SEM analysis of the root apex of<lb/> permanent teeth with hypercementosis provided a rapid<lb/> evaluation of the structure with identification of the main<lb/> foramen and apical foramina, and determination of their<lb/> dimensions. Moreover how and where the apical foramen<lb/> and accessory foramina are displaced due to<lb/> hypercementosis, and possible variations related to its<lb/> morphotypes were observed. Therefore, knowing the apical<lb/> surface of teeth with hypercementosis is important for<lb/> endodontic treatment planning.<lb/></p>

			<p>The diameter of the main apical foramen ranged in our<lb/> study from 100 to 500 µm. Openings with diameters inferior<lb/> to 100 µm were considered as apical foramina <ref type="biblio">15</ref> . The<lb/> presence of apical foramina in areas with hypercementosis<lb/> would indicate that cementum deposition occurred<lb/> respecting the neurovascular supply <ref type="biblio">18</ref> . In the present study,<lb/> the observation of apical foramina in 24 specimens supports<lb/> this idea. The absence of cementum deposition obliterating<lb/> those foramina may be related by cytokines and growth<lb/> factors released by endothelial cells and nervous branches <ref type="biblio">8</ref> .<lb/> Partial or total obliteration of the apical foramina found in<lb/> the present study could be a reactive response to the cause<lb/> of the tooth extraction <ref type="biblio">8</ref> .<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>Most root apexes of teeth with mild club shape<lb/> hypercementosis did not present surface irregularities and<lb/> cementum resorption, though presenting a large number of<lb/> apical foramina. Moderate club shape hypercementosis<lb/> showed irregular areas and apical foramina. The severe club<lb/> shape hypercementosis presented a decrease in the number<lb/> and sometimes obliteration of the apical foramen.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The present study found that the circular cementum<lb/> hyperplasia type of hypercementosis was not associated with<lb/> apical resorption. Unless proven otherwise, reactive<lb/> mechanisms due to chronic periapical lesions can be<lb/> involved in the process. This type of hypercementosis might<lb/> represent additional anatomic niches to bacterial<lb/> colonization during root canal infection, which contributes<lb/> to the presence of refractory lesions <ref type="biblio">21</ref> .<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The focal type of hypercementosis presents foramina<lb/> on its surface, even when sidelong located on the roots. This<lb/> observation warns for the development of endo-perio lesions<lb/> if these openings are be reached by bacteria and its toxic<lb/> products <ref type="biblio">11,21</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">CONCLUSIONS<lb/></head>

			<p>The detection of a large number of foramina in the apical<lb/> third of teeth with hypercementosis or even the possible<lb/> existence of apical foramen obliteration contributes to<lb/> understand the difficulties faced during endodontic treatment<lb/> of these cases. Constant research seeking the development<lb/> of techniques and materials that provide a correct<lb/> instrumentation and filling of these teeth should be<lb/> encouraged.</p>
