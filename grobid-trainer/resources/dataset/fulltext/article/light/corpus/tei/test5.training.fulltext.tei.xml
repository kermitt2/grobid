			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Although breast cancer has conventionally been classified based<lb/> on the presence or absence of the estrogen receptor (ER),<lb/> progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor<lb/> receptor 2 (HER2), recent studies have indicated that the genomic<lb/> landscape of breast cancer extends far beyond these 3 receptors. <ref type="biblio">1<lb/></ref> Genomic profiling of tumor specimens has helped identify other<lb/> targets that may serve as driver mutations for the development of<lb/> breast cancer, contributing to the heterogeneity of this disease. <ref type="biblio">1-4<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>The androgen receptor (AR) may be expressed in breast cancer.<lb/> Lehmann and colleagues identified a subtype of triple-negative<lb/> breast cancer (TNBC) characterized by the presence of the<lb/> androgen receptor (AR) and expression of other luminal genes<lb/> termed the luminal-androgen receptor (LAR) subtype. This<lb/> expression-based subtype was subsequently confirmed by other<lb/> authors. <ref type="biblio">1,2<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>A better understanding of the relationship of AR, clinical<lb/> characteristics, and patient outcomes is needed to further<lb/> individualize patient care based on tumor biology. A recent study<lb/> demonstrated that varying subtypes of TNBC may respond<lb/> differently to neoadjuvant therapy. <ref type="biblio">5</ref> It is likely that varying<lb/> subtypes within each of the conventional types of breast cancer<lb/> (hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2+, TNBC) may have<lb/> different clinical and prognostic features, and AR expression may<lb/> factor into this heterogeneity, across breast cancer subtypes. In<lb/> this study, we evaluated associations between AR gene expression<lb/> in primary breast cancer, clinical characteristics, and patient<lb/> outcomes in a well characterized subset of patients with early<lb/> stage breast cancer in the I-SPY 1 cohort. We also explored gene<lb/> correlations with AR and selected other genes involved in the<lb/> development of breast cancer, using three publically available<lb/> databases including I-SPY 1 (Investigation of Serial Studies to<lb/> Predict Your Therapeutic Response With Imaging and Molecular<lb/> Analysis), <ref type="biblio">6,7</ref> METABRIC, <ref type="biblio">4</ref> and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). <ref type="biblio">8<lb/></ref> </p>

			<head>RESULTS<lb/></head> 

			<head>I-SPY 1 tumor characteristics<lb/></head>

			<p>Of the 149 patients with microarray data available, 25% (37) were<lb/> TNBC, 30% (45) were HER2+, and 58% (86) were hormone<lb/> receptor (HR)+. Of the patients with TNBC 86% were found to be<lb/> basal by expression profiling.<lb/></p>

			<head>Association between AR expression and primary tumor<lb/> characteristics<lb/> </head>

			<p>In the I-SPY 1 dataset, AR expression was found to be significantly<lb/> lower in TNBC (i.e. HR-/HER2-) than HR+/HER2- and HER2+<lb/> disease (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>, p &lt; 0.00001), as expected and concordant with<lb/> previous literature. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> When evaluated by intrinsic subtype, AR<lb/> expression was the lowest in basal breast cancer (Fig. <ref type="figure">1b</ref>, p &lt;<lb/> 0.00001). Significantly higher AR expression was also observed in<lb/> grade I/II versus grade III tumors (Fig. <ref type="figure">1c</ref>, p &lt; 0.00001), and was<lb/> associated with older age &gt;50 (median AR expression, age &gt;50:<lb/> 0.36 vs. age ≤50: -0.35, p = 0.05). These findings were also<lb/> observed in METABRIC. Additionally, in I-SPY 1 higher AR<lb/> expression was found in node negative versus node positive<lb/> disease (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref>, p = 0.006); no association was seen with<lb/> menopausal status (p = 0.70), clinical stage (p = 0.31), or lympho-<lb/>vascular invasion (p = 0.22).<lb/></p>

			<head>Association between AR expression with patient chemotherapy<lb/> response and outcome<lb/> </head>

			<p>No significant association was observed between AR expression<lb/> and pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant<lb/> chemotherapy (median AR expression, pCR: -0.81 vs. non-pCR:<lb/> 0.24, p = 0.12). At an optimal cut off point that maximizes survival<lb/> differences between AR-stratified groups (-0.89), higher AR<lb/> expression (&gt;-0.89) was associated with better recurrence-free<lb/> survival (RFS) (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>, log-rank p = 0.0007). In a multivariable Cox<lb/> model adjusting for HR/HER2 subtypes, high AR expression<lb/> </p>

			<p>remained significantly associated with better RFS (Wald test p =<lb/> 0.01), suggesting that AR expression has prognostic value<lb/> independent of receptor subtypes. The Kaplan-Meier survival<lb/> plots of the AR-High vs. Low groups within each HR/<lb/> HER2 subtypes are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2b-d</ref>. High AR expression has<lb/> a significant or strong trend for association with better outcomes<lb/> within the HER2+ and HR+/HER2-, but not the HR-/HER2-<lb/>subtype (likely due to the small number of HR-/HER2-patients<lb/> with AR expression above -0.89).<lb/></p>

			<head>Gene correlations with AR expression<lb/></head>

			<p>We determined correlations between the gene expression of AR<lb/> and a set of 79 selected genes which may be involved in the<lb/> development of breast cancer, using the I-SPY 1, METABRIC, and<lb/> TCGA datasets in the population as a whole, and in the triple<lb/> negative (TN) cohorts of METABRIC and TCGA. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> shows the<lb/> Pearson correlation coefficient of genes showing significant<lb/> correlation with AR expression in ≥2 datasets.<lb/></p>

			<p>AR gene expression positively correlated with the expression of<lb/> multiple luminal genes including FOXA1, GATA3, AGR2, PIP, CA12,<lb/> ESR1, PGR, TOX3, MUC1, DHRS2, ITGB5, CCND1, and RET as well as<lb/> with the expression of steroid hormone genes such as ADRA2A,<lb/> PTGER3, GHR, and ADRB2. In addition, AR gene expression<lb/> positively correlated with the expression of HER2 pathway genes<lb/> including ERBB2, ERBB3, and ERBB4, and the expression of<lb/> TNFSF10, KRAS, and PTEN. Most these gene correlations were<lb/> also apparent in the TN cohorts.<lb/></p>

			<p>Significant inverse gene correlations with AR were noted with<lb/> the basal genes FOXC1, MYC, HORMAD1, SERPINB5, SOX10, ELF5,<lb/> VTCN1, SOX6, SOX8, TUBB2B, KIT, KRT5, and KRT14; in most cases,<lb/> these were observed in the TN cohorts as well. AR gene expression<lb/> also inversely correlated with the expression of DNA damage<lb/> repair genes, TOP2A and the PARPi-7 gene signature in the<lb/> population as a whole, and in the TN cohorts alone. Finally, a<lb/> significant inverse correlation between AR gene expression and<lb/> the expression of CRYAB was observed, both in the population as<lb/> a whole, and in the TN cohorts alone.<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, significant inverse correlations of AR expression<lb/> with mesenchymal genes, CDK6, EGFR, and PTGFR, and immune<lb/> genes FOXP3, RARRES1, CXCL9, CXCL10, STAT5A, STAT1, CTLA4,<lb/> PSMB9, LCK, CD2, and PDCD1 were noted; however, these<lb/> correlations were generally not seen in the TN cohorts, suggesting<lb/> that this may be related to HR/HER2 status rather than AR<lb/> expression.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>The androgen receptor may characterize a discrete subtype of<lb/> breast cancer. In this study, we analyzed gene expression in the AR<lb/> pathway in patients enrolled in I-SPY 1, and utilized the METABRIC<lb/> and TCGA datasets for validation. In both the I-SPY 1 and<lb/> METABRIC datasets, we noted a lower expression of AR in TNBC<lb/></p>

			<p>than in HR+/HER2- and HER2+ disease, and the lowest<lb/> expression in basal type breast cancer. Similarly, other authors<lb/> have noted increased expression of AR in HR+ than ER-disease, <ref type="biblio">10-<lb/>13</ref> and a lower expression of AR in TNBC. <ref type="biblio">9<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>We also observed that AR expression correlated with features of<lb/> less aggressive disease when evaluated across subtypes, with<lb/> higher expression in grade I/II versus III tumors in both I-SPY 1 and<lb/> METABRIC, and higher expression in node negative versus node<lb/> positive tumors in I-SPY 1. Our findings are concordant with those<lb/> of other authors who have demonstrated increased AR expression<lb/> in well differentiated tumors <ref type="biblio">11,14</ref> and node negative disease. <ref type="biblio">13,15<lb/></ref> Additionally, higher AR expression correlated with older age (&gt;50)<lb/> in both I-SPY 1 and METABRIC, concordant with other data-<lb/>sets. <ref type="biblio">14,16</ref> We did not find a correlation of increased AR expression<lb/> with lower disease stage in I-SPY 1, although others have observed<lb/> this finding. <ref type="biblio">15<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>In concordance with the association of AR expression with<lb/> lower risk disease, we demonstrated that higher AR expression<lb/> correlated with better RFS in the I-SPY 1 dataset. The prognostic<lb/> significance is particularly interesting as the patients in the I-SPY 1<lb/> cohort were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and AR<lb/> expression was not associated with higher rates of pathologic<lb/> complete response, suggesting that the prognostic impact may<lb/> not be as tightly related to chemotherapy response. The<lb/> association between AR and receptor subtypes may be a potential<lb/> confounding factor as the subtypes have distinct pathologic<lb/> complete response rates and prognosis. Indeed, AR expression<lb/> was high in HR+/HER2- patients who had the lowest pathologic<lb/> complete response rates but the best prognosis. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> Nevertheless, AR<lb/> remained an independent prognostic factor in a Cox model<lb/> adjusting for receptor subtypes.<lb/></p>

			<p>However, a caveat to these findings is that given the sample<lb/> size of the I-SPY1 dataset (n = 149), the number of patients with<lb/> various subtypes is small, limiting our ability to draw firm<lb/> conclusions about the impact of AR gene expression on outcomes.<lb/> Additionally, the cut point used for AR gene expression in this<lb/> analysis was data-derived and therefore the outcome data are<lb/> hypothesis generating and require validation in a different cohort<lb/> of patients. We recognize that I-SPY1 has a higher proportion of<lb/> high risk patients (due to the eligibility criteria of ≥3 cm and the<lb/> subtype distribution has a lower proportion of HR+/HER2-<lb/> tumors than one would expect based on the general population.<lb/> However, the association between AR gene expression and<lb/> subtypes (receptor or intrinsic), grade, and age were observed in<lb/> both the I-SPY 1 and METABRIC, which has a much higher<lb/> proportion (71%) of HR+/HER2- cases. Based on this assessment,<lb/> it is unlikely these findings are attributable to the skewed subtype<lb/> distribution of the I-SPY 1 cases.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nevertheless, the majority of literature also suggests that AR<lb/> positivity may be associated with better outcomes. Several recent<lb/> studies have demonstrated an improvement in both disease free<lb/> survival (DFS) and/or overall survival (OS) in AR positive<lb/> tumors. <ref type="biblio">12,14,17-21</ref> However, some authors have demonstrated the<lb/> opposite finding, i.e. that AR over-expression is associated with<lb/> worse survival outcomes, including an association with poor OS in<lb/> one study <ref type="biblio">22</ref> (149 patient study), and worse DFS in AR + TNBC in<lb/> 2 studies (Asano et al. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> (61 patient study) and Jiang et al. <ref type="biblio">23</ref> (137<lb/> patient study)), with all of these studies utilizing immunohisto-<lb/>chemical (IHC) testing for AR assessment. In addition to population<lb/></p>

			<p>differences and variations in treatment patterns, a possible<lb/> explanation for these discordant findings is variability in the IHC<lb/> methodology used to assess AR expression. The majority of the<lb/> studies in the literature have relied upon IHC to assess tumor AR<lb/> status. Kim&apos;s meta-analysis <ref type="biblio">17</ref> exemplifies the variability that may<lb/> occur in assessing AR positivity using IHC expression, as the<lb/> 11 studies utilizing IHC that were included defined expression in<lb/> several different ways. Clearly there is not a consensus definition<lb/> for AR positivity by IHC, and in prospective clinical trials, the<lb/> optimal approach to defining AR positivity is also still being<lb/> debated, with recent clinical trials defining AR+ disease as<lb/> ≥0-10% by IHC or by utilizing a genomic profiling assay. <ref type="biblio">24-26</ref> An<lb/> advantage of the I-SPY 1 database is that AR positivity was defined<lb/> using expression microarrays, which have less variability than non-<lb/>standardized IHC analyses.<lb/> </p>

			<p>Consistent with our findings that AR expression is lower in triple<lb/> negative and basal subtype breast cancer, using the I-SPY 1,<lb/> METABRIC, and TCGA datasets (defining a positive gene correla-<lb/>tion as one seen in ≥2 datasets), we were able to demonstrate that<lb/> the gene expression of AR positively correlates with the<lb/> expression of a multitude of luminal genes. As expected, AR<lb/> expression also correlated with the gene expression of other<lb/> steroid hormones. AR also anti-correlated with basal, mesenchy-<lb/>mal, and immune genes. Many of these observations were also<lb/> noted in the TNBC cohorts of METABRIC and TCGA, suggesting<lb/> that AR receptor positivity may define a subset of TNBC with<lb/> luminal features consistent with the previously described LAR<lb/> subtype of TNBC. <ref type="biblio">1,10<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>Understanding AR+ disease is particularly important in TNBC<lb/> where the mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy, and few<lb/> targeted therapies are available. A recent phase II study evaluated<lb/> the use of bicalutamide, an androgen antagonist, in patients with<lb/> AR+/ER-metastatic breast cancer, defining AR positivity as IHC<lb/> &gt;10%. <ref type="biblio">24</ref> Altogether 424 patients with ER-/PR-breast cancer were<lb/> screened of which 12% were AR positive. A clinical benefit rate<lb/> (CBR) of 19% (95% CI: 7-39%) was noted in the 26 evaluable<lb/> patients, and the median PFS was 12 weeks (95% CI: 11-22 weeks).<lb/> </p>

			<p>A second phase II study evaluated enzalutamide, an androgen<lb/> receptor inhibitor, in advanced AR + TNBC. <ref type="biblio">26</ref> In the 118 intent-to-<lb/>treat population (AR &gt;0% by IHC), the CBR at 16 weeks was 25%<lb/> (95% CI: 17-33%) and median PFS was 2.9 months (95% CI:<lb/> 1.9-3.7 months), and these endpoints were slightly improved in<lb/> the evaluable population of 78 patients (AR ≥10% by IHC) where<lb/> the CBR at 16 weeks was 33% (95% CI: 23-45%) and the median<lb/> PFS was 3.3 months (95% CI: 1.9-4.1 months). Using a genomic<lb/> assay for AR expression (PREDICT AR+), 56 patients with a positive<lb/> PREDICT AR assay had a clinical benefit rate of 39% at 16 weeks,<lb/> and a median PFS of 16.1 weeks. <ref type="biblio">25</ref> A third study evaluated<lb/> seviteronel, a selective CYP17 lyase and AR inhibitor in advanced<lb/> breast cancer, including TNBC, demonstrating the initial safety and<lb/> efficacy in TNBC (2 patients with clinical benefit at 4 months). <ref type="biblio">27<lb/></ref> These findings suggest potential value for therapies targeted to<lb/> AR. While response rates may be low, some of them are durable<lb/> which is encouraging for TNBC. Additional studies are exploring<lb/> orteronel in TNBC disease, <ref type="biblio">28</ref> as well as combination therapy in AR+<lb/> TNBC, including a study of enzalutamide and paclitaxel in the pre-<lb/>operative setting <ref type="biblio">29</ref> and one study evaluating enobosarm, a<lb/> selective androgen receptor modulator, with pembrolizumab, an<lb/> immunotherapy agent. <ref type="biblio">30<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>However, better definitions of AR positivity are clearly required<lb/> to identify patients likely to benefit from AR targeted therapies.<lb/> Our work establishes the feasibility in utilizing gene expression<lb/> microarrays for evaluating AR expression in tumor tissue, and this<lb/> is one potential platform that could be considered in future trials,<lb/> as it may circumvent the issue of non-standardization of<lb/> immunohistochemical assays to identify patients who may benefit<lb/> from AR blockade. However, further research is needed to<lb/> compare AR IHC and genomic assays. Unfortunately, this could<lb/> not be done using the I-SPY1 dataset as AR IHC results are not<lb/> available for this cohort. However, we noted a 0.73 correlation<lb/> coefficient between AR protein level as assessed using reverse<lb/> phase protein array (RPPA) and AR gene expression levels in TCGA<lb/> cohort. Additional research is needed to help AR gene expression<lb/> levels translate into routine clinical practice, similar to other<lb/> expression-based multi-gene signatures such as the Oncotype and<lb/> MammaPrint which are used in clinical decision making. The<lb/> development of a validated AR gene expression signature or<lb/> validated AR IHC threshold may enable clinicians to identify those<lb/> patients with metastatic breast cancer who may benefit from AR<lb/> targeted therapies, and for earlier stage disease, to aid in risk<lb/> prognostication.<lb/></p>

			<head>METHODS<lb/></head>

			<p>Due to the retrospective nature of this study using only publicly available<lb/> data, ethics approval for the study was not required.<lb/></p>

			<head>Study population<lb/></head>

			<p>The I-SPY 1 (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic<lb/> Response With Imaging and Molecular Analysis) study was a multicenter<lb/> initiative performed by the American College of Radiology Imaging<lb/> Network (ACRIN), Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE),<lb/> and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB). The design of this trial is<lb/> described elsewhere. <ref type="biblio">6,7</ref> In summary, I-SPY 1 enrolled patients with early<lb/> stage breast cancer and ≥3.0 cm of disease in breast, without evidence of<lb/> distant metastases. Patients underwent a core biopsy of their breast tumor<lb/> at the time of enrollment, then during, and after completing neoadjuvant<lb/> chemotherapy. Patients received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant anthracycline<lb/> plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with 95% receiving a taxane prior<lb/> to undergoing surgery. Starting in 2005, patients with HER2+ disease also<lb/> received trastuzumab. Following surgery, patients received adjuvant<lb/> chemotherapy, trastuzumab, hormonal therapy (given to all patients with<lb/> HR+ disease), and/or radiation per physician discretion.<lb/></p>

			<head>I-SPY 1 gene expression dataset<lb/></head>

			<p>For 149 patients enrolled in I-SPY 1 (GSE22226), high quality gene<lb/> expression data, assayed with the Agilent 44K arrays, was generated from<lb/> the pre-neoadjuvant treatment biopsies; the clinical features of these 149<lb/> patients did not vary significantly from the total sample size of 221 patients<lb/> evaluable. Previous studies have described the methodology by which the<lb/> microarray data was generated and processed, and the manner in which<lb/> molecular profiling was performed. <ref type="biblio">6</ref> Specifically, the expression of AR was<lb/> taken as the median-centered log2-scaled loess-normalized expression<lb/> value of the A_23_P113111 probe.<lb/></p>

			<head>METABRIC gene expression dataset<lb/></head>

			<p>Normalized expression matrices of the METABRIC discovery and validation<lb/> cohorts, generated on the HT-12 v3 platform were obtained from http://<lb/> www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/ (accession number EGAS00000000083). <ref type="biblio">4</ref> ComBat was<lb/> used for batch adjustment when combining the discovery and validation<lb/> cohorts to yield a dataset containing 1992 samples. Data was annotated<lb/> using the corresponding array annotation file from GEO, and genes<lb/> represented by multiple probes are collapsed by averaging. The normal-<lb/>ized, batch-adjusted, gene-level expression data was median-centered<lb/> prior to analysis.<lb/></p>

			<head>TCGA gene expression dataset<lb/></head>

			<p>Normalized gene-level expression data, assayed by RNA-sequencing, for<lb/> 817 primary breast cancers analyzed as part of the TCGA program was<lb/> obtained from the TCGA data portal website (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.<lb/> gov/tcga). Details of the data processing can be found in <ref type="biblio">Ciriello et al. 8<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>Association between AR primary tumor expression, clinical and<lb/> tumor characteristics, chemotherapy response, and outcome<lb/> Associations between AR expression and clinical and tumor characteristics<lb/> were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (for two-level factors) or<lb/> the Kruskal-Wallis test (for multi-level factors). The clinical characteristics<lb/> assessed in both I-SPY and METABRIC datasets included: patient age (≤50<lb/> or &gt;50), menopausal status, clinical stage (stage I/I vs. III or inflammatory),<lb/> tumor HR and HER2 status, intrinsic subtype (basal vs. non basal), nodal<lb/> status (node positive vs. node negative), histologic grade (grade I/II vs.<lb/> grade III).<lb/></p>

			<p>In addition, in the I-SPY 1 dataset, the associations between AR and<lb/> tumor lymphovascular invasion (presence vs. absence), as well as<lb/> chemotherapy response (pathologic complete response vs. not) were<lb/> assessed. We also evaluated the association of AR expression and<lb/> recurrence-free survival (RFS). First, we identified an optimal AR cut-point<lb/> which maximizes the survival difference between the AR-stratified groups.<lb/> Kaplan Meier survival curves were constructed to visualize the survival<lb/> differences between AR-stratified groups in the overall I-SPY cohort and<lb/> within HR/HER2 subtypes. Significance in curve separation was assessed<lb/> using a log-rank test. A multivariate Cox analysis was used to evaluate the<lb/> association between AR and RFS, adjusting for HR/HER2 subtype.<lb/></p>

			<head>Determination of external gene correlations with AR expression<lb/></head>

			<p>We determined correlations between the gene expression of AR and a<lb/> selected set of genes that may be involved in the development of breast<lb/> cancer, including genes shown to be associated with the luminal,<lb/> mesenchymal, basal, and immune subtypes of TNBC, 2 as well as DNA<lb/> damage repair deficiency genes including TDG and a seven gene<lb/> signature shown to be associated with response to the poly ADP ribose<lb/> polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib, the PARPi-7. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> This signature was<lb/> calculated on median-centered expression data in simplified form as<lb/> PARPi-7 = -0.5320*BRCA1 + 0.5806*CHEK2 + 0.0713*MAPKAPK2 -<lb/> 0.1396*MRE11A - 0.1976*NBN - 0.3937*TDG -0.2335*XPA. Gene corre-<lb/>lations were determined in all 3 datasets, I-SPY 1, METABRIC, and TCGA,<lb/> as well as in the triple negative (TN) subsets of the 2 larger datasets,<lb/> METABRIC and TCGA. Gene associations were determined using Pearson<lb/> correlations with the Benjamini Hochberg correction for multiple testing<lb/> (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
