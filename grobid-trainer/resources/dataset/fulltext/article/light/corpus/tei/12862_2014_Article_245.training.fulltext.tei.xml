			<p>Hybridisation has long been considered as a process redu-<lb/>cing genetic diversity through introgression <ref type="biblio">[1]</ref>. Thus, the<lb/> effect of hybridisation on species diversification should, if<lb/> anything, be negative due to the potential reduction in fit-<lb/>ness of the hybrids. However views are changing as many<lb/> evolutionary radiations have now documented cases in<lb/> which hybridisation plays a key role in promoting species<lb/> diversification. Common examples of hybridisation indu-<lb/>cing diversification can be found in the Galapagos finches<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[2]</ref>, Hawaiian Lapaula crickets <ref type="biblio">[3]</ref> and Rift Lakes cichlids<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[4,5]</ref>. Building on those evidences and others, Seehausen<lb/> proposed that hybridisation may promote speciation<lb/> and adaptive radiation by generating new genetic and<lb/> phenotypic variation that can be the target of selection<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. With more and more cases of hybrid speciation be-<lb/>ing documented <ref type="biblio">[7]</ref>, the main question is now shifting<lb/> towards understanding how evolutionary radiations are<lb/> facilitated or even catalysed, rather than prevented, by<lb/> hybridisation <ref type="biblio">[8]</ref>.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>During adaptive radiation, available ecological niches<lb/> are filled by the diversifying species <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref>. In the classical<lb/> view, this process occurs through specific phenotypic adap-<lb/>tations that allow the constituent species to take advantage<lb/> of the diversity of ecological niches <ref type="biblio">[10]</ref>. Hybridisation be-<lb/>tween incipient species has been proposed as a mechanism<lb/> that is able to rapidly create new phenotypic combinations<lb/> suitable for further occupancy of untapped niches <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. In-<lb/>deed, transgressive segregation can produce individuals<lb/> with novel phenotypes reaching beyond the possibilities of<lb/> the parental populations <ref type="biblio">[11,12]</ref>. For example, the comple-<lb/>mentary action of genes regulating mineral ion uptake<lb/> allowed hybrids of species of Helianthus sunflowers to sur-<lb/>vive in salt marshes while none of the parent species are<lb/> salt tolerant <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref>. Such an event can create new species<lb/> very rapidly, especially when the newly formed hybrids are<lb/> ecologically distinct from the two parent species <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. For<lb/> instance, as little as 10 to 60 generations are needed for re-<lb/>combination to no longer reduce the size of parental link-<lb/>age blocks in Helianthus, which is a clear sign of genome<lb/> stabilisation in the hybrids <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. This mechanism is never-<lb/>theless dependent on the availability of untapped ecological<lb/> niches. Indeed, the frequency of hybridisation events lead-<lb/>ing to speciation will decrease after the initial burst of<lb/> adaptive radiation because of the saturation of the niche<lb/> space <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. While the theoretical grounds defining the po-<lb/>tential role of hybridisation as an important component of<lb/> species diversification have been laid, empirical evidence is<lb/> needed to better illustrate the effects of this factor during<lb/> adaptive radiations.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>Several methods exist to identify putative hybridisation<lb/> events in evolutionary radiations (reviewed in <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>). Discord-<lb/>ance between phylogenetic trees inferred with either cyto-<lb/>plasmic (chloroplast or mitochondrial) or nuclear DNA can<lb/> suggest the occurrence of hybridisation. This is possible be-<lb/>cause phylogenetic trees based on cytoplasmic information<lb/> will show the evolutionary history of females while nuclear<lb/> DNA will illustrate that of the parental allele that has been<lb/> fixed. Moreover, a tree-based method (the homoplasy ex-<lb/>cess test; HET) has been proposed to identify putative hy-<lb/>brid taxa and likely parental lineages <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. While DNA<lb/> sequences of cytoplasmic or nuclear origin are now readily<lb/> available for a growing number of species, these approaches<lb/> have only been used scarcely (e.g. <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>). Given the potential<lb/> importance of hybridisation for species diversification, there<lb/> is a need to study new cases such as comprehending more<lb/> fully the interactions between hybridisation and speciation.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>In this context, we study hybridisation patterns in the<lb/> clownfishes (or anemonefishes; Pomacentridae), a mono-<lb/>phyletic clade which maintains mutualistic interactions with<lb/> sea anemones <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>. This behaviour is the key innovation<lb/> that promoted the adaptive radiation of clownfishes as spe-<lb/>cies segregated among specific combinations of potential<lb/> host species and habitat, each time matching their pheno-<lb/>type to the environment <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. While this process of eco-<lb/>logical speciation <ref type="biblio">[9]</ref> could alone be responsible for the<lb/> extant diversity of clownfish species, evidence suggests that<lb/> hybridisation may have occurred during the evolution of<lb/> the group. Indeed, a recent phylogenetic tree of the clade<lb/> based on nuclear markers showed several discordant nodes<lb/> with previous phylogenetic trees reconstructed mostly from<lb/> mitochondrial markers <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>. Moreover, interspecific pairs<lb/> have been observed in the wild and two species, Amphi-<lb/>prion leucokranos and A. thiellei, were likely described from<lb/> hybrid material <ref type="biblio">[17,20]</ref>. This indicates a potential history of<lb/> hybridisation in the group. However, whether it impacted<lb/> on the diversification of clownfishes is yet unknown.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>To resolve this issue, we analyse a dataset of mitochon-<lb/>drial and nuclear DNA sequences of clownfish species to<lb/> assess cyto-nuclear discordances and highlight possible<lb/> ancient hybridisation events. Furthermore, we use the<lb/> HET approach to identify species of hybrid origin. Finally,<lb/> we investigate potential hybrids among clownfish individ-<lb/>uals showing hybrid phenotypic characteristics and use<lb/> molecular cloning to assess their status and putatively<lb/> identify the parental species.<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">Results<lb/></head>

			<p>We define from phylogenetic inference eight monophy-<lb/>letic groups of species to facilitate the interpretation of<lb/> our results (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The clade names are based on clas-<lb/>sical clownfish taxonomy that describes 6 species com-<lb/>plexes <ref type="biblio">[21]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Discordance between phylogenetic hypotheses<lb/></head> 
			
			<p>The two consensus phylogenetic trees that we obtain<lb/> show an overall good support with only several recent<lb/> splits showing low posterior probabilities (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).<lb/> Major clades appear in both mitochondrial and nuclear<lb/> phylogenetic trees. Despite the fact that the two datasets<lb/> show well resolved topologies, the relative position of<lb/> the main clades is different between the two analyses<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, see Additional files 1 and 2 for a complete il-<lb/>lustration of node support). The organisation of the per-<lb/>cula clade at the base of the clownfish tree and the<lb/> position of A. latezonatus is congruent between the two<lb/> datasets. However, the Australian group and A. chrysop-<lb/>terus intercalate between the polymnus and Indian<lb/> groups in the nuclear dataset. We identify two mito-<lb/>chondrial lineages in A. sandaracinos with a posterior<lb/> probability of 1, but both samples are clustered in the<lb/> nuclear phylogenetic tree. The ephippium clade, which is<lb/> the sister group of the clarkii clade in the nuclear<lb/></p>

This suggest the exis-<lb/>tence of a hybridisation event at the time of node 8<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Other studies showed that a main upward shift<lb/> in speciation rate occurred at this specific node <ref type="biblio">[22,23]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Hybrid signal<lb/></head>

			<p>We recover an excess of homoplasy at nine nodes of the<lb/> clownfish phylogenetic tree (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Removing either<lb/> A. ocellaris from Bali or A. percula from Papua New<lb/> Guinea increases the BS of Node 41 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), which sug-<lb/>gests genetic exchange between members of the percula<lb/> clade. We find that the &quot; black &quot; specimen of A. clarkii col-<lb/>lected in Bali likely originated from hybridisation between<lb/> other members of the clarkii group (node 37, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).<lb/> We measure further increase of BS at three different<lb/> nodes (6, 16 and 17, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) when individuals of A. chry-<lb/>sopterus from either Moorea or the Solomon Islands are<lb/> removed. Moreover, the BS of node 17 increases when A.<lb/> akindynos is removed, which suggests several hybridisa-<lb/>tion events between A. chrysopterus and species of the<lb/> Australian and polymnus groups occurring around the<lb/> timeframe of node 16 and 17. We also find evidence of<lb/> genetic exchanges between members of the Indian group<lb/> at nodes 20, 22 and 23 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Finally, we identify gene<lb/> exchange between the two A. sandaracinos individuals at<lb/> node 13 and A. pacificus, but the effect on bootstrap<lb/> values is relatively small.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Identification of recent hybrid parental species<lb/></head> 
			
			<p>We infer the phylogenetic trees of mitochondrial (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>)<lb/> and nuclear (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) markers for all sampled clownfish<lb/> species augmented with the additional sequences of the<lb/> supposed hybrid individuals. The cloning procedure<lb/> allowed us to separate the two parental BMP4 sequences<lb/> of each hybrid individual analysed (clones 1 and 2 in<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). As expected, we find that the BMP4 sequences<lb/> from those hybrid individuals that were cloned do not<lb/> cluster by individual species but are separated among par-<lb/>ental clades (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). We deduced the maternal origin of<lb/> the putative hybrids with the mitochondrial phylogenetic<lb/> tree. We find that both hybrids 2 and 3 inherited their<lb/> mitochondrial genes from A. akallopisos. The plastid se-<lb/>quence of hybrid 1 is similar to A. perideraion and A. leu-<lb/>cokranos, as already proposed <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>, derives from A.<lb/> chrysopterus. Moreover, in the mitochondrial tree, A. leu-<lb/>cokranos clusters with A. chrysopterus sampled from the<lb/> Solomon Islands, the origin of A. leucokranos (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>).<lb/> The maternal origin of the four hybrid individuals is highly<lb/> supported in the phylogenetic tree with posterior probabil-<lb/>ities of 1 on the respective ancestral nodes (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The<lb/> nuclear tree confirms those results and each individual<lb/> has one of the cloned sequence that clusters with the same<lb/> species as in the mitochondrial tree (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The pos-<lb/>ition of the other clone provides information on the pater-<lb/>nal origin of the hybrids. A. leucokranos clusters with high<lb/> posterior probability with A. sandaracinos and hybrid 1<lb/> Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> Cytonuclear incongruence.

Colours correspond to species clades (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) as follows: black: outgroups, turquoise: percula, grey: Amphiprion latezonatus and<lb/> A. chrysopterus (monospecific lineages), orange: clarkii, blue: akallopisos, rose: Australian, green: ephippium, yellow: polymnus, brown: Indian.<lb/> A coloured legend, which repeats this information for the major clades, is located at the right of the figure.<lb/> and 3 both cluster with A. perideraion. The other hybrid<lb/> individual (hybrid 3) clusters with any of A. pacificus,<lb/> A. sandaracinos and A. akallopisos, but low posterior<lb/> probabilities forbid any definitive conclusion. Neverthe-<lb/>less, we do not find clear evidence of recombination<lb/> events amongst the cloned sequences, suggesting that<lb/> we sequenced individuals deriving from recent hybri-<lb/>disation events.<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>Our results show instances of cyto-nuclear incongruence<lb/> in the clownfish phylogenetic tree, which suggests several<lb/> hybridisation events. The most ancient of those events oc-<lb/>curred in the same time frame as a node that was identi-<lb/>fied twice independently as the highest increase in<lb/> diversification rate happening in the damselfish family<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[22,23]</ref>. This evidence suggests a relationship between this<lb/> ancient hybridisation event and the main burst of diversifi-<lb/>cation of the adaptive radiation of clownfishes. Moreover,<lb/> we identify nodes with an excess of homoplasy that can be<lb/> attributed to more recent hybridisation events. Finally, we<lb/> identify the parental lineages of four hybrid individuals,<lb/> showing that hybridisation still occurs within clownfishes.<lb/> This evidence suggests that the diversification of the<lb/> clownfishes has been likely fuelled by hybridisation events<lb/> that created novel phenotypes and eventually new species<lb/> in a manner similar to the well-known East African<lb/> cichlids.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Past hybridisation<lb/></head>

			<p>We reconstruct separately the phylogenetic trees of the<lb/> mitochondrial (three markers) and nuclear (seven markers)<lb/> genomes. Most nodes show high posterior probabilities,<lb/> yet, several shallow nodes of our mitochondrial and nuclear<lb/> trees are only weakly supported. This can originate from<lb/> the lack of phylogenetic informative sites between closely<lb/> related species. Previous studies of phylogenetic relation-<lb/>ships of the Pomacentridae inferred by mitochondrial or<lb/> nuclear markers, all support the monophyly of the clown-<lb/>fish as well as the existence of the main clownfish clades<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[18,23-25]</ref>. The topology obtained with the mitochondrial<lb/> data corresponds to these published phylogenetic trees.<lb/> We find several deep cytonuclear discordances in the<lb/> clownfish. The relative position of the ephippium clade<lb/> changes radically between the two datasets, which sug-<lb/>gests the occurrence of hybridisation in the timeframe of<lb/> node 8 (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). While this node is not basal to all<lb/></p>

			<p>clownfishes, it is ancestral to 24 of the 28 species (30 de-<lb/>scribed species minus A. leucokranos and A. thiellei<lb/> which were likely described from hybrid material <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>).<lb/> This clade represents a major shift in diversification rate<lb/> with a 2.5-fold increase compared to the diversification<lb/> rate of Pomacentridae <ref type="biblio">[22,23]</ref>. The pattern of concurrent<lb/> increase in rate of diversification and occurrence of hy-<lb/>bridisation fits into the framework of the syngameon hy-<lb/>pothesis <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>, where hybridisation events preludes an<lb/> acceleration of ecological differentiation and diversification<lb/> rate. Moreover, this result is robust regarding node support,<lb/> as the relationship between the clarkii and the ephippium<lb/> clade is itself highly supported (see Additional file 1).<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>We find paraphyletic mitochondrial genotypes in A.<lb/> sandaracinos. The fact that the two A. sandaracinos in-<lb/>dividuals cluster with high support in the nuclear dataset<lb/> suggests a recent hybridisation event implying a mito-<lb/>chondrial genotype that belongs to an unknown lineage<lb/> of the akallopisos clade. Results of the HET suggest the<lb/> ongoing occurrence of genetic exchanges between A.<lb/> sandaracinos and A. pacificus (node 13, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The<lb/> two species are phenotypically very similar and it is pos-<lb/>sible that a third cryptic species having the mitochon-<lb/>drial profile of the A. sandaracinos sample from Papua<lb/> New Guinea exists. The remaining topological inconsist-<lb/>encies of the polymnus clade are not well supported as<lb/> shown by the Bayesian posterior probabilities of their re-<lb/>spective nodes on the mitochondrial phylogeny. This<lb/> discrepancy may be artifactual and is thus not further<lb/> discussed.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Hybridisation and adaptive radiation<lb/></head>

			<p>Our results highlight the existence of a main hybridisa-<lb/>tion event at the base of the Amphiprion crown group<lb/> (node 8, Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). This node has been previously linked<lb/> with a burst of diversification rate in the clownfish clade<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[22,23]</ref> and may also be mainly responsible for the in-<lb/>crease in rate of morphological evolution found in the<lb/> group <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref>. In contrary, we did not detect traces of an-<lb/>cient hybridisation in the percula group which is species<lb/> poor relative to the Amphiprion crown group. One re-<lb/>cent hybridisation event likely occurred around node 41<lb/> (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) between A. percula and A. ocellaris. The dis-<lb/>tribution of those two species is mostly allopatric, but<lb/> they share a common boundary and may overlap at<lb/> some locations <ref type="biblio">[26]</ref> possibly leading to gene exchange.<lb/> Yet, despite similar behaviour and ecology, the species of<lb/> the percula clade seemingly failed to radiate <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>. The<lb/> fact that the clade deriving from a major hybridisation<lb/> event is the only one to show patterns of rapid speci-<lb/>ation supports the view that hybridisation can promote<lb/> diversification during adaptive radiation. Actually, hy-<lb/>bridisation appears to be one of the key factors explain-<lb/>ing the adaptive radiation of the clownfishes.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Recent hybridisation events<lb/></head>

			<p>We identify the parental species of four putative hybrids,<lb/> one being A. leucokranos, which is currently described<lb/> as a species. Since their taxonomic descriptions, the spe-<lb/>cies status of A. leucokranos and A. thiellei has been<lb/> questioned <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. Indeed, heterospecific pairs have been<lb/> observed in the wild and fish with similar phenotype can be<lb/> produced in aquaria by hybrid crosses <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>. Nevertheless,<lb/> evidence of A. leucokranos pairs also exist <ref type="biblio">[27]</ref>, tentatively<lb/> proposing that we may be witnessing hybrid speciation in<lb/> progress. Yet, demonstrating this ongoing process would<lb/> require more data than available here. It is thus more parsi-<lb/>monious to conclude at the moment, that A. leucokranos is<lb/> an invalid species.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>We separate BMP4 sequences of each parental chromo-<lb/>some through molecular cloning and identify the putative<lb/> parental species of A. leucokranos as A. chrysopterus and<lb/> A. sandaracinos. This is consistent with field observations<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>. The hybrid individuals that we sequenced are all<lb/> likely recent hybrids (possibly F1) because the two clones<lb/> can always be clearly separated and cluster with different<lb/> putative parental taxa. This suggests that genomic re-<lb/>arrangement occurring during reproductive events did not<lb/> yet occur.<lb/></p> 
			
			<p>The special social structure of clownfish may put some<lb/> behavioural constraints on hybridisation. Indeed, all clown-<lb/>fish species are protandrous hermaphrodites and live in so-<lb/>cial groups with size-based dominance hierarchy. The<lb/> female is the largest and dominant individual, the male the<lb/> second largest, and usually smaller non-breeding individ-<lb/>uals follow, decreasing in size relative to their hierarchical<lb/> position <ref type="biblio">[28]</ref>. In certain cases <ref type="biblio">[29-31]</ref>, size differentiation<lb/> allows smaller species to cohabit with a larger species in<lb/> the same anemone. While reproduction of the smallest<lb/> species is largely suppressed by the presence of the largest<lb/> clownfish <ref type="biblio">[32]</ref>, species hybridisation cannot be fully ex-<lb/>cluded. In such instance, the size-based hierarchy ensure<lb/> that the female of a hybrid pair will most probably always<lb/> be the largest individual. This is what we observe in A. leu-<lb/>cokranos. The parental origin of the three other hybrids<lb/> does not allow for a definitive conclusion regarding this be-<lb/>havioural constraint. Indeed, the size difference between<lb/> species of the akallopisos group is small and cannot be<lb/> used as a diagnostic feature separating A. akalloposis, A.<lb/> pacificus and A. perideraion <ref type="biblio">[33]</ref>. It is thus likely that the<lb/> behavioural constraint on hybridisation between those spe-<lb/>cies is going to be weaker than between species with large<lb/> size difference.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Geography of recent hybridisation<lb/></head>

			<p>Hybrid zones appear when two species share such mar-<lb/>gins and have the possibility to exchange genes. At the<lb/> range margins, the probability of encountering a hetero-<lb/>specific mate is higher than that of meeting an individual<lb/> of its own species whenever an individual moves into the<lb/> range of the other species <ref type="biblio">[34]</ref>. This will increase the prob-<lb/>ability of hybridisation events. As expected, A. leucokranos<lb/> is distributed at the edge of the two parental distributions<lb/> and hybrids 1 and 3 were found at the eastern edge of the<lb/> range of A. akallopisos (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Further genetic sam-<lb/>pling would be necessary to better define those potential<lb/> hybrid zones. This would be of particular interest given<lb/> the evolutionary significance of hybridisation in animals,<lb/> as exemplified by the importance of exogenous selection<lb/> on contemporary hybrid zones <ref type="biblio">[35]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<head level="1">Conclusion<lb/></head>

			<p>Hybridisation can impact speciation in many ways. Our<lb/> analyses show that in the case of the adaptive radiation<lb/> of the clownfishes, hybridisation events are linked with a<lb/> burst in diversification rate. We observe that hybridisa-<lb/>tion has occurred throughout the evolutionary history of<lb/> the group and is still happening. Further studies are re-<lb/>quired to measure the extant of ongoing hybrid speciation,<lb/> for example in A. leucokranos. There, field observations<lb/> coupled with experiments will allow to identify the condi-<lb/>tions in which hybrids have a better fitness than their par-<lb/>ents, illustrating the thight relationship linking species<lb/> ecology and evolutionary processes.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Phylogenetic reconstruction<lb/></head>

			<p>We used previously extracted DNA from 41 individuals<lb/> (see <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref> for details; Additional file 3: Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) repre-<lb/>senting 27 species of clownfish to analyse the evolution-<lb/>ary history of mitochondrial genes. We amplified parts<lb/> of the ATP86, CytB and 16S markers via polymerase<lb/> chain reaction (PCR) with a 25 μl reaction mixture con-<lb/>taining ~50 ng of DNA template, 2.5 μL GoTaq buffer,<lb/> 3 μL dNTPs (2.5 μM), 1 MgCl2 (25 μM), 1 μL of both<lb/> forward and reverse primer and 0.3 μL of Taq polymer-<lb/>ase (GoTaq DNA Polymerase, Promega, Madison, WI).<lb/> Primer sequences and PCR cycles were set as in <ref type="biblio">[24]</ref> for<lb/> ATP86 and CytB, and <ref type="biblio">[25]</ref> for the 16S. We purified the<lb/> amplification products with the QIAquick PCR Purifica-<lb/>tion Kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany). We sequenced the<lb/> purified products forward and reverse strands with the<lb/> Big Dye 3.1 Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied<lb/> Biosystems, Foster City, CA), according to the manufac-<lb/>turer&apos;s instructions, and separated the products on an<lb/> ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems,<lb/> Foster City, CA). We assembled a nuclear dataset from<lb/> sequences generated in a previous study <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>; Additional<lb/> file 3: Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). The nuclear dataset is 6,679 base pairs<lb/> long and comports seven genes (BMP4, Glyt, Hox6,<lb/> RAG1, S7, Svep, Zic1). We used MAFFT 6.864b <ref type="biblio">[36]<lb/></ref> with default settings to align each mitochondrial and<lb/> nuclear gene individually. We verified each alignment<lb/> visually and concatenated the mitochondrial and nuclear<lb/> datasets in two separate super-matrices with Sequence-<lb/>Matrix <ref type="biblio">[37]</ref>. We estimated the mitochondrial and nu-<lb/>clear phylogenetic relationships of clownfish species<lb/> with MrBayes 3.2.1 <ref type="biblio">[38]</ref>. The parameters of the nucleo-<lb/>tide substitution process for each gene in the mitochon-<lb/>drial and nuclear data sets were sampled across the GTR<lb/> model space during the Bayesian MCMC <ref type="biblio">[39]</ref>. This ap-<lb/>proach has the advantage of removing the need of a<lb/> priori testing for a specific model of substitution (e.g.<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[40]</ref>). We performed, for each dataset, two independent<lb/> runs of MrBayes with four parallel MCMC chains, each<lb/> 10 million generations long, and sampled model param-<lb/>eters every 1000 generations. We checked for optimal<lb/> parameter convergence using the &apos;sump&apos; command and<lb/> by visualising the trace files and the ESS values of the<lb/> MCMC chains using Tracer v 1.5 <ref type="biblio">[41]</ref>. After the removal<lb/> of 25% of the trees as burn-in, we merged the two inde-<lb/>pendent runs to generate a majority-rule consensus tree<lb/> for both mitochondrial and nuclear dataset that included<lb/> all compatible groups.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Hybrid signal<lb/></head>

			<p>We assessed cytonuclear discordance by comparing visu-<lb/>ally the topology of both consensus phylogenetic trees.<lb/> This step was facilitated by the use of the &quot; cophyloplot &quot;<lb/> function available in the R package Ape <ref type="biblio">[42]</ref>. We further<lb/> applied the framework of the HET on the nuclear data-<lb/>set only <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. Hybrid taxa are intermediate to the parental<lb/> species when considering their nuclear genome, but they<lb/> share identical alleles at each individual locus with only<lb/> one parent <ref type="biblio">[43]</ref>. When included in a phylogenetic tree<lb/> based on a matrix of concatenated nuclear markers, a<lb/> hybrid taxon will introduce an excess of homoplasy due<lb/> to the conflicting phylogenetic signal present in the cor-<lb/>responding gene tree topologies in the clades containing<lb/> the two parental species. Thus, the removal of a putative<lb/> hybrid should reduce conflicts in the phylogenetic tree<lb/> and result in increased support values for the nodes that<lb/> includes the parental species <ref type="biblio">[6]</ref>. While AFLP have ini-<lb/>tially been proposed as input data for the HET, it is con-<lb/>ceptually similar to use the alignments of several nuclear<lb/> genes. The only drawback of using sequence data is a re-<lb/>duction in power due to the lower amount of data and<lb/> less independence between sites. Yet, by increasing the<lb/> number of genes studied, this should not be a major<lb/> issue. We implemented this test in R 3.0.1 <ref type="biblio">[44]</ref> and used<lb/> RAxML 7.3.5 <ref type="biblio">[45]</ref> to perform the phylogenetic inference<lb/> and bootstrap support (BS) using the &apos;GTRGAMMA&apos;<lb/> model of nucleotide substitution and specified a different<lb/> partition for each gene in the dataset. For a species i, we<lb/> first removed it from the complete concatenated align-<lb/>ment of nuclear data. We used this reduced data set<lb/> lacking species i to build a phylogenetic tree and<lb/> estimate node support with 100 bootstrap replicates.<lb/> Second, we generated a null distribution of BS for each<lb/> node of the consensus phylogenetic tree by removing at<lb/> random a species j that is different from the focal species<lb/> i, and inferred, again, the phylogenetic tree and BS. This<lb/> was replicated 100 times. Third, we compared the BS for<lb/> each node obtained by the reduced dataset lacking the<lb/> focal species i to those of the null distribution. We iden-<lb/>tified outlier values of BS when the BS of a node fell<lb/> above the highest value still within 1.5 interquartile<lb/> range of the upper quartile of the null distribution<lb/> <ref type="biblio">[16,46]</ref>. This represent a case where the focal species i is<lb/> of hybrid origin which has the effect of reducing drastic-<lb/>ally the BS of the node ancestral to the parental species.<lb/> Finally, this process was carried on for each taxon in-<lb/>cluded in the phylogeny. At first, we performed this ana-<lb/>lysis using single species removals, but then extended the<lb/> framework to monophyletic pairs, triplets and so on, of<lb/> species (n up to 8) to account for hybrid species which<lb/> may have already further diversified into several descen-<lb/>dants. Each time, we removed n random species from the<lb/> dataset and generated a new null distribution of BS where<lb/> n random species were removed from the alignment.<lb/></p>

			<head level="2">Molecular cloning of recent hybrids<lb/></head>

			<p>We obtained, through an aquarium fish importer, sam-<lb/>ples from three unidentified clownfish specimens that<lb/> displayed hybrid characteristics such as aberrant colour-<lb/>ation or shape. Hybrid 1 and 3 were collected in Bali,<lb/> Indonesia, while hybrid 2 originated from Papua New<lb/> Guinea. We followed the protocol described above to se-<lb/>quence, for each new sample, all three mitochondrial<lb/> markers and the nuclear gene BMP4. We further iso-<lb/>lated from those three individuals and a sample of A.<lb/> leucokranos (a species that may have been described<lb/> form hybrid individuals <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>), putative parental se-<lb/>quences of BMP4 using molecular cloning. We cloned<lb/> the purified PCR products of the BMP4 gene into the<lb/> pTZ57R/T vector using the InsT/Aclone PCR Product<lb/> Cloning Kit (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). Then, we<lb/> amplified up to 12 clones for each individual with the<lb/> M13 forward and reverse primers to ensure that we se-<lb/>quenced all existing variants. We purified and sequenced<lb/> the PCR products as above. We ensured, by checking<lb/> visually all chromatograms, that no sequence showed<lb/> double peaks, which would indicate heterozygous sites<lb/> and thus a failure of the cloning procedure. We assem-<lb/>bled identical clones in Geneious 6 (Biomatters), expect-<lb/>ing to recover two different sequences (one for each<lb/> parent) if the individual is truly a hybrid, or only one if<lb/> it is not the case. We aligned the mitochondrial and nu-<lb/>clear sequences of the hybrid individuals to the two<lb/> super-matrices with MAFFT <ref type="biblio">[36]</ref>. Finally, we expected<lb/> clones to cluster with the sequences of their parental<lb/> species. We identified the putative parents of the indi-<lb/>viduals by reconstructing the phylogenetic trees of both<lb/> super-matrices using MrBayes 3.2.1 in the same manner<lb/> as described above. All newly generated sequences have<lb/> been deposited in the EMBL database (accession num-<lb/>bers in Additional file 3).</p>
