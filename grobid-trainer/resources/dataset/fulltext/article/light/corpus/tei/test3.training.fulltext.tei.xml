			<head>INTRODUCTION<lb/></head>

			<p>Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a complication of<lb/> advanced cancer that carries a poor prognosis and most<lb/> commonly affects patients with breast cancer. <ref type="biblio">1,2</ref> Indeed, in a<lb/> retrospective case series of 103 consecutive unselected patients<lb/> with LC from breast cancer, median overall survival was only<lb/> 3.8 months, less than even the already poor estimates reported<lb/> among selected patients enrolled in prospective randomized<lb/> trials. <ref type="biblio">3</ref> More effective treatments for systemic metastatic<lb/> disease have resulted in patients living longer, at an increased<lb/> risk of LC. <ref type="biblio">4-8</ref> Yet, because of a dramatic paucity of data regarding<lb/> the choice of therapeutic interventions, practice patterns vary<lb/> widely. <ref type="biblio">9</ref> Pre-clinical or early phase I studies in the glioblastoma<lb/> have demonstrated that poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)<lb/> inhibitors penetrate the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting<lb/> a possible role of PARP inhibitors in the treatment of the brain or<lb/> leptomeningeal metastasis. <ref type="biblio">10</ref> Breast cancer patients with heredi-<lb/>tary BRCA1/2 mutations develop CNS metastasis earlier than non-<lb/>carrier patients, even when matched for age, stage, estrogen<lb/> receptor (ER) expression, and human epidermal growth factor<lb/> receptor 2 (HER2) expression, and are in need of effective<lb/> therapies. <ref type="biblio">11</ref> We report a case of a patient with a hereditary BRCA2<lb/> mutation and LC, who demonstrated an excellent clinical and<lb/> radiographic response to olaparib.<lb/></p>

			<head>CASE REPORT<lb/></head>

			<p>A woman with a history of left-sided ductal carcinoma in situ<lb/> diagnosed at age 48 years and who was treated with lumpectomy,<lb/> radiation, and 5 years of tamoxifen presented with anatomic<lb/> distortion in the left nipple 12 years later, at age 62 years. A<lb/> bilateral diagnostic mammogram was initially unremarkable, but a<lb/> mammogram 6 months later showed irregular nodules and<lb/> architectural distortion in the retro-areolar region in the mid<lb/> lower quadrant of the left breast. Further imaging demonstrated a<lb/> 1.5 × 0.8 × 1.1 cm lesion and an ultrasound-guided core biopsy<lb/> showed grade III invasive lobular carcinoma with significant<lb/> perineural invasion. A left-sided skin sparing mastectomy with<lb/> axillary lymph node dissection confirmed extensive grade II/III<lb/> invasive lobular carcinoma measuring 10.4 cm and invading<lb/> skeletal muscle. A 0.3 cm area of fibroadipose tissue in the deep<lb/> surgical margin was positive for invasive carcinoma and metastatic<lb/> carcinoma was present in 21 of 24 lymph nodes. Immunohisto-<lb/>chemistry studies demonstrated 80% ER and 90% progesterone<lb/> receptor positivity; HER2/NEU and E-cadherin were negative. The<lb/> final pathologic American Joint Committee on Cancer (7th edition)<lb/> staging was T3N3a. After the initial negative systemic staging, the<lb/> patient received standard adjuvant chemotherapy with dose-<lb/>dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel<lb/> starting 1 month after surgery, followed by postmastectomy and<lb/> axillary radiation. She started on adjuvant endocrine therapy with<lb/> anastrozole. Commercial genetic testing via Myriad Genetics, Inc.,<lb/> demonstrated a hereditary pathogenic BRCA2 mutation (7558C &gt; T).<lb/> At age 62 years, she underwent risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-<lb/>oophorectomy with pathology showing no evidence of ovarian<lb/> carcinoma.<lb/></p>

			<p>Eleven months after completing adjuvant treatment, the patient<lb/> developed difficulty focusing her eyes, disequilibrium, and mild<lb/> headache. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance<lb/> Status was 1. Ocular motor examination by a neuro-<lb/>ophthalmologist identified a small hypertropia of the right eye<lb/> that increased in the left gaze, downward gaze, and with the right<lb/> head tilt, consistent with a fourth nerve palsy. The remaining<lb/> physical exam was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging<lb/> (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast showed<lb/> enhancement of the bilateral fifth, seventh, and eight cranial<lb/> nerves (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a-d</ref>), <ref type="biblio">12</ref> and spinal MRI with and without contrast<lb/> demonstrated patchy circumferential enhancement of the lower<lb/> thoracic and lumbar spine, and enhancement of the cauda equina<lb/> nerve roots, all consistent with LC. Lumbar puncture demon-<lb/>strated an opening pressure of 24 cm cerebrospinal fluid, white<lb/> blood cell count 2 (normal &lt; 5), and protein 106 mg/dL (normal<lb/> 19-40 mg/dL). Spinal fluid cytology was positive for malignant<lb/> cells, confirming LC. Re-staging computed tomography (CT) scan<lb/> of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of other<lb/> metastatic involvement.<lb/></p>

			<p>Anastrozole was discontinued on confirmation of metastatic<lb/> disease. The patient provided written informed consent to<lb/> participate in a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Review<lb/> Board-approved registry study including publication of this case<lb/> report. Standard treatment approaches to LC were reviewed,<lb/> including radiation therapy (RT) and intrathecal chemotherapy<lb/> (IT-CT). Given her overall excellent performance status and low<lb/> symptom burden, as well as the known limited efficacy and<lb/> significant toxicity of standard approaches, we considered<lb/> additional options. The patient started on olaparib 300 mg twice<lb/> daily with good tolerance. After 4 weeks of olaparib therapy, her<lb/> headaches, disequilibrium, and visual symptoms resolved. Repeat<lb/> lumbar puncture was not performed given the strong correlation<lb/> between clinical symptoms, physical exam, and MRI findings. No<lb/> adverse effects related to olaparib were observed. The first re-<lb/>staging brain MRI performed 4 months after starting olaparib<lb/> demonstrated improved, mild enhancement of the cisternal<lb/> segments of the cranial nerves VII and VIII, and no enhancement<lb/> of the fifth cranial nerves. One year from LC diagnosis and<lb/> initiation of olaparib, brain MRI showed complete resolution of<lb/> previous cranial nerve enhancement (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a, b</ref>). Spinal MRI at that<lb/> time showed resolution of circumferential thoracic and lumbar<lb/> spine enhancement, with only vague enhancement and no<lb/> thickening of the cauda equina nerve roots (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>). Body<lb/> imaging continues to show no evidence of systemic metastatic<lb/> disease. Nineteen months after initiation of olaparib for treatment<lb/> of LC, she continues on the drug and remains asymptomatic with<lb/> imaging showing ongoing response to therapy.<lb/></p>

			<head>DISCUSSION<lb/></head>

			<p>LC is increasingly common, comprising about 11-20% of CNS<lb/> metastasis in breast cancer. <ref type="biblio">13</ref> Prospective studies have found a<lb/> median overall survival of 9-30.3 weeks in patients diagnosed<lb/> with meningeal metastasis. <ref type="biblio">3,14</ref> Hormonal status, HER2 amplifica-<lb/>tion followed by trastuzumab treatment, and good initial<lb/> performance status has been associated with a better prognosis<lb/> in patients with breast cancer LC. In addition, some studies have<lb/> demonstrated that cytologic and clinical response are both<lb/> associated with improvement in survival. <ref type="biblio">15</ref> Data suggest that<lb/> patients with BRCA1/2 mutations and metastatic breast cancer<lb/> develop CNS involvement, and that BRCA2 mutation carriers<lb/> develop CNS metastases at a higher frequency than non-carriers<lb/> when controlling for subtype. <ref type="biblio">16<lb/></ref></p>

			<p>Currently, there is no accepted standard treatment for patients<lb/> with breast cancer who present with LC, and treatment options<lb/> include RT, IT-CT, and systemic chemotherapy. RT may be more<lb/> effective in patients with localized symptoms or bulky disease, and<lb/> the application of focal radiation is preferred over craniospinal<lb/> radiotherapy due to lower toxicity. <ref type="biblio">17</ref> Although IT-CT with<lb/> methotrexate, cytarabine, or thiotepa has been considered the<lb/> mainstay of the treatment for leptomeningeal disease, poor data<lb/> are available to support its routine use. Four small prospective<lb/> trials evaluated IT-CT and difference in the efficacy of these<lb/> agents, and there was a discouraging median survival of<lb/> 9-30 weeks and a significant rate of adverse events. <ref type="biblio">14,18-20</ref> IT<lb/> trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients has demonstrated cytologic<lb/> and radiographic responses in some case series, but its safety and<lb/> efficacy remain under investigation. <ref type="biblio">21<lb/></ref></p> 

			<p>Recently, a shift toward the use of isolated systemic<lb/> chemotherapy has gained strength. A small randomized trial<lb/> comparing systemic or radiation treatment plus IT-CT with non-IT-<lb/>CT treatment demonstrated superior neurological improvement in<lb/> the non-IT-CT patient group and a numerical, but not statistically<lb/> significant survival difference in the non-IT-CT group (18.3 weeks<lb/> vs. 30.3 weeks for non-IT patients; 95% confidence interval (CI)<lb/> -5.5 to +34.3; p = 0.32). <ref type="biblio">18</ref> In addition, patients who received IT-CT<lb/> presented with more neurological complications (47% vs. 6%;<lb/> </p>

			<p><lb/> p = 0.0072). <ref type="biblio">18</ref> Drugs with penetration across a disrupted<lb/> blood-brain barrier (BBB), such as doxorubicin, capecitabine, and<lb/> high-doses methotrexate may provide some clinical benefit.<lb/> Lately, targeted therapies with small molecules, mostly in patients<lb/> with driver gene mutation lung cancer, have been evaluated in<lb/> patients with LC with mixed results. <ref type="biblio">22,23</ref> In this context, PARP<lb/> inhibitors emerge as a possible alternative for the treatment of<lb/> leptomeningeal disease in BRCA carrier patients.<lb/></p>

			<p>Olaparib was the first PARP inhibitor approved by the US Food<lb/> and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic breast<lb/> cancer patients with deleterious germline alterations in BRCA1 or<lb/> BRCA2. Pre-clinical data in animal models initially suggested a lack<lb/> of CNS penetration of olaparib <ref type="biblio">24</ref> and early clinical trials excluded<lb/> women with untreated CNS metastases. <ref type="biblio">24-26</ref> Subsequently, further<lb/> work investigating other PARP inhibitors showed successful brain<lb/> penetration in rodent models with disrupted BBBs due to CNS<lb/> malignancy. <ref type="biblio">27,28</ref> An additional, recently presented study showed<lb/> the limited brain penetration of another PARP inhibitor, rucaparib,<lb/> in murine models with intact BBB. The authors showed that,<lb/> despite this finding, antitumor effect was seen in a BRCA1-mutant<lb/> intracranial murine model. <ref type="biblio">29</ref> These findings collectively suggest a<lb/> potential role for PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated CNS malig-<lb/>nancies, despite apparently limited drug penetration in intact BBB.<lb/> A case study of a patient with BRCA2-mutated metastatic ovarian<lb/> cancer involving the CNS provides clinical support for this<lb/> approach. <ref type="biblio">30<lb/></ref></p> 

			<p>In the randomized phase III Olaparib Monotherapy Versus<lb/> Physicians Choice Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Metastatic<lb/> Breast Cancer Patients With Germline BRCA1/2 Mutations (Olym-<lb/>piAD) study evaluating olaparib vs. treatment of physician&apos;s choice<lb/> in patients with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation,<lb/> patients with treated, stable CNS metastases were eligible. A<lb/> global progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was seen (hazard<lb/> ratio (HR) 0.58; 95% CI 0.43-0.80, p &lt; 0.001), and although this<lb/> benefit was more pronounced in patients with measurable<lb/> disease, no brain metastasis-specific analysis was performed. <ref type="biblio">31</ref> A<lb/> phase I trial evaluating the use of olaparib in combination with<lb/> temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma multiforme was<lb/> presented recently at the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Society for<lb/> Neuro-Oncology in 2017. The authors detected olaparib in 73 of<lb/> 74 tumor core specimens from 27 patients and in 27 of 28 tumor<lb/> margin specimens from 10 patients, indicating safety and drug<lb/> penetration in patients with non-intact BBB. <ref type="biblio">10<lb/></ref> </p>

			<p>A second PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, has been recently<lb/> approved for the treatment of germline BRCA1/2-associated<lb/> metastatic breast cancer after the phase III EMBRACA trial (A<lb/> Study Evaluating Talazoparib, a PARP Inhibitor, in Advanced and/<lb/> or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients with BRCA Mutation)<lb/> compared talazoparib alone with standard chemotherapy in the<lb/> first-fourth line treatment setting. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> A PFS benefit was observed<lb/> (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71, p &lt; 0.001) in the talazoparib arm when<lb/> compared with chemotherapy of provider choice. Notably, 15% of<lb/> patients in the PARP inhibitor arm had stable/treated CNS disease<lb/> at baseline. In a subgroup analysis, these patients also demon-<lb/>strated a PFS benefit compared with chemotherapy, with an HR to<lb/> the left of patients without brain metastasis (HR 0.32, 95% CI<lb/> 0.15-0.68 and HR 0.58, CI 95% 0.43-0.78, respectively), suggesting<lb/> the possibility of a CNS effect of the drug. <ref type="biblio">32</ref> Unfortunately, similar<lb/> to the OlympiAD trial, the EMBRACA trial did not allow patients<lb/> with active parenchymal brain metastases or any history of<lb/> leptomeningeal CNS metastases, and thus is unable to shed<lb/> </p>

Linear enhancement<lb/> adjacent to the right seventh-eighth cranial nerve complex was consistent with a vascular loop. c Sagittal T1-weight MRI of the spine, post<lb/> contrast, shows minimal enhancement anterior to the thoracic spinal cord (arrowhead) and subtle enhancement within the cauda equina<lb/> nerve roots (arrow).<lb/></figure>

			<p>further light on whether PARP inhibitors are active in the CNS,<lb/> with respect to CNS response rates or duration of CNS response.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our patient with leptomeningeal metastasis in the setting of<lb/> BRCA2-mutated breast cancer has maintained a complete clinical<lb/> and a robust radiographic response to olaparib after 19 months of<lb/> therapy. Although she has additional favorable prognostic factors<lb/> such as an ER-positive receptor status, excellent performance<lb/> status, and previously untreated metastatic disease, her response<lb/> suggests efficacy of olaparib and her survival far exceeds reported<lb/> medians for LC in breast cancer. In conclusion, the present case<lb/> supports a potential role for PARP inhibitors in the treatment of LC<lb/> and other CNS metastasis of breast cancer in patients with<lb/> hereditary BRCA mutations. Given the relative paucity of patients<lb/> with LC from BRCA-associated, metastatic breast cancer, a<lb/> randomized trial to test PARP inhibitors vs. IT or other standard<lb/> approaches will not be feasible. We believe that the exclusion of<lb/> patients with active CNS disease from the early phase and<lb/> registration trials of PARP inhibitors represents a missed oppor-<lb/>tunity, and we would encourage investigators to consider<lb/> liberalizing the CNS inclusion criteria for trials testing PARP<lb/> inhibitors in the future. Alternatively, registry or other approaches<lb/> to harness data in the post-marketing setting may allow for a<lb/> greater understanding of the CNS efficacy of PARP inhibitors and<lb/> other novel agents.</p>
