			<p>The experimental discovery of the high-temperature superconducting state in the compressed hydrogen and sul-<lb/>fur systems H 2 S (T C = 150 K for p = 150 GPa) and H 3 S (T C = 203 K for p = 150 GPa) <ref type="biblio">1,2</ref> accounts for carrying out<lb/> investigations, which can potentially lead to the discovery of a material showing the superconducting properties<lb/> at room temperature. For the first time, the possibility of the existence of the superconducting state in hydrogen-<lb/>ated compounds was pointed out by Ashcroft in 2004 <ref type="biblio">3</ref> . It was stated in his second fundamental work concerning<lb/> the high-temperature superconductivity, following his first work written in 1968, in which he propounded the<lb/> existence of the high-temperature superconducting state in metallic hydrogen <ref type="biblio">4</ref> . The superconducting state in<lb/> hydrogenated compounds is induced by the conventional electron-phonon interaction. This fact made possible<lb/> the theoretical description of the superconducting phase in H 2 S and H 3 S even prior to carrying out the suitable<lb/> experiments <ref type="biblio">5,6</ref> . The detailed discussion with respect to the thermodynamic properties of the superconducting<lb/> state occurring in H 2 S and H 3 S one can find in references <ref type="biblio">7-17</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>In 2018, there were held the groundbreaking experiments, which confirmed the existence of the supercon-<lb/>ducting state of extremely high values of the critical temperature in the LaH 10 compound:<lb/> =<lb/> T<lb/> 215<lb/> C<lb/> a<lb/> K for<lb/> p a = 150 GPa and<lb/> =<lb/> T<lb/> 260<lb/> C<lb/> b<lb/> K for p b ∈ (180-200) GPa (and then T<lb/> 250<lb/> C<lb/> c<lb/> K for p c ~ 170 GPa <ref type="biblio">18</ref> ). It was proved<lb/> on the theoretical basis <ref type="biblio">19</ref> that the results achieved by Drozdov et al. <ref type="biblio">20</ref> can be related to the induction of the<lb/> superconducting phase in the R m<lb/> 3 structure (T C = 206-223 K). The experimental results reported by<lb/> Somayazulu et al. <ref type="biblio">21</ref> should be related to the superconducting state induced in the Fm m<lb/> 3 structure, where the<lb/> critical temperature can potentially reach even the value of 280 K. From the materials science perspective, the<lb/> achieved results imply that all possible actions should be taken in order to examine the hydrogen-containing<lb/> materials with respect to the existence of the high-temperature superconducting state at room temperature.<lb/> Attention should be paid to the importance of the discovery of the high-temperature superconducting state in<lb/> LaH 10 because La can form stable hydrogenated compounds with other metals. Such materials can exhibit so<lb/> large hydrogen concentration, that they are presently taken into account as basic components of the hydrogen<lb/> cells intended for vehicle drives <ref type="biblio">22</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>The purpose of this work is, firstly, to present the performed analysis of the thermodynamic properties of<lb/> the superconducting state in the LaH 10 compound. We took advantage of the phenomenological version of the<lb/> Eliashberg equations, for which we fitted the value of the electron-phonon coupling constant on the basis of<lb/> the experimentally found T C value. Our next step consisted in examining the hydrogenated compounds of the<lb/> La δ X 1−δ H 10 -type (LaXH-type) on the basis of the achieved results in order to find a system with an even higher<lb/> value of the critical temperature. Taking into account the structure of the Eliashberg function for hydrogenated<lb/> compounds, with its distinctly separated parts coming from the heavy elements and from hydrogen, we assumed<lb/> X to be Sc or Y, what would, in our opinion, fill the gap in the Eliashberg function occurring within the range<lb/> from about 40 meV to 100 meV. A significant increase in the value of critical temperature should take place as a<lb/> consequence.<lb/></p>

			<head>computational Details, Results and Discussion<lb/></head>

			<p>The thermodynamic parameters of the LaH 10 superconductor were calculated by means of Eliashberg equations<lb/> on the imaginary axis <ref type="biblio">23</ref> :<lb/></p>

			<p>The symbols Δ = Δ Ω<lb/> i<lb/> ( )<lb/> n<lb/> n and =<lb/> Ω<lb/> Z<lb/> Z i<lb/> ( )<lb/> n<lb/> n denote the order parameter and the wave function renormalization<lb/> factor, respectively. The quantity Ω n represents the Matsubara frequency:<lb/> π<lb/> Ω =<lb/> −<lb/> k T n<lb/> ( 2<lb/> 1)<lb/> n<lb/> B<lb/> , where k B is the<lb/> Boltzmann constant. The pairing kernel is defined by:<lb/> λ<lb/> Ω − Ω =<lb/> Ω<lb/> Ω − Ω<lb/> +Ω<lb/> K(<lb/> )<lb/> n<lb/> m<lb/> (<lb/> )<lb/> C<lb/> n<lb/> m<lb/> C<lb/> 2<lb/> 2<lb/> 2 , where λ denotes the elec-<lb/>tron-phonon coupling constant. We determined the value of λ on the basis of experimental data <ref type="biblio">20,21</ref> and the<lb/> condition: Δ<lb/> =<lb/> = =<lb/> [<lb/> ]<lb/> 0<lb/> n<lb/> T T<lb/> 1<lb/> C<lb/> . The fitting between the theory and the experimental results is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. We<lb/> obtained λ a = 2.187 for p a = 150 GPa and λ b = 2.818 for p b = 190 GPa. The symbol Ω C represents the character-<lb/>istic phonon frequency, its value being assumed as Ω C = 100 meV.<lb/></p>

			<p>The repulsion between electrons is modeled by the function: μ<lb/> μ θ<lb/> Ω =<lb/> Ω − Ω<lb/> ( )<lb/> (<lb/> )<lb/> m<lb/> C<lb/> m<lb/> <lb/> <lb/> , where <lb/> μ is the<lb/> Coulomb pseudopotential ( <lb/> μ = 0.1). The quantity Ω C denotes the cut-off frequency (Ω C = 1 eV). The Eliashberg<lb/> equations were solved for the Matsubara frequency equal to 1000. We used numerical methods presented in the<lb/> previous paper <ref type="biblio">24</ref> . In the considered case, we obtained stable equation solutions for T ≥ T 0 = 15 K.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> illustrates the full dependence of the order parameter on temperature. Physical values of the order<lb/> parameter were calculated from the equation: Δ<lb/> =<lb/> Δ Ω = Δ<lb/> T<lb/> T<lb/> ( ) Re[ (<lb/> ( ))], while the function of the order<lb/> parameter on the real axis (Δ Ω<lb/> ( )) was determined using the solutions of the Eliashberg equations on the imagi-<lb/>nary axis and the analytical continuation method described in the reference <ref type="biblio">25</ref> . It can be easily seen that the order<lb/> parameter curves determined within the Eliashberg formalism differ significantly from the curves resulting from<lb/> the BCS theory <ref type="biblio">26,27</ref> . These differences arise from the very high value of the electron-phonon coupling constant of<lb/> the superconductor, what is mirrored by the high value of the dimensionless<lb/> = Δ<lb/> Δ<lb/> R<lb/> T k T<lb/> 2 ( )/ B C<lb/> 0<lb/> ratio, namely<lb/> = .<lb/> Δ<lb/> R<lb/> 4 91<lb/> a<lb/> and<lb/> = .<lb/> Δ<lb/> R<lb/> 5 25<lb/> b<lb/> . Let us recall that within the BCS theory we come to the result:<lb/> = .<lb/> Δ<lb/> R<lb/> [ ]<lb/> 353<lb/> BCS<lb/> , how-<lb/>ever the BCS theory approximates well the experimental results for λ &lt; 0.5.<lb/></p>

			<p>We plotted the temperature dependence of the effective electron mass (m e<lb/>  ) to the band electron mass (m e )<lb/> ratio in the insets in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. The value of the <lb/> m m<lb/> /<lb/> e<lb/> e ratio is given with good approximation by the value of 1 + λ <ref type="biblio">28</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> presents the results achieved for the difference in free energy between the superconducting and the<lb/> normal state (ΔF), the thermodynamic critical field (H C ), and the specific heat in both the superconducting (C S )<lb/> and the normal (C N ) states. The values of the considered quantities were calculated on the basis of formulae given<lb/> in reference <ref type="biblio">28</ref> . In particular, the difference in free energy between the superconducting and the normal state is<lb/> given by:<lb/></p>

			<p>where ρ(0) denotes the value of electronic density of states at Fermi surface; Z n<lb/> S and Z n<lb/> N are the wave function<lb/> normalization factors for the superconducting and the normal state, respectively. Note that ΔF is equal to zero<lb/> exactly for T = T C . This fact results from the overt dependence of free energy on solutions of Eliashberg equations<lb/> (Δ n and Z n ) that have been adjusted to the experimental value of critical temperature by appropriate selection of<lb/> electron-phonon coupling constant (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Thermodynamic critical field should be calculated from the<lb/> formula:<lb/></p>

			<p>Deviations from the results of the BCS theory can be traced in the easiest way by determining the values of<lb/> dimensionless ratios:<lb/> =<lb/> R<lb/> T C T H<lb/> ( )/ (0)<lb/> H<lb/> C<lb/> N<lb/> C<lb/> C<lb/> 2<lb/> and<lb/> = Δ<lb/> R<lb/> C T C T<lb/> ( )/ ( )<lb/> C<lb/> C<lb/> N<lb/> C . For the LaH 10 superconductor, we<lb/> achieved the following results:<lb/> = .<lb/> R<lb/> 0 117<lb/> H<lb/> a<lb/> ,<lb/> = .<lb/> R<lb/> 0 113<lb/> H<lb/> b<lb/> and<lb/> = .<lb/> R<lb/> 3 51<lb/> C<lb/> a<lb/> ,<lb/> = .<lb/> R<lb/> 3 75<lb/> C<lb/> b<lb/> . It is worth noticing that the<lb/> BCS theory predicts<lb/> = .<lb/> R<lb/> [ ]<lb/> 0168<lb/> H BCS<lb/> and<lb/> = .<lb/> R<lb/> [ ]<lb/> 143<lb/> C BCS<lb/> <ref type="biblio">26-29</ref><lb/>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The subsequent last part of the paper discusses the question of induction of the superconducting state in a<lb/> group of compounds of the La δ X 1−δ H 10 -type (or LaXH-type for short). Firstly, we are going to give some criteria,<lb/> which can potentially make easier the search for a material showing the required high-temperature supercon-<lb/>ducting properties. To do this, let us take into account the formula for the critical temperature valid for the BCS<lb/> theory:<lb/> ρ<lb/> = . Ω<lb/> −<lb/> k T<lb/> V<lb/> 1 13<lb/> exp[ 1/ (0) ]<lb/> B C<lb/> max<lb/> , where Ω max denotes the Debye frequency and V stands for the pairing<lb/> potential value. It can be easily noticed that the critical temperature is the higher, the greater are the values of the<lb/> electron density of states at the Fermi surface, the pairing potential, and the maximum phonon frequency.<lb/> Therefore it should be supposed, even at such an early stage of analysis, that special attention is to be paid to these<lb/> hydrogenated compounds, for which the respective non-hydrogenated compounds (La δ X 1−δ ) or hydrides XH<lb/> exhibit the high density of electron states at the Fermi surface. Considerations given to the pairing potential at the<lb/> phenomenological level do not get us very far because this quantity is calculated in a rather complicated way,<lb/> usually employing the DFT (Density Functional Theory) method.<lb/></p>

			<p>Nevertheless, a sensible qualitative analysis can be made with respect to the influence of the atomic mass of the<lb/> X element on a value of the critical temperature (since the mass of the X element determines Ω max ). In this regard,<lb/> let us refer to the theoretical results obtained within the Eliashberg formalism for H 2 S and H 3 S superconduc-<lb/>tors <ref type="biblio">5,6</ref> . They prove that contributions to the Eliashberg function (α Ω<lb/> F( )<lb/> 2<lb/> ) coming from sulphur and from hydro-<lb/>gen are separated due to a huge difference between atomic masses of these two elements. To be precise, the<lb/> electron-phonon interaction derived from sulphur is crucial in the frequency range from 0 meV to Ω max<lb/> S<lb/> equal to<lb/> about 70 meV, while the contribution derived from hydrogen (Ω<lb/> = 220<lb/> max<lb/> H<lb/> meV) is significant above ~100 meV.<lb/> It is noteworthy that we come upon a similar situation in the case of the LaH 10 compound <ref type="biblio">30</ref> . Therefore the follow-<lb/>ing factorization of the Eliashberg function for the LaXH compound can be assumed:<lb/></p>

			<p>where λ La , λ X , and λ H are the contributions to the electron-phonon coupling constant derived from both metals<lb/> (La, X) and hydrogen, respectively. Similarly, the symbols Ω max<lb/> La , Ω max<lb/> X , and Ω max<lb/> H represent the respective maxi-<lb/>mum phonon frequencies. The value of the critical temperature can be assessed from the generalised formula of<lb/> the BCS theory <ref type="biblio">7</ref> :<lb/></p>

			<p>We are going to consider the case Ω<lb/> &lt; Ω<lb/> &lt;<lb/> ~40 meV<lb/> 100 meV<lb/> max<lb/> La<lb/> max<lb/> X<lb/> . It means that we are interested in<lb/> such an X element, the contribution of which to the Eliashberg function fills the gap between contributions com-<lb/>ing from lanthanum and hydrogen. It can be assumed that 0 &lt; λ X &lt; 1, while keeping in mind that λ La = 0.68 <ref type="biblio">31</ref> .<lb/> Additionally, the previous calculations discussed in the work allow to write that λ La + λ H is equal to λ a = 2.187<lb/> for p a = 150 GPa or to λ b = 2.818 for p b = 190 GPa. The quantity <lb/> μ occurring in the Eq. (<ref type="formula">8</ref>) serves now as the<lb/> fitting parameter. One should remember that the formula for the critical temperature given by the Eq. (<ref type="formula">8</ref>) was<lb/> derived with the use of significant simplifying assumptions (the value of the cut-off frequency is neglected, as well<lb/> as the retardation effects modeled by the Matsubara frequency). Therefore the value of the Coulomb pseudopo-<lb/>tential determined from the full Eliashberg equations usually differs from the value of <lb/> μ calculated analytically.<lb/> The experimental data for the LaH 10 superconductor can be reproduced using Eq. (<ref type="formula">8</ref>) and assuming that<lb/> <lb/> μ = .<lb/> 0 170<lb/> a<lb/> and μ = .<lb/> 0 276<lb/> b<lb/> <lb/> .<lb/></p>

			<p>The achieved results are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. It is evident that taking into consideration the additional X ele-<lb/>ment, which enriches the LaH 10 composition, leads to a large increase in the critical temperature value. The esti-<lb/>mated upper limit of the T C<lb/> a value is equal to 288 K for p a = 150 GPa, while for p b = 190 GPa we obtain =<lb/> T<lb/> 315<lb/> C<lb/> b<lb/> K.<lb/> Therefore the superconducting state can potentially exist at room temperature for both cases.<lb/></p>
		
			<p>Now, let us take into account elements with the identical electron configuration at the valence shell as lantha-<lb/>num, but lighter than lanthanum: scandium and yttrium, both being selected as X. Attention should be paid to the<lb/> fact that the electron configuration of X, identical as in lanthanum, should minimize such changes in properties<lb/> of the obtained compound which could result from changes in both the electron dispersion relation and the<lb/> matrix elements of the electron-phonon interaction. Applying the formula: Ω<lb/> Ω<lb/> ~M M<lb/> /<lb/> /<lb/> max<lb/> X<lb/> max<lb/> La<lb/> La<lb/> X we get<lb/> Ω<lb/> ~70<lb/> max<lb/> Sc<lb/> meV and Ω<lb/> ~50<lb/> max<lb/> Y<lb/> meV (M La and M X denote atomic mass of lanthanum and the element X, i.e. Sc or<lb/> Y, respectively).<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> presents the expected range of the critical temperature values for the LaScH and the LaYH com-<lb/>pounds. We took into account two pressure values: p a = 150 GPa and p b = 190 GPa. For LaScH we got:<lb/> ∈<lb/> T<lb/> 220, 267<lb/> C<lb/> a<lb/> K and<lb/> ∈<lb/> T<lb/> 263, 294<lb/> C<lb/> b<lb/> K, while the results for LaYH are as follows:<lb/> ∈<lb/> T<lb/> 218, 247<lb/> C<lb/> a<lb/> K and<lb/> ∈<lb/> T<lb/> 261, 274<lb/> C<lb/> b<lb/> K. Apparently, the significant increase in the critical temperature value should be observed in<lb/> both cases. The effect of growth in the value of the critical temperature results from filling the gap in the Eliashberg<lb/> function between the contributions coming from La and H, as was already stated above.<lb/></p>

			<p>To summarize, the experimental results obtained for the LaH 10 compound get us much closer to the pur-<lb/>pose of obtaining the superconducting state at room temperature. The huge difference between atomic masses<lb/> of lanthanum and hydrogen results in the characteristic structure of the Eliashberg function modeling the<lb/> electron-phonon interaction in the considered compound, with distinctly separated parts proceeded either from<lb/> lanthanum or from hydrogen. The proper selection of the additional element (X) in the LaXH compound is<lb/> expected to fill the &apos; empty&apos; range of the Eliashberg function between the parts coming from La and H. In our opin-<lb/>ion, good candidates are scandium and yttrium. These elements have the electron configuration at the valence<lb/> shell exactly the same as lanthanum, and yet they are considerably lighter. Our numerical calculations suggest the<lb/></p>

(b) is plotted for λ La + λ H = 2.818 and <lb/> μ = .<lb/> 0 276<lb/> b<lb/> . It was assumed that<lb/> Ω<lb/> = 40<lb/> max<lb/> La<lb/> meV and Ω<lb/> = 290<lb/> max<lb/> H<lb/> meV for both cases.<lb/></figure>

			<p>possible growth in the critical temperature of the LaScH compound equal to about 52 K (150 GPa) or to about<lb/> 79 K (190 GPa) as compared to the T C value for the LaH 10 compound. As far as the LaYH compound is con-<lb/>cerned, the pertinent increase in T C value can reach about 32 K for 150 GPa or about 59 K for 190 GPa.<lb/></p>

			<p>Our results can be the starting point for the advanced DFT calculations or perhaps provide inspiration for<lb/> carrying out the appropriate experimental measurements. Of course, we realize that the presented analysis is<lb/> based on the semi-quantitative approximations and may raise some critical remarks. For this reason, we refer to<lb/> the most significant reservations:<lb/></p>

			<p>• In the paper, we assume the relatively simple form of Eliashberg function, which is the linear combination of each<lb/> of the contributions from La, H and X. Does this mean that any contribution related to Sc or Y will be positive?<lb/> Of course, this doesn&apos;t have to be the case. For example, the properly selected concentration of Sc or Y atoms<lb/> can lead to a decrease in the electron-phonon coupling constant. On the other hand, one should remember<lb/> the results obtained for YH 10 compound <ref type="biblio">32,33</ref> . Based on the DFT it was found that the critical temper-<lb/>ature for ∈<lb/> p (250, 300) GPa can exceed the room temperature (<lb/> T<lb/> [ ]<lb/> 320<lb/> C max<lb/> K). This result suggests that a<lb/> high concentration of Y atoms in the LaYH compound should not lead to a decrease in T C . It should also be<lb/> noted that future DFT calculations (or possible experiments) should take into account different concentra-<lb/>tions of Sc and Y atoms.<lb/></p>

			<p>• In the paper, we assume that the phonon frequency regime is completely decoupled (La contributes to low pho-<lb/>non modes and hydrogen vibration should be high). What significance will La-H, Sc-H or Y-H modes which are<lb/> related to the moderate frequency regime? In our opinion, they will contribute to the increase in the critical<lb/> temperature. This will result from activating the Eliashberg function in the frequency range from ~ 40 meV<lb/> to ~100 meV. This effect was clearly visible in the case of YSH 6 and LaSH 6 (p ~ 200 GPa), where the role of<lb/> dopant fulfilled sulphur <ref type="ref">34</ref> .<lb/></p>

			<p>• Do the values of the Coulomb pseudopotential assumed in Eq. (<ref type="formula">8</ref>) ( <lb/> μ = .<lb/> 0 170<lb/> a<lb/> and μ = .<lb/> 0 276<lb/> b<lb/> <lb/> ) roughly corre-<lb/>spond to the physical values of this parameters? In particular, are these values too low, which would lead to the<lb/> significant overestimation of the critical temperature in our paper. In this case, it is worth referring to the<lb/> recently obtained DFT results for LaH 10 . In the publication <ref type="biblio">19</ref> , the authors showed that qualitative compliance<lb/> with experimental data can be obtained assuming <lb/> μ = 0.2 (<lb/> =<lb/> =<lb/> T<lb/> [ ]<lb/> 197<lb/> C p 150GPa<lb/> K for the crystal structure R3<lb/> m, and<lb/> =<lb/> =<lb/> T<lb/> [ ]<lb/> 271<lb/> C p 200GPa<lb/> K for the crystal structure Fm3m). In the first case, the experimental critical tem-<lb/>perature was underestimated by 18 K (too high value of <lb/> μ ), in the second case, T<lb/> [ ]<lb/> C exp was revalued by 11 K<lb/> (too low value of <lb/> μ ). Comparing the results obtained in the paper <ref type="biblio">19</ref> with ours, it is clearly seen that μ a<lb/>  and μ b<lb/> <lb/> are fairly well-obtained. In the most interesting case for LaH 10 corresponds to the pressure of 190 GPa, taking<lb/> into account the possible reduction of μ b<lb/>  suggested in <ref type="biblio">19</ref> , the increase in the critical temperature value for the<lb/> LaScH and LaYH compounds can be expected. It is worth noting that our results also correlate well with the<lb/> data obtained in the paper <ref type="biblio">30</ref> , where <lb/> μ = 0.22 was assumed, which allowed to reproduce the experimental<lb/> critical temperature for LaH 10 (p = 190 GPa).<lb/></p>

			<p>One needs to recognise that the exact quantitative analysis of the problem discussed in our work would<lb/> require to be carried out using the Eliashberg equations including the anharmonicity of the phonon system and<lb/> the non-linear terms of the electron-phonon-phonon interaction, especially for such high values of the critical<lb/> temperature as are observed for LaH 10 . Presently we work upon the derivation of suitable equations.<lb/></p>
