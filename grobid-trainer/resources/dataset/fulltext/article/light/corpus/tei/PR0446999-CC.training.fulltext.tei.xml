			<head>1. Introduction<lb/></head>

			<p>The discovery of superconductivity in Fe-based compounds resulted in a large number of<lb/> experimental and theoretical studies of the materials containing FeAs layers in a structural<lb/> unit <ref type="biblio">[1-5]</ref>. Similar to the cuprates and heavy fermions, superconductivity in iron arsenides<lb/> emerges close to the magnetic instability. There are mainly two classes of Fe-arsenides<lb/> showing superconductivity. RFeAsO crystallizes in the ZrCuSiAs-type structure, composed<lb/> by alternating (RO) and FeAs layers. The other class of compounds belongs to the well known<lb/> ThCr 2 Si 2 -type structure (so called 122 family), AFe 2 As 2 (A: Ba, Sr, Eu or Ca) <ref type="biblio">[6-10]</ref> composed of<lb/> FeAs layers separated by A-layers. Superconductivity in these systems is induced by partial hole<lb/> or electron doping of the FeAs layers, which otherwise order magnetically. Electron doping has<lb/> been highly successful for RFeAsO by substitution of oxygen by fluorine or by oxide vacancies,<lb/> whereas K or Na doping is more successful for AFe 2 As 2 compounds.<lb/></p>

			<p>EuFe 2 As 2 belongs to the so-called 122 family. We have recently performed systematic physical<lb/> property measurements on EuFe 2 As 2 single crystals and Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 polycrystals <ref type="biblio">[9,11]</ref>. A<lb/> very similar magnetic transition related to Fe 2 As 2 layers was revealed in EuFe 2 As 2 and other<lb/> AFe 2 As 2 systems. EuFe 2 As 2 undergoes a SDW magnetic transition at 190 K due to Fe ordering,<lb/> accompanied by a structural transition <ref type="biblio">[12]</ref>. Furthermore it also shows a second magnetic<lb/> ordering at 19 K due to Eu 2+ spin ordering. By doping Potassium to the Eu lattice (hole<lb/> doping), Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 shows the suppression of the SDW transition and the appearance<lb/> of a SC phase transition at 32 K. We have also measured the magnetic penetration depth<lb/> λ(T ) for polycrystalline samples of Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 , which shows deviations from conventional<lb/> behavior. A minimum in the penetration depth vs temperature at 4.2 K suggests a strong<lb/> influence of the Eu magnetic ordering <ref type="biblio">[13]</ref> on the supercondusting properties. Additionally,<lb/> our recent Mössbauer spectroscopy measurements clearly establish the coexistence of Eu short-<lb/>range magnetic order with superconductivity in Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 samples below 4.5 K <ref type="biblio">[14]</ref>. The<lb/> application of pressure on EuFe 2 As 2 , results in a continuous suppression of the SDW ordering<lb/> above 2 GPa and a sharp drop in the electrical resistivity, ρ(T), which indicates the onset of<lb/> superconductivity at T c 29 K <ref type="biblio">[15]</ref>. Interestingly, upon further cooling, the resistivity increases<lb/> at the Eu ordering temperature, which is nearly pressure independent. Below, we report a<lb/> detailed study on various concentrations of K doping with particular focus on temperature-<lb/>dependent specific heat measurements through the SC transition.<lb/></p> 

			<p>Single crystals of EuFe 2 As 2 were grown using the Sn-flux method <ref type="biblio">[16]</ref>. The polycrystalline K-<lb/>doped samples were prepared using solid-state reaction; more details on the sample preparation<lb/> has previously been reported <ref type="biblio">[11]</ref>. Electrical resistivity and specific heat were measured using<lb/> a Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design, USA), while for the dc<lb/> magnetic susceptibility a Quantum Design MPMS system has been utilized.<lb/></p>

			<p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility of EuFe 2 As 2 single<lb/> crystals in two orientations of the applied magnetic field. At high temperatures (T &gt; 40 K), there<lb/> is no difference between χ ab and χ c , indicating an isotropic susceptibility. In the range of 19 K to<lb/> 40 K, however, a significant anisotropy in the susceptibility is found (e.g. χ ab /χ c = 1.6 at 19 K),<lb/> suggesting an anisotropic magnetic interaction between Eu spins. At 19 K, a clear drop in χ ab and<lb/> χ c indicates the AFM transition. The high-temperature data(above 200K)follow a Curie-Weiss<lb/> law (cf. lower inset of figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) and can be best fitted with an additional temperature independent<lb/> susceptibility χ 0 . The so-derived effective magnetic moment for both H c and H ⊥ c is close<lb/> to the theoretical value for Eu 2+ (7.94µ B ). The Weiss temperature is positive, indicating a<lb/> predominately ferromagnetic interaction between the Eu 2+ spins at high temperatures. The<lb/> Eu 2+ spins probably align ferromagnetically within the ab planes, but antiferromagnetically<lb/> along the c-axis, this is recently confirmed by neutron measurements <ref type="biblio">[17]</ref>. The lower inset shows<lb/> the inverse magnetic susceptibility in the temperature range between 185 and 195 K. A small<lb/></p>

The lower inset displays C p /T vs T , which clearly<lb/> shows an anomaly at the SC transition. The upper inset displays the jump height at the SC<lb/> transition after subtracting a phonon contribution derived from the Sr compound.<lb/></figure>

			<p>change in slope in 1/χ at 190 K could be found for both field orientations (lower inset Fig.<ref type="figure">1</ref>),<lb/> which is small compared to Ba and Sr 122 compounds due to the strong Eu 2+ contribution to<lb/> the susceptibility. This anomaly in 1/χ has been identified to be due to the AFM spin density<lb/> wave (SDW) transition combined with the structural transition. S. Jiang et al. <ref type="biblio">[18]</ref> observed<lb/> such a SDW transition only after subtraction of the Curie-Weiss contribution of Eu 2+ moments.<lb/></p>

			<p>In Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, we present the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for<lb/> Eu 1-x K x Fe 2 As 2 samples with x = 0.35, 0.45 and 0.5 respectively. By doping K, we found<lb/> that the maximum SC transition appears in the sample with nominal composition of x = 0.45.<lb/> In the sample of x = 0.35 and 0.5, the resistivity drop shifts to lower temperatures. The<lb/> electrical resistivity data exhibit a linear behavior above T c . The inset shows the magnetic field<lb/> dependence of the resistivity for Eu 0.55 K 0.45 Fe 2 As 2 . The small shift of the T c suggests that the<lb/> SC transition is quite robust against magnetic fields. It has to be noted, that the upper critical<lb/> fields in these materials are rather high, i.e. of the order of 50 to 60 T <ref type="biblio">[19]</ref>, in accordance with<lb/> recently preformed high-field resistivity measurements on Eu 0.5 K 0.5 Fe 2 As 2 <ref type="biblio">[20]</ref>.<lb/></p>

			<p>The temperature dependent specific heat for x= 0, 0.45 and 0.5 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The broad<lb/> anomaly at the SC transition ( 32K) arises possibly due to the non-uniform distribution of the<lb/> dopant concentration. Due to a large phonon contribution at the superconductivity transition<lb/> a reliable estimation of the normal-state electronic specific heat is difficult. Additionally, there<lb/> is a magnetic contribution from Eu 2+ moments, which could not easily be subtracted from the<lb/> measured data. For this reason we are limited in the experimental determination of ∆C p /T c .<lb/> There is a clear anomaly at the SC transition for x= 0.45 and 0.5, which confirms the bulk<lb/> nature of the phase transition; the AFM ordering of Eu spins is suppressed after K doping. The<lb/> SC anomaly is clearer in C p /T vs T (lower inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) and a small increase in the electronic<lb/> specific heat below 10 K is due to the Eu spins. Furthermore, we have subtracted the phonon<lb/> contribution, derived from the SrFe 2 As 2 specific heat (yielding the specific heat increment δC<lb/> shown in the upper inset of Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), which gives a rough estimation of the electronic specific<lb/> heat of Eu 0.55 K 0.45 Fe 2 As 2 . Due to the substantial width of the SC transition, ∆C p /T c and T c<lb/> values were determined from this δC/T vs T plot. The estimated jump ∆C p /T c is approximately<lb/> 70 mJ/mol K 2 , resulting in a ratio ∆C/(γT c ) which is substantially larger than the BCS value<lb/> of 1.43, hinting at a strong-coupling scenario.<lb/></p>

			<p>To summarize, the magnetic susceptibility of EuFe 2 As 2 single crystals shows two AFM<lb/> transitions, related to the FeAs and Eu sublattices. The resistivity for various K dopings shows<lb/> the SC transition with a linear temperature dependence above T c . The temperature dependent<lb/> specific heat displays a clear anomaly at the SC transition with a large jump height of almost<lb/> 70 mJ/mol K 2 .<lb/></p>
