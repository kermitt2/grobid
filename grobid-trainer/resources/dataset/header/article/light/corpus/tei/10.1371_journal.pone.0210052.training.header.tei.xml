	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Needles are commonly used in the clinic for percutaneous procedures. The outcome of<lb/> such procedures heavily depends on accurate placement of the needle. There are two<lb/> main challenges to achieve high accuracy: First, aligning the needle with the targeted lesion,<lb/> and second, compensating for the deflection of the needle in the tissue. In order to address<lb/> these challenges, scientists have developed several robotic setups for needle steering.<lb/> However, the subject is still under research and reliable implementations which can be used<lb/> in clinical practice are not yet available. In this paper, we have taken some steps in order to<lb/> bring needle steering closer to practice. A new hybrid control algorithm is developed, which<lb/> enables us to control a flexible needle by combing base-manipulation and beveled-tip steer-<lb/>ing methods. A pre-operative path planner is developed which considers the clinical require-<lb/>ments. The proposed method is tested in the lung of a fresh-frozen human cadaver. The<lb/> work-flow of the experiments are similar to the current clinical practice. Three experimental<lb/> cases are used to evaluate the proposed steering algorithm. Experimental Case I shows<lb/> that using the proposed steering algorithm controllability of the needle is increased. In Case<lb/> II and Case III, the needle is steered in a gelatin phantom and a human cadaver, respec-<lb/>tively. The targeting accuracy of 1.35±0.49mm in gelatin phantom and 1.97±0.89mm in<lb/> cadave is achieved. A feasibility study is performed, in which a fine needle aspiration (FNA)<lb/> needle is steered in the lungs of a human cadaver under computed tomography guidance.<lb/> The targeting error for the feasibility study is 2.89±0.22mm. The results suggest that such a<lb/> robotic system can be beneficial for clinical use and the patient receives less x-ray radiation.<lb/></div>
