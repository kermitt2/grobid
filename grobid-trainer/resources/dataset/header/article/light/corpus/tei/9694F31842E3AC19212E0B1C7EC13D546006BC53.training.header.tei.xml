	ABSTRACT:
	<div type="abstract">Homeless women are very different from homeless men, but few studies<lb/> have reported data separately on them or compared them directly with men. This report<lb/> on a study of 600 homeless men and 300 homeless women in St. Louis presents<lb/> comparison data on these populations. The pivotal difference between homeless men<lb/> and women was that unlike men, most women had young children in their custody. The<lb/> women were also younger than men, more likely to be members of a minority group,<lb/> and more often dependent on welfare. They had been homeless for a shorter period and<lb/> spent less time in unsheltered locations. Compared to men, they had less frequent<lb/> histories of substance abuse, incarceration, and felony conviction. Solitary women<lb/> (without children with them), compared to women with children in their custody, were<lb/> more likely to be white, had been homeless longer, and more often had a history of<lb/> alcoholism or schizophrenia. On most variables, values for solitary women lay some-<lb/>where between those for men and for women with children. The population of homeless<lb/> women is therefore heterogeneous, with at least two subgroups. These groups are likely<lb/> to benefit from intervention programs that are designed to address their specific<lb/> problems and needs, which are not necessarily the same as those of homeless men.<lb/></div>
