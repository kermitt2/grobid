	<div type="abstract">In order to identify new genes with differential expression in early intestinal tumours, we performed mRNA<lb/> (messenger ribonucleic acid) expression profiling of 16 human and 63 mouse adenomas. All individuals<lb/> had germline APC mutations to ensure that tumorigenesis was driven by &apos;second hits&apos; at APC. Using strin-<lb/>gent filtering to identify changes consistent between humans and mice, we identified 60 genes up-regulated<lb/> and 151 down-regulated in tumours. For 22 selected genes-including known Wnt targets-expression differ-<lb/>ences were confirmed by qRT -PCR (quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). Most, but<lb/> not all, differences were also present in colorectal carcinomas. In situ analysis showed a complex picture.<lb/> Expression of up-regulated genes in adenomas was usually uniform/diffuse (e.g. ITGA6) or prominent in<lb/> the tumour core (e.g. LGR5); in normal tissue, these genes were expressed at crypt bases or the transit ampli-<lb/>fying zone. Down-regulated genes were often undetectable in adenomas, but in normal tissue were expressed<lb/> in mesenchyme (e.g. GREM1/2) or differentiated cells towards crypt tops (e.g. SGK1). In silico analysis of<lb/> TCF4-binding motifs showed that some of our genes were probably direct Wnt targets. Previous studies,<lb/> mostly focused on human tumours, showed partial overlap with our &apos;expression signature&apos;, but 37 genes<lb/> were unique to our study, including TACSTD2, SEMA3F, HOXA9 and IER3 (up-regulated), and TAGLN,<lb/> GREM1, GREM2, MAB21L2 and RARRES2 (down-regulated). Combined analysis of our and published<lb/> human data identified additional genes differentially expressed in adenomas, including decreased BMPs<lb/> (bone morphogenetic proteins) and increased BUB1/BUB1B. Several of the newly identified, differentially<lb/> expressed genes represent potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets for intestinal tumours.</div>
