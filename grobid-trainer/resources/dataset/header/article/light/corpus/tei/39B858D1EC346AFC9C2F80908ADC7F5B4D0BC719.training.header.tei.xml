	ABSTRACT:
	<div type="abstract">The hardships of war affect all members of society. Those most acutely<lb/> affected are service members and their families. Civilian service personnel mobilized<lb/> within an active reserve component experience a disruption of life style which can<lb/> cause stress. Service members are trained to be effective soldiers, but very little<lb/> training is provided to service members or their families on the wartime stresses they<lb/> face. The psychiatric army reserve unit based in Minneapolis developed a family<lb/> support program for three phases of wartime stress: (1) pre-deployment, (2) deployment,<lb/> and (3) reunification and sustainment. Recommendations are provided for family sup-<lb/>port in future wartime situations.<lb/> </div>
