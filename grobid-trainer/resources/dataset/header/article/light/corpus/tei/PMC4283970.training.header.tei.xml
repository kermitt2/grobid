	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Dental therapy is an accepted component of the dental profession in the Alaska<lb/> Native Tribal Health Consortium and in the state of Minnesota. There are also<lb/> several states working to enact legislation to permit the practice of dental therapy.<lb/> However, in the absence of nationally recognized educational standards, concerns<lb/> have been raised relating to the lack of uniformity in dental therapy education. In<lb/> 2010, a panel of academicians met and prepared a report on the principles, com-<lb/>petencies, and curriculum for educating dental therapists. Still, there remained<lb/> questions in regard to what the minimal educational standards should be for<lb/> institutions that wish to sponsor dental therapy programs. A second panel was<lb/> convened to address education standards. This paper describes the Panel&apos;s delib-<lb/>erations on three critical issues in developing the report: the length of the program<lb/> and degree to be awarded; credentials of the program director; and the nature of<lb/> supervision.<lb/></div>
