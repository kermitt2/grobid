	<div type="abstract">Copy-number variants (CNVs) are a source of genetic variation that increasingly are associated with human<lb/> disease. However, the role of CNVs in human lifespan is to date unknown. To identify CNVs that influence<lb/> mortality at old age, we analyzed genome-wide CNV data in 5178 participants of Rotterdam Study (RS1)<lb/> and positive findings were evaluated in 1714 participants of the second cohort of the Rotterdam Study<lb/> (RS2) and in 4550 participants of Framingham Heart Study (FHS). First, we assessed the total burden of<lb/> rare (frequency &lt;1%) and common (frequency &gt;1%) CNVs for association with mortality during follow-up.<lb/> These analyses were repeated by stratifying CNVs by type and size. Secondly, we assessed individual<lb/> common CNV regions (CNVR) for association with mortality. We observed that the burden of common but<lb/> not of rare CNVs influences mortality. A higher burden of large (≥500 kb) common deletions associated<lb/> with 4% higher mortality [hazard ratio (HR) per CNV 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 -1.07, P 5<lb/> 5.82 3 10 25 ] in the 11 442 participants of RS1, RS2 and FHS. In the analysis of 312 individual common<lb/> CNVRs, we identified two regions (11p15.5; 14q21.3) that associated with higher mortality in these cohorts.<lb/> The 11p15.5 region (combined HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.31 -1.93, P 5 2.87 3 10 26 ) encompasses 41 genes, of<lb/> which some have previously been related to longevity, whereas the 14q21.3 region (combined HR 1.57,<lb/> 95% CI 1.19 -2.07, P 5 1.53 3 10 23 ) does not encompass any genes. In conclusion, the burden of large<lb/> common deletions, as well as common CNVs in 11p15.5 and 14q21.3 region, associate with higher mortality.</div>
