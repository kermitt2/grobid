	<div type="abstract">In this article we focus on human-human multi-tasking dialogues, in which pairs of con-<lb/>versants, using speech, work on an ongoing task while occasionally completing real-time tasks.<lb/> The ongoing task is a poker game in which conversants need to assemble a poker hand, and the<lb/> real-time task is a picture game in which conversants need to find out whether they have a certain<lb/> picture on their displays. We employ empirical corpus studies and machine learning experiments<lb/> to understand the mechanisms that people use in managing these complex interactions. First,<lb/> we examine task interruptions: switching from the ongoing task to a real-time task. We find<lb/> that generally conversants tend to interrupt at a less disruptive context in the ongoing task<lb/> when possible. We also find that the discourse markers oh and wait occur in initiating a task<lb/> interruption twice as often as in the conversation of the ongoing task. Pitch is also found to be<lb/> statistically correlated with task interruptions; in fact, the more disruptive the task interruption,<lb/> the higher the pitch. Second, we examine task resumptions: returning to the ongoing task after<lb/> completing an interrupting real-time task. We find that conversants might simply resume the<lb/> conversation where they left off, but sometimes they repeat the last utterance or summarize the<lb/> critical information that was exchanged before the interruption. Third, we apply machine learn-<lb/>ing to determine how well task interruptions can be recognized automatically and to investigate<lb/> the usefulness of the cues that we find in the corpus studies. We find that discourse context, pitch,<lb/> and the discourse markers oh and wait are important features to reliably recognize task interrup-<lb/>tions; and with non-lexical features one can improve the performance of recognizing task inter-<lb/>ruptions with more than a 50% relative error reduction over a baseline. Finally, we discuss the<lb/> implication of our findings for building a speech interface that supports multi-tasking dialogue.<lb/></div>
