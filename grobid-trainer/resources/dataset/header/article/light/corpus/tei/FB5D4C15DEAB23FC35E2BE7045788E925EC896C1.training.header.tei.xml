	<div type="abstract">Re-<lb/>ceptive vocabulary of Hispanic children in Miami was tested in both English and Spanish with<lb/> complementary standardized tests, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-H) and the Test<lb/> de Vocabulario en Imagenes Peabody (TVIP-H), 105 bilingual flrst graders, of middle to high<lb/> socioeconomic status relative to national norms, were divided according to the language(s) spo-<lb/>ken in their homes. Both groups, whether they spoke only Spanish in the home (OSH) or both<lb/> English and Spanish in the home (ESH), performed near the mean of 100 in Spanish receptive<lb/> vocabulary (TVIP-H means 97,0 and 96.5); in contrast, ESH group children scored more than 1<lb/> SD higher in EngUsh than OSH group children (PPVT-R means 88.0 and 69,7, respectively). It<lb/> appears, therefore, that learning 2 languages at once does not harm receptive language develop-<lb/>ment in the language of origin, while it does lay the groundwork for superior performance in the<lb/> majority language. Furthermore, an analysis of translation equivalents, items shared by both<lb/> tests, shows that a statistically signiflcant portion of bilingual children&apos;s lexical knowledge does<lb/> not overlap in their 2 languages and is therefore not reflected in single-language scores.<lb/></div>
