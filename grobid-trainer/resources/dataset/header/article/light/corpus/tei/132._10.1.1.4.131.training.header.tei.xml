	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Integrating persistence into an existing programming language is a serious undertaking. Pre-<lb/>serving the essence of the existing language, adequately supporting persistence, and main-<lb/>taining e ciency require low-level support from the compiler and runtime systems. Pervasive,<lb/> low-level changes were made to a Lisp compiler and runtime system to introduce persistence.<lb/> The result is an e cient language which i s w orthy of the name Persistent Lisp. 1<lb/> </div>
