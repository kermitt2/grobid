	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Assessment of ERBB2 (HER2) status in breast<lb/> carcinomas has become critical in determining response<lb/> to the humanised monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. The<lb/> current joint College of American Pathologists and the<lb/> American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for the<lb/> evaluation of HER2 status in breast carcinoma involve<lb/> testing by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ<lb/> hybridisation (FISH). However, neither of these modalities<lb/> is without limitations. Novel bright field in situ<lb/> hybridisation techniques continue to provide viable<lb/> alternatives to FISH testing. While these techniques are<lb/> not limited to evaluation of the HER2 gene, the extensive<lb/> number of studies comparing bright field in situ<lb/> techniques with other methods of assessing HER2 status<lb/> allow a robust evaluation of this approach. Analysis of the<lb/> literature demonstrates that, when used to assess HER2<lb/> gene status, bright field in situ hybridisation demonstrates<lb/> excellent concordance with FISH results. The average<lb/> percentage agreement in an informal analysis of studies<lb/> comparing HER2 amplification by chromogenic in situ<lb/> hybridisation with FISH was 96% (SD 4%); k coefficients<lb/> ranged from 0.76 to 1.0. Although a much smaller<lb/> number of studies are available for review, similar levels<lb/> of concordance have been reported in studies comparing<lb/> HER2 amplification by methods employing metallography<lb/> (silver in situ hybridisation) with FISH. A summary of the<lb/> advancements in bright field in situ hybridisation, with<lb/> focus on those techniques with clinical applications of<lb/> interest to the practicing pathologist, is presented.<lb/></div>
