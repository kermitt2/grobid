	<div type="abstract">The aim of this study is to understand the perceptions of Brazilian citizens about the actual conditions<lb/> of farm animal welfare in the poultry, beef, and dairy supply chains. To reach this aim, an online<lb/> survey was conducted. The analysis was based on descriptive statistics and three logistic regressions<lb/> models. Results of descriptive statistics showed that citizens in Brazil had mostly negative perceptions<lb/> about the actual conditions of animal welfare in the poultry, beef, and dairy supply chains. Results of<lb/> the logistic regression models showed that in the poultry and dairy supply chains, citizens with<lb/> background in agricultural/veterinary sciences, and citizens who reported a higher level of knowledge<lb/> about these supply chains, were more likely to perceive as bad the actual conditions of farm animal<lb/> welfare. In the poultry supply chain, citizens who reported previous contact with poultry farms were<lb/> also more likely to perceive as bad the actual condition of farm animal welfare. In addition, the<lb/> perception that farmers are mainly focused on the economic aspect of farming and less on animal<lb/> welfare, the perception that animals do not have a good quality of life while housed on farms, and the<lb/> perception that animals are not adequately transported and slaughtered, negatively impact on<lb/> perceptions about the actual conditions of farm animal welfare in the three supply chains. We<lb/> concluded that a protocol aimed to improve citizens&apos; perceptions about the actual conditions of farm<lb/> animal welfare should focus in all phases of the supply chains.</div>
