	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The study had the goal to study the relationship between resilience, stress and injuries in<lb/> the sport context. Eight female athletes, part of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Brazilian Team<lb/> along the Olympic Cycle 2015-2016 participated in the study, with a mean age of 20.4±2.5<lb/> years. The following instruments were used: RESTQ-76 Sport, CD-RISC 10, documental<lb/> analysis of physical therapy records, and structured questionnaire. Data was analyzed by<lb/> descriptive statistics (frequency, mean and standard deviation); Repeated Measured<lb/> ANOVA with Bonferroni&apos;s post-hoc, Student&apos;s &quot;t&quot; test, Friedman test, Pearson Correlation<lb/> Coefficient, Cohen&apos;s d, and inductive thematic analysis. We found relatively stable levels of<lb/> stress and recovery across the season; total recovery levels were higher than stress at all<lb/> four measured timepoints (p&lt;0.05); All athletes had at least one injury, with a total of 14 inju-<lb/>ries; No significant correlations were found between the quantitative scores of resilience,<lb/> stress and recovery; Training and the sport&apos;s scoring system were the most relevant per-<lb/>ceived stressors; athletes presented meta-cognition and a non-positive evaluation (neutral)<lb/> of stressors; Social support was considered the main psychological factor for the resilience<lb/> process; such process resulted in improved control and interpretation of emotions; Our<lb/> hypothesized model proposes that, in the relationship between stress and injuries, resil-<lb/>ience acts by optimizing the injury recovery process. It was concluded that resilience plays a<lb/> role in the process of injury rehabilitation and stress control in elite rhythmic gymnastics&apos;<lb/> athletes.<lb/></div>
