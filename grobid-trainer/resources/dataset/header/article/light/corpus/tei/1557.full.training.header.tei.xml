	<div type="abstract">† Background A basic theme in the study of plant -pollinator interactions is that pollinators select not just for<lb/> single floral traits, but for associations of traits. Responses of pollinators to sets of traits are inherent in the<lb/> idea of pollinator syndromes. In its most extreme form, selection on a suite of traits can take the form of correla-<lb/>tional selection, in which a response to one trait depends on the value of another, thereby favouring floral inte-<lb/>gration. Despite the importance of selection for combinations of traits in the evolution of flowers, evidence is<lb/> relatively sparse and relies mostly on observational approaches.<lb/> † Scope Here, methods for measuring selection on multivariate suites of floral traits are presented, and the studies<lb/> to date are reviewed. It is argued that phenotypic manipulations present a powerful, but rarely used, approach to<lb/> teasing apart the separate and combined effects of particular traits. The approach is illustrated with data from<lb/> studies of alpine plants in Colorado and New Zealand, and recommendations are made about several features<lb/> of the design of such experiments.<lb/> † Conclusions Phenotypic manipulations of two or more traits in combination provide a direct way of testing for<lb/> selection of floral trait associations. Such experiments will be particularly valuable if rooted in hypotheses about<lb/> differences between types of pollinators and tied to a proposed evolutionary history.<lb/></div>
