	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">While screening a large collection of wild and laboratory yeast isolates for their<lb/> ability to attract Drosophila melanogaster adults, we noticed a large difference in fly<lb/> preference for two nearly isogenic strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, BY4741 and<lb/> BY4742. Using standard genetic analyses, we tracked the preference difference to<lb/> the lack of functional mitochondria the stock of BY4742 used in the initial<lb/> experiment. We used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy to<lb/> examine the volatile compounds produced by BY4741 and the mitochondria--<lb/>deficient BY4742, and found they differed significantly. We found that several ethyl<lb/> esters are present at much higher levels in strains with functional mitochondria,<lb/> even in fermentative conditions. We confirmed the role of these ethyl esters in<lb/> attraction by examining an EEB1Î” strain which reduces ethyl ester production. We<lb/> found that nitrogen levels in the substrate affect the production of these<lb/> compounds, and that they are produced at high levels by strains with functional<lb/> mitochondria in the fermentation of natural substrates. Collectively these<lb/> observations demonstrate the effect core metabolic processes have in mediating the<lb/> interaction between yeasts and insect vectors, and highlight the importance of non--<lb/>respirative mitochondrial functions in yeast ecology.<lb/></div>
