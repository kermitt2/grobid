	<div type="abstract">Background: Cadmium (Cd), a food-chain contaminant, is a significant health hazard. The<lb/> kidney is one of the primary sites of injury after chronic Cd exposure. Kidney-based risk assessment<lb/> establishes the urinary Cd threshold at 5.24 μg/g creatinine, and tolerable dietary intake of Cd at<lb/> 62 μg/day per 70-kg person. However, cohort studies show that dietary Cd intake below a threshold<lb/> limit and that tolerable levels may increase the risk of death from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and<lb/> Alzheimer&apos;s disease.<lb/> oBjective: We evaluated if the current tolerable dietary Cd intake guideline and urinary Cd<lb/> threshold limit provide sufficient health protection.<lb/> discussion: Staple foods constitute 40-60% of total dietary Cd intake by average consumers. Diets<lb/> high in shellfish, crustaceans, mollusks, spinach, and offal add to dietary Cd sources. Modeling<lb/> studies predict the current tolerable dietary intake corresponding to urinary Cd of 0.70-1.85 μg/g<lb/> creatinine in men and 0.95-3.07 μg/g creatinine in women. Urinary Cd levels of &lt; 1 μg/g creatinine<lb/> were associated with progressive kidney dysfunction and peripheral vascular disease. A urinary Cd<lb/> of 0.37 μg/g creatinine was associated with breast cancer, whereas dietary Cd of 16-31.5 μg/day<lb/> was associated with 25-94% increase in risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.<lb/> conclusion: Modeling shows that dietary intake levels for Cd exceed the levels associated with<lb/> kidney damage and many other adverse outcomes. Thus, the threshold level of urinary Cd should<lb/> be re-evaluated. A more restrictive dietary intake guideline would afford enhanced health protection<lb/> from this pervasive toxic metal.<lb/></div>
