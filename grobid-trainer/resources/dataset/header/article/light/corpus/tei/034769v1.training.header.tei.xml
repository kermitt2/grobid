	<div type="abstract">As sequencing cost continues to decrease with fast advancing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)<lb/> technologies, variant discovery is becoming a more affordable and popular analysis method among research<lb/> laboratories. Following variant calling and annotation, accurate variant filtering is a crucial step to extract<lb/> meaningful biological information from sequencing data and to investigate disease etiology. However, the<lb/> standard variant call file format (VCF) used to store this valuable information is not easy to handle without<lb/> bioinformatics skills, thus preventing investigators from directly analysing their data. Here, we present<lb/> BrowseVCF, an easy-to-use stand-alone software that enables researchers to browse, query and filter millions<lb/> of variants in a few seconds. Top features include the possibility to store intermediate search results, to query<lb/> user-defined gene lists, to group samples for family or tumour/normal studies, to download a report of the filters<lb/> applied, and to export the filtered variants in spreadsheet format. Additionally, BrowseVCF is suitable for any<lb/> DNA variant analysis (exome, whole-genome and targeted sequencing), can be used also for non-diploid<lb/> genomes, and is able to discriminate between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Insertions/Deletions<lb/> (InDels), and Multiple Nucleotide Polymorphisms (MNPs). Thanks to its portable implementation, BrowseVCF<lb/> can be used either on personal computers or as part of automated analysis pipelines. The software can be<lb/> initialised with a few clicks on any operating system without any special administrative or installation<lb/> permissions, and is freely available for download from https://github.com/BSGOxford/BrowseVCF.</div>
