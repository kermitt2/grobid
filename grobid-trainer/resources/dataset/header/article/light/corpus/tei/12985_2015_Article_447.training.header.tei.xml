	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in serum of chronically infected patients declines by 3-4 log 10 units at<lb/> loss of HBe antigen (HBeAg) from serum. The mechanisms behind this decline, and the much smaller decline of<lb/> surface antigen (HBsAg) levels, are still not well known. The aim of this study was to get a better understanding of<lb/> this process by analysing both serum and intrahepatic markers of HBV replication.<lb/> Methods: Levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg in serum, and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), pregenomic RNA<lb/> (pgRNA) and S-RNA and total intrahepatic HBV DNA (ihDNA) in liver biopsies from 84 chronically infected patients<lb/> (16 positive and 68 negative for HBeAg) were analysed.<lb/> Results: Lower HBV DNA levels within HBeAg-positive stage reflected lower levels of cccDNA and pgRNA with<lb/> strong correlation. In HBeAg-negative patients, ihDNA levels were greater and HBV DNA levels in serum lower than<lb/> expected from pgRNA levels. A lower HBV DNA/HBsAg ratio corresponded with lower pgRNA/cccDNA (p &lt; 0.01)<lb/> and higher S-RNA/cccDNA (p &lt; 0.0001) ratios, suggesting that in HBeAg-negative patients transcription of pgRNA,<lb/> but not of S-RNA, becomes suppressed.<lb/> Conclusions: The marked reduction of HBV DNA in serum after loss of HBeAg appears to be due to combined<lb/> reduction of cccDNA, pgRNA and yet unidentified mechanisms downstream of reverse transcription. Such mechanisms<lb/> include faster clearance of circulating virus or blocked secretion of virions, the latter supported by the observed relative<lb/> increase of ihDNA in HBeAg-negative patients. The smaller reduction of S-RNA than of pgRNA partly explains why<lb/> HBsAg remain high in the HBeAg-negative stage, supporting the possibility of HBsAg synthesis from integrated<lb/> HBV DNA.<lb/></div>
