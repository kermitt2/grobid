	<div type="abstract">Shigellosis, a bacillary dysentery, is closely associated with diarrhoea in human and causes infection of 165 million people<lb/> worldwide per year. Casein-degrading serine protease autotransporter of enterobacteriaceae (SPATE) subfamily protein SigA, an<lb/> outer membrane protein, exerts both cytopathic and enterotoxic effects especially cytopathic to human epithelial cell type-2<lb/> (HEp-2) and is shown to be highly immunogenic. In the present study, we have tried to impose the vaccinomics approach for<lb/> designing a common peptide vaccine candidate against the immunogenic SigA of Shigella spp. At first, 44 SigA proteins from<lb/> different variants of S. flexneri, S. dysenteriae, S. boydii, and S. sonnei were assessed to find the most antigenic protein. We<lb/> retrieved 12 peptides based on the highest score for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) supertypes analysed by NetCTL. Initially,<lb/> these peptides were assessed for the affinity with MHC class I and class II alleles, and four potential core epitopes<lb/> VTARAGLGY, FHTVTVNTL, HTTWTLTGY, and IELAGTLTL were selected. From these, FHTVTVNTL and IELAGTLTL<lb/> peptides were shown to have 100% conservancy. Finally, IELAGTLTL was shown to have the highest population coverage<lb/> (83.86%) among the whole world population. In vivo study of the proposed epitope might contribute to the development of<lb/> functional and unique widespread vaccine, which might be an operative alleyway to thwart dysentery from the world.<lb/></div>
