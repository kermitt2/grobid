	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The hypothesis that interspecific hybridisation promotes invasiveness has received much recent<lb/> attention, but tests of the hypothesis can suffer from important limitations. Here, we provide the<lb/> first systematic review of studies experimentally testing the hybridisation-invasion (H-I) hypothesis<lb/> in plants, animals and fungi. We identified 72 hybrid systems for which hybridisation has been<lb/> putatively associated with invasiveness, weediness or range expansion. Within this group, 15 sys-<lb/>tems (comprising 34 studies) experimentally tested performance of hybrids vs. their parental spe-<lb/>cies and met our other criteria. Both phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic meta-analyses<lb/> demonstrated that wild hybrids were significantly more fecund and larger than their parental taxa,<lb/> but did not differ in survival. Resynthesised hybrids (which typically represent earlier generations<lb/> than do wild hybrids) did not consistently differ from parental species in fecundity, survival or<lb/> size. Using meta-regression, we found that fecundity increased (but survival decreased) with gener-<lb/>ation in resynthesised hybrids, suggesting that natural selection can play an important role in<lb/> shaping hybrid performance -and thus invasiveness -over time. We conclude that the available<lb/> evidence supports the H-I hypothesis, with the caveat that our results are clearly driven by tests in<lb/> plants, which are more numerous than tests in animals and fungi.<lb/></div>
