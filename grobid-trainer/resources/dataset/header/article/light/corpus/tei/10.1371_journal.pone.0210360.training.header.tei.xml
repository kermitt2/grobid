	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Severe dengue cases have been increasingly reported in Thailand, and the under-reporting<lb/> of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cases of dengue viral infection has become an obstacle in<lb/> obtaining an accurate description of the true nature and epidemiology of AKI. Because AKI<lb/> may lead to patient morbidity and mortality, an early diagnosis is important in preventing its<lb/> onset in dengue patients. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical and labora-<lb/>tory characteristics, and associated factors of AKI among adult dengue patients. This retro-<lb/>spective study reviewed admission data from the medical records of adult dengue patients<lb/> admitted to the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases between January 2012 and Novem-<lb/>ber 2017 and stratified these patients into AKI and non-AKI groups using the Kidney Dis-<lb/>ease Improving Global Outcomes criteria (KDIGO). A total of 1,484 patients were included<lb/> in the study, with 71 categorized into the AKI group. The prevalence of AKI was 4.8%. In the<lb/> AKI group, the predominant age range was 18-40 years (71.8%), with a female to male<lb/> ratio of 1:2.7. These patients showed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher proportions of altered<lb/> consciousness, dyspnea, low mean arterial blood pressure, high-grade fever, major bleed-<lb/>ing, severe thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, severe transaminitis, coagulopathy, met-<lb/>abolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, proteinuria, hematuria, and pyuria. Our study established<lb/> that older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, obesity, severe dengue, and coexisting bacterial<lb/> infection were significant associated factors for AKI in dengue by multivariate analysis. A<lb/> total of 10 (14.1%) patients with AKI received dialysis, among which 9 (12.7%) patients from<lb/> the AKI group died. Our findings suggest that an awareness of AKI, its early diagnosis, and<lb/> evaluation of clinical and laboratory characteristics of dengue patients will help clinicians to<lb/> initiate appropriate therapy for dengue-associated AKI.<lb/></div>
