	<div type="abstract">The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila avoids<lb/> fusion with lysosomes and subverts membrane transport from<lb/> the endoplasmic reticulum to create an organelle that supports<lb/> bacterial replication 1,2 . Transport of endoplasmic reticulum-<lb/>derived vesicles to the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV)<lb/> requires bacterial proteins that are translocated into host cells<lb/> by a type IV secretion apparatus called Dot/Icm 3-7 . Recent<lb/> observations have revealed recruitment of the host GTPase Rab1<lb/> to the LCV by a process requiring the Dot/Icm system 8,9 . Here, a<lb/> visual screen was used to identify L. pneumophila mutants with<lb/> defects in Rab1 recruitment. One of the factors identified in this<lb/> screen was DrrA, a new Dot/Icm substrate protein translocated<lb/> into host cells. We show that DrrA is a potent and highly specific<lb/> Rab1 guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF). DrrA can<lb/> disrupt Rab1-mediated secretory transport to the Golgi apparatus<lb/> by competing with endogenous exchange factors to recruit and<lb/> activate Rab1 on plasma membrane-derived organelles. These<lb/> data establish that intracellular pathogens have the capacity to<lb/> directly modulate the activation state of a specific member of<lb/> the Rab family of GTPases and thus further our understanding of<lb/> the mechanisms used by bacterial pathogens to manipulate host<lb/> vesicular transport.<lb/></div>
