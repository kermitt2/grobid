	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Episodic memory, our ability to remember specific events, varies considerably across<lb/> individuals. However, little is known about the neural basis of this variability. To address<lb/> this issue, we investigated the role of distributed networks of oscillatory activity, as<lb/> measured through electroencephalography (EEG). We observed that individual<lb/> differences in alpha network structure reliably predict individual memory capacity.<lb/> Specifically, individuals whose network profiles during encoding were most different<lb/> from their resting state networks exhibited greatest subsequent memory performance,<lb/> suggesting that optimal information processing requires substantial shifts in large-scale<lb/> oscillatory organization. Furthermore, these results were not observed in circumscribed<lb/> topographical regions or individual connections, indicating that distributed network<lb/> approaches were more sensitive to functional processes than more conventional<lb/> methods. These findings uncover a physiological correlate of individual differences in<lb/> episodic memory and demonstrate the utility of multivariate EEG techniques to uncover<lb/> brain-behavior correlates.</div>
