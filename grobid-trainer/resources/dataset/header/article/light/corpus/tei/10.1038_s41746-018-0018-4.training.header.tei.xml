	<div type="abstract">To identify digital biomarkers associated with cognitive function, we analyzed human-computer interaction from 7 days of<lb/> smartphone use in 27 subjects (ages 18-34) who received a gold standard neuropsychological assessment. For several<lb/> neuropsychological constructs (working memory, memory, executive function, language, and intelligence), we found a family of<lb/> digital biomarkers that predicted test scores with high correlations (p &lt; 10 −4 ). These preliminary results suggest that passive<lb/> measures from smartphone use could be a continuous ecological surrogate for laboratory-based neuropsychological assessment.<lb/></div>
