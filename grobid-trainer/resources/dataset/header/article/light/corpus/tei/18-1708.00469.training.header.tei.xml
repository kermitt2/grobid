	<div type="abstract">The properties of bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are known to vary in terms of their param-<lb/>eters. In this work, an experimental approach, including pattern recognition concepts and methods<lb/> such as principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), was used to<lb/> experimentally investigate the variation among BJTs belonging to integrated circuits known as tran-<lb/>sistor arrays. It was shown that a good deal of the devices variance can be captured using only two<lb/> PCA axes. It was also verified that, though substantially small variation of parameters is observed<lb/> for BJT from the same array, larger variation arises between BJTs from distinct arrays, suggest-<lb/>ing the consideration of device characteristics in more critical analog designs. As a consequence<lb/> of its supervised nature, LDA was able to provide a substantial separation of the BJT into clus-<lb/>ters, corresponding to each transistor array. In addition, the LDA mapping into two dimensions<lb/> revealed a clear relationship between the considered measurements. Interestingly, a specific mapping<lb/> suggested by the PCA, involving the total harmonic distortion variation expressed in terms of the<lb/> average voltage gain, yielded an even better separation between the transistor array clusters.<lb/></div>
