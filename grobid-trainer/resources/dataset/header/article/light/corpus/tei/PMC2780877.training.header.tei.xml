	<div type="abstract">OBJECTIVE-Haptoglobin (Hp) binds free Hb, inhibiting Hb-<lb/>induced oxidative damage. As oxidative stress has been associ-<lb/>ated with microvascular complications, we evaluated the<lb/> relationship between Hp genotype and microalbuminuria, mac-<lb/>roalbuminuria, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and early renal<lb/> function decline in type 1 diabetes.<lb/> RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Participants from the<lb/> Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study with DNA avail-<lb/>able were studied for the incidence of microalbuminuria (albu-<lb/>min excretion rate [AER] 20 -200 g/min), macroalbuminuria<lb/> (AER Ͼ200 g/min), ESRD (renal dialysis or transplantation),<lb/> and renal function decline (a decline Ն30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2<lb/> from baseline estimated [by the Cockcroft-Gault equation] glo-<lb/>merular filtration rate [eGFR] in those with baseline eGFR Ͼ60<lb/> ml/min per 1.73 m 2 ).<lb/> RESULTS-The proportions with the Hp 2/2, 2/1, and 1/1<lb/> genotype were 43.4, 44.4, and 12.1%, respectively. During 18 years<lb/> of follow-up, the incidence of eGFR decline, microalbuminuria,<lb/> macroalbuminuria, and ESRD was 42.0, 40.5, 16.7, and 12.2%,<lb/> respectively. No significant univariate differences were ob-<lb/>served by Hp genotype. However, in multivariable Cox mod-<lb/>els, an ϳtwofold increased risk was observed for the Hp 2/2<lb/> compared with the Hp 1/1 genotype for eGFR decline (hazard<lb/> ratio 1.79 [95% CI 1.06 -3.00]) and ESRD (2.74 [1.17-6.45]); no<lb/> significant associations were observed for microalbuminuria<lb/> or macroalbuminuria.<lb/> CONCLUSIONS-These data suggest that although Hp geno-<lb/>type is not associated with albuminuria per se, it may be an<lb/> independent determinant of early renal function decline and<lb/> progression to ESRD. Understanding these apparent contradic-<lb/>tory findings may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of<lb/> renal disease in type 1 diabetes.</div>
