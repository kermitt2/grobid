	<div type="abstract">This article presents the fingertip forces and moments data of the individual fingers and thumb when<lb/> the thumb was placed on an unsteady platform, when the mass of the handle was systematically<lb/> increased and when the thumb normal force was restricted while grasping a handle. Further, this<lb/> article also includes a dataset while the thumb makes vertical movements such as extension (or<lb/> upward motion) and flexion movement (or downward motion) during the static holding of a handle.<lb/> An instrumented five-finger prehension handle was designed with a vertical railing on the thumb<lb/> side. A slider platform was placed over the railing to mount the thumb force sensor. Further, a<lb/> laser displacement sensor was mounted on top of the handle towards the thumb side to record the<lb/> displacement of the thumb platform. The dataset includes fingertip forces, orientation of the handle,<lb/> and the displacement data of thumb platform. This data helps therapists assess the degree of thumb<lb/> disability, the contribution of ulnar fingers in establishing static equilibrium of a handheld object.<lb/></div>
