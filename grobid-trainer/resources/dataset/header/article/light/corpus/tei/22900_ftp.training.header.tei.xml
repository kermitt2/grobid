	Abstract:
	<div type="abstract">To investigate the health-related quality of life<lb/> (HrQoL) of adult patients with Gilles de la Tourette&apos;s syn-<lb/>drome (GTS) in Germany. HrQoL was evaluated in 200 adult<lb/> patients with GTS (Mean age: 34.9 6 11.8 years). Patients<lb/> were recruited from three outpatient departments in Germany<lb/> and completed a semi-structured, self-rating interview.<lb/> HrQoL was measured using the EQ-5D. Depression was<lb/> assessed using the Beck&apos;s depression inventory (BDI) and<lb/> clinical symptoms using the Yale Tourette syndrome symp-<lb/>tom list (TSSL) and the Shapiro Tourette-syndrome severity<lb/> scale (STSSS). Multivariate regression analyses were per-<lb/>formed to identify independent predictors of HrQoL. Patients<lb/> with GTS proved to have a worse HrQoL than a sample<lb/> from the general German population. The domains most<lb/> affected were anxiety/depression (57.1%), followed by pain/<lb/> discomfort (47.5%), usual activities (38.4%), mobility (14%),<lb/> and self-care (6.6%). The mean EQ-5D visual analog scale<lb/> (EQ-VAS) was 65.4 6 21.9. The patients had a mean BDI<lb/> score of 12.3 6 9.9, which was considerably worse compared<lb/> to a healthy group who had a score of 6.45 6 5.2. The mean<lb/> STSSS value was 3.2 6 1.1. In multivariate analyses,<lb/> depressive symptoms contributed considerably, whereas the<lb/> severity of symptoms as well as age only contributed<lb/> minimally to HrQoL in the model (R 2 5 0.54). HrQoL is<lb/> considerably reduced in adult patients with GTS. The main<lb/> independent factors for determining HrQoL were depression,<lb/> severity of symptoms, and age. Although, treatment of tics is<lb/> important, co-morbidities such as depression should be diag-<lb/>nosed and treated vigorously.<lb/></div>
