	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Obesity is the disease accumulating excessive fat in the body. The<lb/> prevalence of obesity and related metabolic disorders is increasing every<lb/> year worldwide. Immunologically, obesity is a chronic low-grade<lb/> inflammatory state with the increase of M1 macrophages and decrease of<lb/> regulatory T cells (Tregs). IL-2/anti-IL-2 complex (IL-2C) and hyperbaric<lb/> oxygen (HBO) are known to expand Tregs in vivo and suppress<lb/> inflammation. Therefore, in this study, IL-2C and HBO were investigated<lb/> for the preventive effect of obesity and related metabolic disorders. Male<lb/> C57BL/6 mice were fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks, and<lb/> counterparts were fed with a low-fat diet (LFD). At the end of the<lb/> experiment, the body weight gain and impaired glucose metabolism,<lb/> elevated levels of insulin and total cholesterol induced by HFD were<lb/> improved by the individual or combination treatment with Il-2C and HBO.<lb/> Histological examination of the epididymal white adipose tissue showed<lb/> adipocyte hypertrophy and many crown-like structures in the HFD control<lb/> groups. In addition, the liver showed the progression of non-alcoholic fatty<lb/> liver disease (NAFLD) in the HFD control groups, but it was significantly<lb/> improved by the individual or combination treatment with IL-2C and HBO.</div>
