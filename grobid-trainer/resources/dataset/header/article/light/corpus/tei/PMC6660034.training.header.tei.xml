	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">As a marker of neuroaxonal injury, neurofilament light (NFL) in blood is robustly elevated in many<lb/> neurodegenerative conditions. We aimed to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with<lb/> longitudinal changes in plasma NFL levels that affect the risk of developing neurodegenerative disease and<lb/> clinical disease progression. 545 eligible non-Hispanic white participants from the Alzheimer&apos;s Disease<lb/> Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with longitudinal plasma NFL data were included. Three SNPs (rs16840041,<lb/> p=4.50×10 -8 ; rs2269714, p=4.50×10 -8 ; rs2269715, p=4.83×10 -8 ) in CD1A were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD)<lb/> and significantly associated with the increase in plasma NFL levels. We demonstrate a promoting effect of<lb/> rs16840041-A on clinical disease progression (p = 0.006). Moreover, the minor allele (A) of rs16840041 was<lb/> significantly associated with accelerated decline in [ 18 F] Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) (estimate -1.6% per year<lb/> [95% CI -0.6 to -2.6], p=0.0024). CD1A is a gene involved in longitudinal changes in plasma NFL levels and AD-<lb/>related phenotypes among non-demented elders. Given the potential effects of these variants, CD1A should be<lb/> further investigated as a gene of interest in neurodegenerative diseases and as a potential target for<lb/> monitoring disease trajectories and treating disease.</div>
