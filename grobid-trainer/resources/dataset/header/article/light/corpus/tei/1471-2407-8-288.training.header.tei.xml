	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Rearrangement of the short arm of chromosome 8 (8p) is very common in epithelial<lb/> cancers such as breast cancer. Usually there is an unbalanced translocation breakpoint in 8p12 (29.7<lb/> Mb -38.5 Mb) with loss of distal 8p, sometimes with proximal amplification of 8p11-12.<lb/> Rearrangements in 8p11-12 have been investigated using high-resolution array CGH, but the first<lb/> 30 Mb of 8p are less well characterised, although this region contains several proposed tumour<lb/> suppressor genes.<lb/> Methods: We analysed the whole of 8p by array CGH at tiling-path BAC resolution in 32 breast<lb/> and six pancreatic cancer cell lines. Regions of recurrent rearrangement distal to 8p12 were further<lb/> characterised, using regional fosmid arrays. FISH, and quantitative RT-PCR on over 60 breast<lb/> tumours validated the existence of similar events in primary material.<lb/> Results: We confirmed that 8p is usually lost up to at least 30 Mb, but a few lines showed focal<lb/> loss or copy number steps within this region. Three regions showed rearrangements common to<lb/> at least two cases: two regions of recurrent loss and one region of amplification. Loss within 8p23.3<lb/> (0 Mb -2.2 Mb) was found in six cell lines. Of the genes always affected, ARHGEF10 showed a point<lb/> mutation of the remaining normal copies in the DU4475 cell line. Deletions within 12.7 Mb -19.1<lb/> Mb in 8p22, in two cases, affected TUSC3. A novel amplicon was found within 8p21.3 (19.1 Mb -<lb/>23.4 Mb) in two lines and one of 98 tumours.<lb/> Conclusion: The pattern of rearrangements seen on 8p may be a consequence of the high density<lb/> of potential targets on this chromosome arm, and ARHGEF10 may be a new candidate tumour<lb/> suppressor gene.<lb/></div>
