	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Male condoms are important to prevent transmission of HIV (and other STIs) and unwanted<lb/> pregnancies. Research was conducted to evaluate the quality of male condoms available in<lb/> the Dominican Republic market based on preliminary concerns of suspect product. Based<lb/> on international testing standards (ISO 4074 and ASTM D 3492-08), condoms were sam-<lb/>pled across ten prominent brands within the market and evaluated for airburst pressure / vol-<lb/>ume, freedom from holes, visual defects, package seal integrity, packaging and marking,<lb/> lubricant quantity, and dimensions. Five of the brands were found to have extensive quality<lb/> problems, where holes were found in 5.7% to 17.5% of the condoms (depending on the<lb/> brand). Between 5.1% and 30.5% of these condoms failed to meet the requirements for air-<lb/>burst properties, and violations in regulatory labeling where observed. Three additional<lb/> brands were compliant for the other tests, but were found to have the same challenges with<lb/> labeling violations as the previous five brands. Two brands were found to be fully compliant<lb/> with all aspects of the evaluation. The level of defects observed in these samples would<lb/> greatly increase the risk of HIV transmission (and other STIs) and unwanted pregnancies.<lb/> When projected on the annual market of male condoms sold in the Dominican Republic<lb/> (~26 million), potentially over 1 million condoms could be estimated to adversely impact the<lb/> health risk of the end-user. These results prompted action by the Dominican Republic regu-<lb/>latory authorities to investigate and remove poor quality product from the market. This<lb/> research study emphasizes the need for continued vigilance towards increased regulatory<lb/> and market surveillance efforts to better protect public health interests.<lb/></div>
