	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of smoking on the risk of microvascular<lb/> complications; however, few have also examined the potential mediating effects of glycemic<lb/> control. Using data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT 1983-1993),<lb/> we describe the acute and long-term risks of smoking on glycemic control and microvascular<lb/> complications in a well-characterized cohort of participants with type 1 diabetes. The DCCT<lb/> recorded self-reported smoking behaviors, glycemic exposure based on HbA1c, and compli-<lb/>cations status. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess whether time-depen-<lb/>dent measurements of smoking predict HbA1c levels. Cox proportional hazard models were<lb/> used to assess time-dependent smoking exposures as predictors of retinopathy and<lb/> nephropathy. During a mean of 6.5 years of follow-up, current smokers had consistently<lb/> higher HbA1c values and were at a higher risk of retinopathy and nephropathy compared<lb/> with former and never smokers. These risk differences were attenuated after adjusting for<lb/> HbA1c suggesting that the negative association of smoking on glycemic control is partially<lb/> responsible for the adverse association of smoking on the risk of complications in type 1 dia-<lb/>betes. These findings support the potential for a beneficial effect of smoking cessation on<lb/> complications in type 1 diabetes.<lb/></div>
