	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Flowering plants express several LIM-domain proteins related to the animal CRP proteins.<lb/> The expression of sunflower LIM genes was followed by RT-PCR in cultured sunflower<lb/> protoplasts. A transcript was detected only for HaWLIM1, but not for the other two genes<lb/> HaPLIM1 and HaPLIM2. Polyclonal antibodies raised against either full length recombinant<lb/> HaWLIM1 protein or peptides recognized a 27 kDa polypeptide on western blots.<lb/> Immunocytolocalization studies showed that HaWLIM1 is located in the cytoplasm and in the<lb/> nucleus. In the cytoplasm, HaWLIM1 is localized in punctate structures, which finely<lb/> decorate microtubule bundles. Depolymerising microtubules with oryzalin resulted in a strong<lb/> modification of the HaWLIM1 cortical pattern. In contrast, treatment of protoplasts with<lb/> latrunculin B, which disrupts actin filaments, had no effect on HaWLIM1 localization.<lb/> HaWLIM1 was also located within the nucleus of interphase protoplasts. During mitosis,<lb/> nuclear labelling was observed in prophase, which decreased in metaphase, disappeared in<lb/> anaphase, and recovered in telophase. These results suggest a dual role for HaWLIM1: in the<lb/> cytoplasm, as a component of molecular complexes which may interact with microtubules,<lb/> and in the nucleus, as a partner of transcription factors during interphase.<lb/></div>
