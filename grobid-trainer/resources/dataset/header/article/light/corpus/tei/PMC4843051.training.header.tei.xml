	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is an extremely rare, relatively new, and distinct histological pattern of<lb/> acute lung injury characterized predominately by the presence of intra-alveolar fibrin and associated organizing pneumonia.<lb/> AFOP may be idiopathic or associated with a wide spectrum of clinical conditions. It has a variable clinical presentation from<lb/> mild respiratory symptoms to that similar to the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently there is no consensus on<lb/> treatment, and corticosteroids previously were of unclear benefit. To date, there are less than 40 cases of AFOP reported in<lb/> the literature and only one has been linked to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Here we report the first case series<lb/> of 2 patients who developed AFOP following allogenic stem cell transplant that were successfully treated with high-dose<lb/> corticosteroids.<lb/></div>
