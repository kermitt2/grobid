	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Cold atmospheric pressure helium plasma jets are increasingly used in many processing<lb/> applications, due to a distinct combination of their inherent plasma stability with<lb/> excellent reaction chemistry often enhanced downstream. Despite their widespread<lb/> usage, it remains largely unknown whether cold atmospheric plasma jets maintain<lb/> similar characteristics from breakdown to arcing or whether they possess different<lb/> operating modes. In addition to their known ability to produce a fast moving train of<lb/> discrete luminous clusters along the jet length, commonly known as plasma bullets, this<lb/> paper reports evidence of two additional modes of operation, namely a chaotic mode<lb/> and a continuous mode in an atmospheric helium plasma jet. Through detailed<lb/> electrical and optical characterisation, it is shown that immediately following breakdown<lb/> the plasma jet operates in a deterministic chaotic mode. With increasing input power,<lb/> the discharge becomes periodic and the jet plasma is found to produce at least one<lb/> strong plasma bullet every cycle of the applied voltage. Further increase in input power<lb/> eventually leads to the continuous mode in which excited species are seen to remain<lb/> within the inter-electrode space throughout the entire cycle of the applied voltage.<lb/> Transition from the chaotic, through the bullet, to the continuous modes is abrupt and<lb/> distinct, with each mode having a unique set of operating characteristics. For the bullet<lb/> mode, direct evidence is presented to demonstrate that the evolution of the plasma jet<lb/> involves a repeated sequence of generation, collapse and regeneration of the plasma<lb/> head occurring at locations progressively towards the instantaneous cathode. These<lb/> offer previously unavailable insight into plasma jet formation mechanisms and the<lb/> potential of matching plasma jet modes to specific needs of a given processing<lb/> application.<lb/></div>
