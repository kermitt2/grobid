	Short title: Comparison of de-duplication methods in the surveillance of AMR<lb/> 

	Abstract <lb/>
	<div type="abstract">A major issue in the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is &quot;de-<lb/>duplication&quot; or removal of repeated isolates, for which there exist multiple methods. <lb/>The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance <lb/>System (GLASS) requires de-duplication by selecting only the first isolate of a given <lb/>bacterial species per patient per surveillance period per specimen type per age group, <lb/>gender, and infection origin stratification. However, no study on the comparative <lb/>application of this method has been reported. The objective of this study was to evaluate <lb/>differences in data tabulation between the WHO GLASS and the Japan Nosocomial <lb/>Infections Surveillance (JANIS) system, which counts both patients and isolates after <lb/>removing repeated isolates of the same bacterial species per multiresistance phenotype <lb/>isolated from a patient within 30 days, regardless of specimen type. All bacterial data, <lb/>consisting of approximately 8 million samples from 1795 Japanese hospitals in 2017 <lb/>were exported from the JANIS database, and were tabulated using either the de-<lb/>duplication algorithm of GLASS, or JANIS. We compared the tabulated results of the <lb/>total number of patients whose blood and urine cultures were taken and of the <lb/>percentage of resistant isolates of Escherichia coli for each priority antibiotic. The <lb/>number of patients per specimen type tabulated by the JANIS method was always<lb/> smaller than that of GLASS. There was a small (&lt; 3%) difference in the percentage of<lb/> resistance of E. coli for any antibiotic between the two methods in both out-and<lb/> inpatient settings and blood and urine isolates. The two tabulation methods did not show<lb/> considerable differences in terms of the tabulated percentages of resistance for E. coli.<lb/> We further discuss how the use of GLASS tabulations to create a public software and<lb/> website that could help to facilitate the understanding of and treatment against AMR.<lb/></div>
