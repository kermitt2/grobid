	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Previous studies, including our own, have reported that spermatozoa isolated from the testis<lb/> have remarkably higher occurrence of aneuploidy once isolated from azoospermic men.<lb/> This notion, however, did not translate into a lower pregnancy rate nor a greater proportion<lb/> of miscarriages. Indeed, ICSI offspring generated from surgically retrieved gametes did not<lb/> suffer from increased karyotypic aneuploidy than children generated from ejaculated speci-<lb/>mens. In recent years, aneuploidy assessments on a larger number of cells and utilizing<lb/> more chromosome probes have reported a progressive decrease in chromosomal aberra-<lb/>tions in spermatozoa directly retrieved from the seminiferous tubules. In light of the availabil-<lb/>ity of more accurate molecular genetic techniques, we have decided to challenge the notion<lb/> that sampling epididymal and testicular tissues yields spermatozoa with higher incidence of<lb/> aneuploidy than those retrieved in the ejaculate. In a retrospective manner, we have carried<lb/> out an analysis by FISH with 9 chromosome probes on at least 1000 cells from the ejacu-<lb/>lates of 87 consenting men and the specimens of 6 azoospermic men, while spermatozoa of<lb/> fertile donors were used as control. Aneuploidy by FISH yielded 0.9% for the donor control<lb/> but rose in the study group to 3.6% in the ejaculated, 1.2% for the epididymal, and 1.1% for<lb/> testicular spermatozoa. There were no differences in autosomal or gonosomal disomies,<lb/> nor nullisomies. In this group, once the specimens of these men were used for ICSI, ejacu-<lb/>lated spermatozoa yielded a 22% clinical pregnancy rate that resulted in 62.5% pregnancy<lb/> loss. The surgically retrieved specimens yielded a 50% clinical pregnancy rate that pro-<lb/>gressed to term. To confirm our findings, in a prospective analysis, DNA sequencing was<lb/> carried out on the ejaculates and surgical samples of 22 men with various spermatogenic<lb/> characteristics. In this comparison, the findings were similar with actually a higher incidence<lb/> of aneuploidy in the ejaculated spermatozoa (n = 16) compared to those surgically retrieved<lb/> (n = 6) (P&lt;0.0001). For this group, the clinical pregnancy rate for the ejaculated specimens<lb/> was 47.2% with 29.4% pregnancy loss, while the surgically retrieved yielded a 50% clinical<lb/> pregnancy rate, all progressing to term. A subsequent prospective combined assessment<lb/> on ejaculated and surgically retrieved spermatozoa by FISH and NGS was performed on<lb/> non-azoospermic men with high DNA fragmentation in their ejaculate. The assessment by<lb/> FISH evidenced 2.8% chromosomal defects in the ejaculated and 1.2% in testicular biopsies<lb/></div>

Interestingly, we evidenced<lb/> a pregnancy rate of 0% with ejaculated while 100% with the testicular spermatozoa in this<lb/> latter group.
