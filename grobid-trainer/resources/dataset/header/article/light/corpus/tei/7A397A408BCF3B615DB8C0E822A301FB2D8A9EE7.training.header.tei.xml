	<div type="abstract">We hypothesized that tendencies to explain interest in peers&apos;<lb/> work in terms of mastery-promotion or of relative ability assessment is related both to the devel-<lb/>opment of the normative conception of ability and to educational emphases on cooperative or<lb/> competitive learning goals. Study 1 tapped acquisition of the normative conception, normative<lb/> self-assessment, and reasons for looking at others&apos; work among 208 kibbutz and urban Israeli<lb/> subjects at ages 4-8. Results confirmed that acquisition of normative understandings was associ-<lb/>ated with a shift from mastery to ability explanations in urban, but not kibbutz, children. Study<lb/> 2 revealed similar differences in the frequency of mastery versus ability assessment reasons<lb/> among 48 kibbutz and urban third-grade children asked to explain the videotaped glances of an<lb/> unfamiliar child. Thus, cooperative learning settings seem to maintain interest in using peers to<lb/> promote mastery, even after acquisition of the normative conception.<lb/></div>
