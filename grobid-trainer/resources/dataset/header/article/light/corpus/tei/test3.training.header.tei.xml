	<div type="abstract">Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a devastating complication of metastatic cancer that disproportionately affects patients with<lb/> advanced breast cancer. Moreover, those with BRCA1/2-mutated disease more often experience leptomeningeal metastasis.<lb/> Treatment options for LC are limited and often include significant toxicities. PARP inhibitors offer an important potential treatment<lb/> for patients with BRCA1/2-mutated breast and ovarian cancers, but clinical studies excluded patients with central nervous system<lb/> (CNS) metastases, including LC. Efficacy data in this area are therefore limited, although a phase I study of olaparib in glioblastoma<lb/> did show CNS penetration. Here we report a case of a patient with BRCA2-mutated breast cancer and solitary recurrence in the<lb/> leptomeninges with ongoing complete response to treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib. PARP inhibitors may be an<lb/> important treatment option for patients with BRCA-mutated disease and LC, and warrant further study.<lb/></div>
