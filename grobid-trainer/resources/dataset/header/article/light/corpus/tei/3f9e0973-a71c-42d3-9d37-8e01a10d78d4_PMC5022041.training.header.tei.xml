	<div type="abstract">There is a commonality among contagious diseases, tweets, and neuronal firings that past events<lb/> facilitate the future occurrence of events. The spread of events has been extensively studied such<lb/> that the systems exhibit catastrophic chain reactions if the interaction represented by the ratio of<lb/> reproduction exceeds unity; however, their subthreshold states are not fully understood. Here, we<lb/> report that these systems are possessed by nonstationary cascades of event-occurrences already in the<lb/> subthreshold regime. Event cascades can be harmful in some contexts, when the peak-demand causes<lb/> vaccine shortages, heavy traffic on communication lines, but may be beneficial in other contexts, such<lb/> that spontaneous activity in neural networks may be used to generate motion or store memory. Thus<lb/> it is important to comprehend the mechanism by which such cascades appear, and consider controlling<lb/> a system to tame or facilitate fluctuations in the event-occurrences. The critical interaction for the<lb/> emergence of cascades depends greatly on the network structure in which individuals are connected.<lb/> We demonstrate that we can predict whether cascades may emerge, given information about the<lb/> interactions between individuals. Furthermore, we develop a method of reallocating connections<lb/> among individuals so that event cascades may be either impeded or impelled in a network.<lb/></div>
