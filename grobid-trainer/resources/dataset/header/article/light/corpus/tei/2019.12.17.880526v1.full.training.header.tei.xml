	<div type="abstract">Most fungal viruses have been identified in plant pathogens, whereas the presence of viral<lb/> particles in human pathogenic fungi is less well studied. In the present study, we observed<lb/> extrachromosomal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) segments in various clinical isolates of<lb/> Malassezia species. Malassezia is the most dominant fungal genus on the human skin surface,<lb/> and species in this group are considered to be etiological factors in various skin diseases<lb/> including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and atopic dermatitis. We identified novel dsRNA<lb/> segments and our sequencing results revealed that the virus, named MrV40, belongs to the<lb/> Totiviridae family and contains an additional satellite dsRNA segment encoding a novel<lb/> protein. The transcriptome of virus-infected M. restricta cells was compared to that of virus-<lb/>free cells, and the results showed that transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis were<lb/> down regulated and those involved in energy production and programmed cell death were<lb/> increased in abundance. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly<lb/> larger vacuoles for virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection<lb/> dramatically altered M. restricta physiology. Our analysis also revealed that a viral nucleic<lb/> acid from MrV40 induces a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-<lb/>derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and this result suggests that a viral element contributes to<lb/> the pathogenesis of Malassezia.</div>
