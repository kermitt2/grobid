	2 Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been successful in discovering replicable SNP-trait<lb/> associations for many quantitative traits and common diseases in humans. Typically the effect sizes of SNP<lb/> alleles are very small and this has led to large genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAMA) to<lb/> maximize statistical power. A trend towards ever-larger GWAMA is likely to continue, yet dealing with<lb/> summary statistics from hundreds of cohorts increases logistical and quality control problems, including<lb/> unknown sample overlap, and these can lead to both false positive and false negative findings. In this study<lb/> we propose a new set of metrics and visualization tools for GWAMA, using summary statistics from cohort-<lb/>level GWASs. We proposed a pair of methods in examining the concordance between demographic<lb/> information and summary statistics. In method I, we use the population genetics ‫ܨ‬ ௦௧ statistic to verify the<lb/> genetic origin of each cohort and their geographic location, and demonstrate using GWAMA data from the<lb/> GIANT Consortium that geographic locations of cohorts can be recovered and outlier cohorts can be<lb/> detected. In method II, we conduct principal component analysis based on reported allele frequencies, and is<lb/> able to recover the ancestral information for each cohort. In addition, we propose a new statistic that uses the<lb/> reported allelic effect sizes and their standard errors to identify significant sample overlap or heterogeneity<lb/> between pairs of cohorts. Finally, to quantify unknown sample overlap across all pairs of cohorts we propose<lb/> a method that uses randomly generated genetic predictors that does not require the sharing of individual-<lb/>level genotype data and does not breach individual privacy.</div>
