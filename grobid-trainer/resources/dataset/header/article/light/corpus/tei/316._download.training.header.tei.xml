	Abstract:
	<div type="abstract">Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems<lb/> di er in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy<lb/> used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently<lb/> construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general,<lb/> we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively<lb/> constructs a`tentative&apos; clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization,<lb/> which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we<lb/> evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control<lb/> strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modi es an initial clustering<lb/> in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization<lb/> strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by<lb/> analysts { often according to task-speci c criteria. Several authors have abstracted these<lb/> criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error<lb/> rate over completed patterns is used to`externally&apos; judge clustering utility. Given this<lb/> performance task we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning<lb/> systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-<lb/>clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-<lb/>selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and<lb/> simplicity dimensions.<lb/></div>
