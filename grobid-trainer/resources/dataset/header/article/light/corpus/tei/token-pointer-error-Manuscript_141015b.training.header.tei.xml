	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">This paper focuses on the effects of the observation scale and sampling on the dispersion of tracers in<lb/> periodical heterogeneous porous media. A Model Heterogeneous Porous Medium (MHPM) with a<lb/> high degree of heterogeneity was built. It consists of a preferential flow path surrounded by glass<lb/> beads. 44 tracer experiments were carried out on several series of periodic MHPM to investigate the<lb/> effect of the observation scale on solute dispersion. Each series was replicated several times, allowing<lb/> for a statistical description of the unit transfer function of the MHPM. No significant trend was found<lb/> for the dispersion coefficient as a function of the size of the MHPM. However, given the variability of<lb/> the breakthrough curves from one experiment replicate to another, under-sampling might easily lead to<lb/> conclude that the dispersion coefficient is variable with distance. Depending on the samples used, it<lb/> would be as easy to (wrongly) detect an increasing trend as to detect a decreasing one. A confidence<lb/> interval analysis of the experimental breakthrough curves in the Laplace space shows that (i) there<lb/> exists a model with scale independent parameters that can describe the experimental breakthrough<lb/> curves within the limits of experimental uncertainty, (ii) this model is not the Advection-Dispersion<lb/> (AD) model, (iii) the modelling error of the AD model decreases with the number of periods, (iv) the<lb/> size of the Reference Elementary Volume for the dispersion coefficient is between 10 and 20 periods.<lb/> The effects of sampling prove to override those of scaling. This, with the invalidity of the AD model,<lb/> leads to question attempts to calibrate and/or identify trends in the dispersion coefficient at<lb/> intermediate scales from a limited number of experiment replicates.</div>
