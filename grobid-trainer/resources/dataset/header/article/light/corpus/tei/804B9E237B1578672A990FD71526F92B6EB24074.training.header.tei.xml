	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND<lb/> The role of medial defects on cerebral aneurysm forma-<lb/>tion remains obscure. To examine whether cerebral an-<lb/>eurysms originate at the site of medial defects, we deter-<lb/>mined the exact locations of both the origin of<lb/> experimental aneurysms and medial defects at the apex<lb/> of fenestrations of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) in<lb/> rats. METHODS<lb/> Cerebral aneurysms were induced in rats by means of the<lb/> combination of ligation of the unilateral common carotid<lb/> artery and induced hypertension. The ACA opposite the<lb/> ligation was examined under a light microscope. RESULTS<lb/> Medial defects, which could be observed in approxi-<lb/>mately one-half of the fenestrations, existed always<lb/> around the lateral margin of the intimal pads. On the<lb/> contrary, early aneurysmal lesions exclusively occurred<lb/> at the portion just medial to the intimal pads. Subse-<lb/>quently, both pads and defects seemed to be involved in<lb/> aneurysm walls. CONCLUSION<lb/> These results clearly indicate that cerebral aneurysms do<lb/> not originate at the site of medial defects.</div>
