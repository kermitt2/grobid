	Abstract 
	<div type="abstract">Purpose<lb/> The study purpose was to investigate the acceptability and utility of, and preference for,<lb/> wearable activity trackers (WATs) amongst cancer survivors living in regional and remote<lb/> areas of Western Australia. Methods<lb/> Twenty participants were recruited (Mean age = 63 years, SD = 13) to test two to three track-<lb/>ers from five available models (Fitbit Alta, Garmin Vivofit 2, Garmin Vivosmart, Polar loop 2<lb/> and Polar A300). Participants wore each device for two weeks, followed by a one-week<lb/> washout period between devices. Interviews were conducted with participants to explore<lb/> user perceptions and experiences. Interview transcripts were analysed using thematic<lb/> analysis. Results<lb/> Four main themes emerged: (i) Consciousness raising; (ii) Prompts and Feedback; (iii)<lb/> Accuracy and registry of activities; and, (iv) WAT preferences and features. Conclusions<lb/> WATs were acceptable and useful to cancer survivors. WATs increased self-awareness of<lb/> physical activity, provided real time feedback in relation to step goals, and reinforced prog-<lb/>ress and efforts towards goals. The aesthetics of the WATs were deemed crucial in deter-<lb/>mining preference and likelihood of use.<lb/> Implications for cancer survivors<lb/> Future interventions may do well to have two different WATs available for participants to<lb/> choose from, according to activity preferences, aesthetic preferences, and display size.<lb/></div>
