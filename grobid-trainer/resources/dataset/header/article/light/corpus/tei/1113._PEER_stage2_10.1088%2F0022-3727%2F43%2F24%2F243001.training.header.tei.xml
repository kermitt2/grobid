	<div type="abstract">Impact ionization and avalanche multiplication are conventionally described in terms<lb/> of ionization coefficients which depend only upon the local electric field. Such a<lb/> description takes no account of the effect of ionization dead space, within which the<lb/> population distribution, and hence the ionization coefficient of carriers injected cool<lb/> approach equilibrium with the high electric field, inhibiting ionization and reducing<lb/> multiplication. This effect, which increases in importance as device dimensions are<lb/> reduced, clearly benefits such high field devices as transistors by suppressing<lb/> parasitic avalanche multiplication. It also improves the performance of avalanche<lb/> photodiodes (APDs) by reducing the spatial randomness of impact ionization, so that<lb/> the resulting excess multiplication noise is also reduced. It reduces temperature<lb/> sensitivity and may also further enhance APD speed. This article reviews these<lb/> effects and some theoretical models used to describe them.<lb/></div>
