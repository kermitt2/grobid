	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Polyploidy, frequently termed &apos;&apos;whole genome duplication&apos;&apos;, is a major force in the evolution of many<lb/> eukaryotes. Indeed, most angiosperm species have undergone at least one round of polyploidy in their evolutionary history.<lb/> Despite enormous progress in our understanding of many aspects of polyploidy, we essentially have no information about<lb/> the role of chromosome divergence in the establishment of young polyploid populations. Here we investigate synthetic<lb/> lines and natural populations of two recently and recurrently formed allotetraploids Tragopogon mirus and T. miscellus<lb/> (formed within the past 80 years) to assess the role of aberrant meiosis in generating chromosomal/genomic diversity. That<lb/> diversity is likely important in the formation, establishment and survival of polyploid populations and species.<lb/> Methodology/Principal Findings: Applications of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to natural populations of T. mirus<lb/> and T. miscellus suggest that chromosomal rearrangements and other chromosomal changes are common in both<lb/> allotetraploids. We detected extensive chromosomal polymorphism between individuals and populations, including (i)<lb/> plants monosomic and trisomic for particular chromosomes (perhaps indicating compensatory trisomy), (ii) intergenomic<lb/> translocations and (iii) variable sizes and expression patterns of individual ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci. We even observed<lb/> karyotypic variation among sibling plants. Significantly, translocations, chromosome loss, and meiotic irregularities,<lb/> including quadrivalent formation, were observed in synthetic (S 0 and S 1 generations) polyploid lines. Our results not only<lb/> provide a mechanism for chromosomal variation in natural populations, but also indicate that chromosomal changes occur<lb/> rapidly following polyploidisation.<lb/> Conclusions/Significance: These data shed new light on previous analyses of genome and transcriptome structures in de<lb/> novo and establishing polyploid species. Crucially our results highlight the necessity of studying karyotypes in young<lb/> (,150 years old) polyploid species and synthetic polyploids that resemble natural species. The data also provide insight<lb/> into the mechanisms that perturb inheritance patterns of genetic markers in synthetic polyploids and populations of young<lb/> natural polyploid species.<lb/></div>
