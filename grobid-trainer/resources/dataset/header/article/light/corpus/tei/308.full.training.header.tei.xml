	<div type="abstract">Background: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are usually offered systemic chemotherapy as<lb/> palliative treatment. A multivariate analysis was performed in order to identify predictors and their con-<lb/>stellation that allow a valid prediction of the outcome in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-<lb/>based therapy.<lb/> Patients and methods: A total of 3825 patients treated with 5-FU within 19 prospective randomised<lb/> and three phase II trials were separated into learning (n = 2549) and validation (n = 1276) samples. Data<lb/> were analysed by tree analysis using the recursive partition and amalgamation method (RECPAM). A<lb/> predictor could only enter the RECPAM analysis if the number of patients with missing values was<lb/> &lt;33.3% within a node, and the minimal node size was set to 50 patients. Twenty-three potential pre-<lb/>dictors were grouped into subsets of laboratory variables (11 parameters), tumour-related variables<lb/> (seven parameters) and clinical variables (five parameters). In the first step, tree analysis was performed<lb/> separately for each predictor subset. The selected prognostic parameters of the resulting partial models<lb/> (the &apos;winners&apos;) were entered into the general model. The classification rule from the data of the learning<lb/> set was applied to the independent validation set.<lb/> Results: Winners of the subgroup analysis for laboratory variables were: platelets ≥400 × 10 9 /l, alka-<lb/>line phosphatase ≥300 U/l, white blood cell (WBC) count ≥10 × 10 9 /l and haemoglobin &lt;11 × 10 9 /l, and<lb/> all predicted a worse outcome. Negative predictors within the subgroup of tumour parameters were:<lb/> number of tumour sites more than one or more than two, presence of liver metastases or peritoneal<lb/> carcinomatosis, which predicted a worse outcome. Furthermore, presence of lung metastases, a primary<lb/> rectal cancer and presence of lymph node metastases all predicted a better outcome in the multivariate<lb/> setting. Among the clinical parameters only performance status of ECOG 0 or 1 predicted better out-<lb/>come. In the final regression tree, three risk groups could be identified: low risk group (n = 1111) with a<lb/> median survival of 15 months for patients with ECOG 0/1 and only one tumour site; intermediate risk<lb/> group (n = 904) with a median survival of 10.7 months for patients with ECOG 0/1 and more than one<lb/> tumour site and alkaline phosphatase &lt;300 U/l or patients with ECOG &gt;1, WBC count &lt;10 × 10 9 /l and<lb/> only one tumour site; high risk group (n = 534) with a median survival of 6.1 months for patients with<lb/> ECOG 0/1 and more than one tumour site and alkaline phosphatase of ≥300 U/l or patients with ECOG<lb/> &gt;1 and more than one tumour site or WBC count &gt;10 × 10 9 /l. The median survival times for the good,<lb/> intermediate and high risk groups in the validation sample were 14.7, 10.5 and 6.4 months, respectively.<lb/> Conclusions: Patients can be divided into at least three risk groups depending on the four baseline<lb/> clinical parameters: performance status, WBC count, alkaline phosphatase and number of metastatic<lb/> sites. Any molecular or biological marker should be validated against these clinical parameters and<lb/> decisions for more or less intensive treatments may be studied separately in these three risk groups.<lb/> Also, clinical trials should be stratified according to the three risk groups.<lb/></div>
