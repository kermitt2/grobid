	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Employer-sponsored health risk assessments (HRA) may include laboratory tests to provide evidence of<lb/> disease and disease risks for common medical conditions. We evaluated the ability of HRA-laboratory testing to provide new<lb/> disease-risk information to participants.<lb/> Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of HRA-laboratory results for participating adult<lb/> employees and their eligible spouses or their domestic partners, focusing on three common health conditions:<lb/> hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. HRA with laboratory results of 52,270 first-time participants<lb/> were analyzed. Nearly all participants had access to health insurance coverage. Twenty-four percent (12,392) self-reported<lb/> one or more of these medical conditions: 21.1% (11,017) self-identified as having hyperlipidemia, 4.7% (2,479) self-identified<lb/> as having diabetes, and 0.7% (352) self-identified as having chronic kidney disease. Overall, 36% (n = 18,540) of participants<lb/> had laboratory evidence of at least one medical condition newly identified: 30.7% (16,032) had laboratory evidence of<lb/> hyperlipidemia identified, 1.9% (984) had laboratory evidence of diabetes identified, and 5.5% (2,866) had laboratory<lb/> evidence of chronic kidney disease identified. Of all participants with evidence of hyperlipidemia 59% (16,030 of 27,047),<lb/> were newly identified through the HRA. Among those with evidence of diabetes 28% (984 of 3,463) were newly identified.<lb/> The highest rate of newly identified disease risk was for chronic kidney disease: 89% (2,866 of 3,218) of participants with<lb/> evidence of this condition had not self-reported it. Men (39%) were more likely than women (33%) to have at least one<lb/> newly identified condition (p,0.0001). Among men, lower levels of educational achievement were associated with<lb/> modestly higher rates of newly identified disease risk (p,0.0001); the association with educational achievement among<lb/> women was unclear. Even among the youngest age range (20 to 29 year olds), nearly 1 in 4 participants (24%) had a newly<lb/> identified risk for disease.<lb/> Conclusions/Significance: These results support the important role of employer-sponsored laboratory testing as an integral<lb/> element of HRA for identifying evidence of previously undiagnosed common medical conditions in individuals of all<lb/> working age ranges, regardless of educational level and gender.<lb/></div>
