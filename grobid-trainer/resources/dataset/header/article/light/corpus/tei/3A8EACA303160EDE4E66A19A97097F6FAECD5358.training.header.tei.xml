	<div type="abstract">Feedback inhibition at reciprocal synapses between A17 amacrine<lb/> cells and rod bipolar cells (RBCs) shapes light-evoked responses in<lb/> the retina 1-3 . Glutamate-mediated excitation of A17 cells elicits<lb/> GABA (g-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibitory feedback onto<lb/> RBCs 4-6 , but the mechanisms that underlie GABA release from the<lb/> dendrites of A17 cells are unknown. If, as observed at all other<lb/> synapses studied, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) couple<lb/> membrane depolarization to neurotransmitter release 7 , feed-<lb/>forward excitatory postsynaptic potentials could spread through<lb/> A17 dendrites to elicit &apos;surround&apos; feedback inhibitory transmission<lb/> at neighbouring synapses. Here we show, however, that GABA<lb/> release from A17 cells in the rat retina does not depend on VGCCs<lb/> or membrane depolarization. Instead, calcium-permeable AMPA<lb/> (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) recep-<lb/>tors (AMPARs), activated by glutamate released from RBCs, provide<lb/> the calcium influx necessary to trigger GABA release from A17 cells.<lb/> The AMPAR-mediated calcium signal is amplified by calcium-<lb/>induced calcium release (CICR) from intracellular calcium stores.<lb/> These results describe a fast synapse that operates independently<lb/> of VGCCs and membrane depolarization and reveal a previously<lb/> unknown form of feedback inhibition within a neural circuit.</div>
