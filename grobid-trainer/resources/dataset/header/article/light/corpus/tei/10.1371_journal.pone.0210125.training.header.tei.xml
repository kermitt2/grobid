	Abstract 
	<div type="abstract">Objective<lb/> To examine clinico-pathological factors associated with surgical complications and postop-<lb/>erative therapy for clinical stage IB-IIB cervical cancer. Methods<lb/> This nationwide multicenter retrospective study examined women with clinical stage IB-IIB<lb/> cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy plus pelvic and/or para-aortic lympha-<lb/>denectomy between 2008-2009 at 87 institutions of the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology<lb/> Group (n = 693). Multivariate models were used to identify independent predictors of periop-<lb/>erative grade 3-4 complications and bladder dysfunction. Results<lb/> The overall intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were 3.3% and 9.8%,<lb/> respectively. Clinical stage was not associated with perioperative complications (P = 0.15).<lb/> Radiotherapy-based adjuvant therapy was significantly associated with an increased risk of<lb/> postoperative complications (radiotherapy alone: adjusted-odds ratio [OR] 3.19, 95% confi-<lb/>dence interval [CI] 1.46-6.99, P = 0.004; radiotherapy plus chemotherapy: adjusted-OR<lb/> 3.26, 95%CI 1.66-6.41, P = 0.001), whereas chemotherapy was not (P = 0.45). Nerve-spar-<lb/>ing surgery significantly reduced the risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction (adjusted-OR<lb/> 0.57, 95%CI 0.37-0.90, P = 0.02) whereas adjuvant chemotherapy increased the risk of<lb/> bladder dysfunction (adjusted-OR 2.06, 95%CI 1.16-3.67, P = 0.01). Among women receiv-<lb/>ing adjuvant chemotherapy, nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy significantly reduced the<lb/> risk of bladder dysfunction (15.0% versus 32.9%, OR 0.31, 95%CI 0.14-0.68, P = 0.004).<lb/></div>

	<note type="availability">Data cannot be<lb/> shared publicly because our study used the<lb/> Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG)<lb/> data, a nationwide study composed by the<lb/> Committee on Treatment Guidelines for Cervical<lb/> Cancer in Japan.

Please refer to the following<lb/> After propensity score matching, survival outcomes were similar with both types of adjuvant<lb/> therapy (radiotherapy-based versus chemotherapy, P&gt;0.05). Conclusion<lb/> Our study highlighted two distinct complication profiles of adjuvant therapy after radical hys-<lb/>terectomy for clinical stage IB-IIB cervical cancer, with radiotherapy increasing grade 3-4<lb/> adverse events and chemotherapy increasing bladder dysfunction. In this setting, nerve-<lb/>sparing surgery may be useful if chemotherapy is being considered for adjuvant therapy.<lb/> address for more information: https://jgog.gr.jp/en/<lb/> coi.html.
