	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Achieving control of hypertension prevents target organ damage at both the micro<lb/> and macrovascular level and is a highly cost effective means of lowering the risk for heart attack<lb/> and stroke particularly in people with diabetes. Clinical trials demonstrate that blood pressure<lb/> control can be achieved in a large proportion of people. Translating this knowledge into widespread<lb/> practice is the focus of the Hypertension Management Initiative, which began in 2004 with the goal<lb/> of improving the management of this chronic health condition by primary care providers and<lb/> patients in the community.<lb/> Methods: This study will test the effect of a systems change on the management of high blood<lb/> pressure in real world practice in primary care in Ontario, Canada. The systems change<lb/> intervention involves an interprofessional educational program bringing together physicians, nurses<lb/> and pharmacists with tools for both providers and patients to facilitate blood pressure<lb/> management. Each of two waves of subjects were enrolled over a 6 month period with the initial<lb/> enrollment between waves separated by 9 months. Blood pressure will be measured with the<lb/> BpTru ® automated blood pressure device. To determine the effectiveness of the intervention, a<lb/> before and after analysis within all subjects will compare blood pressure at baseline to annual<lb/> measurements for the three year study. To assess whether the intervention has an impact on blood<lb/> pressure control independent of community trends, a betwen group comparison of baseline blood<lb/> pressures in the delayed wave will be made with the immediate wave during the same time period,<lb/> so that the immediate wave has experienced the intervention for at least 9 months. The total<lb/> enrollment goal is 5,000 subjects. The practice locations include 10 Family Health Teams (FHTs)<lb/> and 1 Community Health Centre (CHC) and approximately 49 primary care physicians, 15 nurse<lb/> practitioners, 37 registered nurses and over 150 community pharmacists across the 11<lb/> communities throughout the province of Ontario. The 11 primary care sites will be divided into<lb/> immediate and delayed groups based on geography and the use of an electronic versus a traditional<lb/> chart patient record.<lb/></div>
