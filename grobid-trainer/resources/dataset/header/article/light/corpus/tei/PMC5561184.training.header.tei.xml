	<div type="abstract">Polysialic acid (PSA) and its major protein carrier, the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM, play<lb/> important roles in many nervous system functions during development and in adulthood. Here, we show<lb/> that a PSA-carrying NCAM fragment is generated at the plasma membrane by matrix metalloproteases<lb/> and transferred to the cell nucleus via endosomes and the cytoplasm. Generation and nuclear import of<lb/> this fragment in cultured cerebellar neurons is induced by a function-triggering NCAM antibody and a<lb/> peptide comprising the effector domain (ED) of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS)<lb/> which interacts with PSA within the plane of the plasma membrane. These treatments lead to activation<lb/> of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) and<lb/> phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and subsequently to phosphorylation of MARCKS. Moreover, the<lb/> NCAM antibody triggers calmodulin-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide (NO)<lb/> production, NO-dependent S-nitrosylation of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) as well as activation<lb/> of matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) and MMP9, whereas the ED peptide activates phospholipase D<lb/> (PLD) and MMP2, but not MMP9. These results indicate that the nuclear PSA-carrying NCAM fragment is<lb/> generated by distinct and functionally defined signal transducing mechanisms.</div>
