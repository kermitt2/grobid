	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Access to shared data is provided today by distributed file systems and<lb/> databases. In this paper, we explore certain usage and technological trends that<lb/> will radically change the way shared data is used in the future. The usage trends<lb/> include the growing need to access shared data from anywhere, increasing scale,<lb/> and the increasing importance of efficient search. The technology trends include<lb/> the advent of portable machines, the availability of software and hardware for<lb/> using diverse types of data, and the growing diversity of network speeds and<lb/> capabilities. These trends induce fundamental research problems in the areas of<lb/> adaptive system behavior, secure remote execution and extensibility.<lb/></div>
