	Abstract:
	<div type="abstract">This study evaluated the effects of growth medium, temperature, and incubation<lb/> time on biofilm formation by Enterobacter cloacae strains. The ability to adhere to a<lb/> surface was demonstrated using a microtiter plate adherence assay whereas the role of cell<lb/> surface properties in biofilm formation was assessed using the coaggregation and<lb/> autoaggregation assays. The architecture of the biofilms was examined under scanning<lb/> electron microscope (SEM). All the strains adhered to the well of the microtiter plate when<lb/> incubated for 48 h, irrespective of the growth medium and incubation temperature. It was<lb/> also noted that 90% and 73% of strains prepared from nutrient broth and cultured in brain<lb/> heart infusion (BHI) broth and tryptic soy broth (TSB), respectively, were able to form<lb/> biofilms, in contrast to 73% and 60% strains from nutrient agar and cultured in BHI and<lb/> TSB respectively grown under similar conditions. However, no statistically significant<lb/> difference was observed when the two methods were compared. The coaggregation index<lb/> ranged from 12% to 74%, with the best coaggregate activity observed when partnered with<lb/> Streptococcus pyogenes (54%-74%). The study indicates the suitability of BHI and TSB<lb/> medium for the cultivation of E. cloacae biofilms, however, temperature and incubation<lb/> time significantly affect biofilm formation by these bacteria.<lb/></div>
