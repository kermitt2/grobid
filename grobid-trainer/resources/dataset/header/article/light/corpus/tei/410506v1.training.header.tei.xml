	(LGS)<lb/> Short title: Temperament, cognition and academic outcomes in childhood Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">There is widespread interest in temperament and its impact upon cognitive and academic<lb/> outcomes. Parents adjust their parenting according to their child&apos;s temperament, however,<lb/> previous studies have not accounted for parenting while estimating the association between<lb/> temperament and academic outcomes. We examined the controlled direct effect of<lb/> temperament (2-3 years) on cognitive and academic outcomes (6-7 years) when mediation by<lb/> parenting practices (4-5 years) was held constant. Participants were from the Longitudinal<lb/> Study of Australian Children (n=5107). Cognitive abilities were measured by the Peabody<lb/> Picture Vocabulary Test (verbal) and the Matrix Reasoning test (non-verbal). Literacy and<lb/> numeracy were reported by teachers using the Academic Rating Scale. Mothers reported<lb/> children&apos;s temperament using the Short Temperament Scale for Toddlers (subscales:<lb/> reactivity, approach, and persistence). Parenting practices included items about engagement<lb/> in activities with children. Marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment<lb/> weights were used to estimate the controlled direct effect of temperament, when setting<lb/> parenting to the mean. All temperament subscales were associated with cognitive abilities,<lb/> with persistence showing the largest controlled direct effect on verbal (β=0.58; 95%CI 0.27,<lb/> 0.89) and non-verbal (β=0.19; 0.02, 0.34) abilities. Higher persistence was associated with<lb/> better literacy (β=0.08; 0.03, 0.13) and numeracy (β=0.08; 0.03, 0.13), and higher reactivity<lb/> with lower literacy (β=-0.08; -0.11, -0.05) and numeracy (β=-0.07; -0.10, -0.04). There was<lb/> little evidence that temperamental approach influenced literacy or numeracy. Overall, there<lb/> was a small controlled direct effect of temperament on cognitive and academic outcomes<lb/> after accounting for parenting and confounders.<lb/></div>
