	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The vertical slot fishways are hydraulic structures that allow the upstream migration of fishes<lb/> through engineering constructions or natural obstructions in rivers. This type of pool fish pass is<lb/> generally very effective in ensuring passage of the target species, particularly diadromous species.<lb/> However, visual observations have shown that certain small species may be trapped in the large<lb/> recirculation zones and seem to have difficulty in rapidly passing through very large pools. An<lb/> experimental study was undertaken to characterize the turbulent flow for various configurations of<lb/> vertical slot fishways and to determine how their characteristics might be modified in order to<lb/> facilitate the passage of small species. The characteristics of mean flow and turbulence were studied<lb/> by PIV and visualizations for several different slopes, flow discharges and pool widths. The results<lb/> showed that the flow pattern always takes one of two topology models depending on the ratio<lb/> length/width of the pool. In order to study the extent to which the dimensions of recirculation zones<lb/> can be reduced, the effect of the insertion of vertical cylinders within the pools was visualized.</div>
