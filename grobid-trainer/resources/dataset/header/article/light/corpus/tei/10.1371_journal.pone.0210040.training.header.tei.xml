	Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Objective<lb/> To investigate trends in the incidence of imported malaria in the UK between 2005 and 2016. Design<lb/> Analysis of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) in The Health Improvement Net-<lb/>work (THIN) primary care database. Setting<lb/> UK primary care Participants<lb/> In total, we examined 12,349,003 individuals aged 0 to 99 years.<lb/> Outcome measure<lb/> The rate of malaria recordings in THIN was calculated per year between 2005 and 2016.<lb/> Rate ratios exploring differences by age, sex, location of general practice, socioeconomic<lb/> status and ethnicity were estimated using multivariable Poisson regression. Results<lb/> A total of 1,474 individuals with a first diagnosis of malaria were identified in THIN between<lb/> 2005 and 2016. The incidence of recorded malaria followed a decreasing trend dropping<lb/> from a rate of 3.33 in 2005 to 1.36 cases per 100,000 person years at risk in 2016. Multivari-<lb/>able Poisson regression showed that adults of working age (20 to 69 years), men, those reg-<lb/>istered with a general practice in London, higher social deprivation and non-white ethnicity<lb/> were associated with higher rates of malaria recordings. Conclusion<lb/> There has been a decrease in the number of malaria recordings in UK primary care over the<lb/> past decade. This decrease exceeds the rate of decline reported in national surveillance<lb/></div>
