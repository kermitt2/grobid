	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background To investigate the effects of collateral coronary circulation on the outcome of the patients with anterior myocardial<lb/> infarction (MI) with left anterior desending artery occlusion abruptly. Methods Data of 189 patients with acute anterior MI who had a<lb/> primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the first 12 h from the onset of symptoms between January 2004 and December 2008<lb/> were retrospective analyzed. Left anterior descending arteries (LAD) of all patients were occluded. LADs were reopened with primary PCI.<lb/> According to the collateral circulation, all patients were classified to two groups: no collateral group (n = 111), patients without angiographic<lb/> collateral filling of LAD or side branches (collateral index 0) and collateral group (n = 78), and patients with angiographic collateral filling of<lb/> LAD or side branches (collateral index 1, 2 or 3). At one year&apos;s follow-up, the occurrence of death, reinfarction, stent thrombosis (ST), target<lb/> vessel revascularization and readmission because of heart failure were observed. Results At one year, the mortality was lower in patients<lb/> with collateral circulation compared with those without collateral circulation (1% vs. 8%, P = 0.049), whereas there were no differences in<lb/> the occurrence of reinfarction, ST, target vessel revascularization and readmission because of heart failure. The occurrence of composite of<lb/> endpoint was lower in patients with collateral circulation compared with those without collateral circulation (12% vs. 26%; P = 0.014).<lb/> Conclusions Pre-exist collateral circulation may prefigure the satisfactory prognosis to the patients with acute anterior MI after primary<lb/> PCI in the first 12 h of MI onset.<lb/></div>
