	Background<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">In vivo cross-reactivity among tropomyosins, major pan-<lb/>allergens among invertebrates, is not established. Our aim<lb/> was to investigate the effects of purified tropomyosins<lb/> from cockroach (recombinant Per a 7) and shrimp (natural<lb/> Lit v 1) on airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness<lb/> in a mouse model of asthma. Methods<lb/> Balb/c mice, 4 to 6 weeks-old, were sensitized twice with<lb/> 50μg of rPer a 7 or nLit v 1 intraperitoneally with 1 mg<lb/> alum, and challenged with 50μg of rPer a 7 or nLit v 1 intra-<lb/>nasally for three days. A group was sensitized with rPer a 7<lb/> and challenged with nLit v 1 under same conditions. Con-<lb/>trols received saline on same days. Twenty-four hours after<lb/> the last challenge, mice were ventilated with FlexiVent ® ,<lb/> and in vivo bronchial hyperresponsiveness was evaluated<lb/> with increased doses of inhaled methacholine (6.25, 12.5,<lb/> 25 and 50mg/ml). After ventilation, bronchoalveolar lavage<lb/> fluid (BALF) was collected and cell counts were performed. Results<lb/> Sensitization and challenge of mice with rPer a 7 or nLit<lb/> v 1 resulted in increase in bronchial hyperresponsive-<lb/>ness, given by increase in total and tissue resistance and<lb/> elastance. Total cells in BALF increased in rPer a 7<lb/> (1×10 5 vs 3×10 5 , p&lt;0.01) and nLit v 1 (1×10 5 vs 1×10 6 ,<lb/> p&lt;0.001) groups, as compared to controls. There was<lb/> increase in macrophages for rPer a 7 (5×10 4 vs 1×10 5 ,<lb/> p&lt;0.001) and nLit v 1 (5×10 4 vs 3×10 5 , p&lt;0.001) and<lb/> eosinophils for rPer a 7 (2×10 3 vs 1.4×10 5 , p&lt;0.001) and<lb/> nLit v 1 (2x10 3 vs 9.1x10 5 , p&lt;0.001). Mice immunized<lb/> with rPer a 7 and challenged with nLit v 1 showed no<lb/> changes in bronchial hyperresponsiveness or eosinophils<lb/> on BALF as compared to controls (2x10 3 vs 6x10 3 ).<lb/> However, there was an increase in neutrophils in this<lb/> group as compared to controls (5x10 4 vs 1x10 5 , p&lt;0.01). Conclusions<lb/> Experimental asthma induced by purified tropomyosins<lb/> from cockroach and shrimp mimicked the main character-<lb/>istics of human asthma. Despite the high degree of<lb/> sequence identity and IgE immunologic cross-reactivity,<lb/> our data suggested that in vivo cross-reactivity of these<lb/> tropomyosins is unlikely.<lb/></div>
