	Abstract: 
	<div type="abstract">Transposable elements (TEs) account for a large portion of the genome in many<lb/> eukaryotic species. Despite their reputation as &quot;junk&quot; DNA or genomic parasites<lb/> deleterious for the host, TEs have complex interactions with host genes and the potential<lb/> to contribute to regulatory variation in gene expression. It has been hypothesized that<lb/> TEs and genes they insert near may be transcriptionally activated in response to stress<lb/> conditions. The maize genome, with many different types of TEs interspersed with<lb/> genes, provides an ideal system to study the genome-wide influence of TEs on gene<lb/> regulation. To analyze the magnitude of the TE effect on gene expression response to<lb/> environmental changes, we profiled gene and TE transcript levels in maize seedlings<lb/> exposed to a number of abiotic stresses. Many genes exhibit up-or down-regulation in<lb/> response to these stress conditions. The analysis of TE families inserted within upstream<lb/> regions of up-regulated genes revealed that between four and nine different TE families<lb/> are associated with up-regulated gene expression in each of these stress conditions,<lb/> affecting up to 20% of the genes up-regulated in response to abiotic stress and as many as<lb/> 33% of genes that are only expressed in response to stress. Expression of many of these<lb/> same TE families also responds to the same stress conditions. The analysis of the stress-<lb/> induced transcripts and proximity of the transposon to the gene suggests that these TEs<lb/> may provide local enhancer activities that stimulate stress-responsive gene expression.<lb/> Our data on allelic variation for insertions of several of these TEs show strong correlation<lb/> between the presence of TE insertions and stress-responsive up-regulation of gene<lb/> expression. Our findings suggest that TEs provide an important source of allelic<lb/> regulatory variation in gene response to abiotic stress in maize.<lb/></div>

	Author summary: <lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Transposable elements are mobile DNA elements that are a prevalent component of many <lb/>eukaryotic genomes. While transposable elements can often have deleterious effects <lb/>through insertions into protein-coding genes they may also contribute to regulatory <lb/>variation of gene expression. There are a handful of examples in which specific <lb/>transposon insertions contribute to regulatory variation of nearby genes, particularly in <lb/>response to environmental stress. We sought to understand the genome-wide influence of <lb/>transposable elements on gene expression responses to abiotic stress in maize, a plant <lb/>with many families of transposable elements located in between genes. Our analysis <lb/>suggests that a small number of maize transposable element families may contribute to <lb/>the response of nearby genes to abiotic stress by providing stress-responsive enhancer-<lb/>like functions. The specific insertions of transposable elements are often polymorphic <lb/>within a species. Our data demonstrate that allelic variation for insertions of the <lb/>transposable elements associated with stress-responsive expression can contribute to <lb/>variation in the regulation of nearby genes. Thus novel insertions of transposable <lb/>elements provide a potential mechanism for genes to acquire cis-regulatory influences <lb/>that could contribute to heritable variation for stress response. <lb/></div>
