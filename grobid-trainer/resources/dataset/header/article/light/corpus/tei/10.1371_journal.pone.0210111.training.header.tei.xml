	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Anxiety and depression can be heightened among individuals living with chronic diseases.<lb/> Identifying these individuals is necessary for ensuring they are provided with adequate support.<lb/> Traditional tools such as clinical interviews or symptom checklists are not always feasible to<lb/> implement in practice. Robust single-item questions may be a useful alternative. This study<lb/> aimed to measure agreement, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative pre-<lb/>dictive value of a single-item question about anxiety and depression compared to the widely<lb/> used Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A cross-sectional survey of 2,811 people<lb/> with cancer attending 19 treatment centres in Australia. Patients were approached in the wait-<lb/>ing room prior to an outpatient clinic appointment and invited to complete a pen and paper sur-<lb/>vey. Participants completed the HADS as well as 2 single-items asking if they have felt anxious<lb/> or depressed in the last week. The single-items for anxiety and depression each demonstrated<lb/> moderate levels of sensitivity (0.78 for anxiety; 0.63 for depression) and specificity (0.75 for<lb/> anxiety; 0.84 for depression) against the relevant HADS subscale. Positive predictive values<lb/> were moderate (0.53 for anxiety and 0.52 for depression) while negative predictive values were<lb/> high for both single-item questions (0.90 for anxiety and 0.89 for depression). The single-item<lb/> measures of anxiety and depression may be useful to rule out individuals who do not require<lb/> further psychological assessment or intervention for anxiety and depression. Further research<lb/> is needed to explore whether these findings generalise to other chronic diseases.<lb/></div>
