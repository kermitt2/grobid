	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND<lb/> Retrograde thrombosis of former feeding arteries should<lb/> be considered as a distinct postoperative complication<lb/> following surgery for arteriovenous malformation (AVM).<lb/> Regardless of the presence of AVMs, the cerebral arteries<lb/> undergo atherosclerotic changes with advancing age. In<lb/> the present study, three cases in elderly patients who<lb/> developed retrograde thrombosis are reported, and the<lb/> effect of the patient&apos;s age on this complication is<lb/> discussed.<lb/> CLINICAL MATERIALS AND METHODS<lb/> The present study group consisted of 158 patients who<lb/> underwent AVM resection and postoperative angio-<lb/>graphic studies. Five patients were 65 years of age or<lb/> older (elderly group) at the time of operation, 108 were<lb/> between 20 and 64 years of age (adult group), and 45 were<lb/> less than 20 years of age (young group). The incidence of<lb/> retrograde thrombosis in the elderly group was com-<lb/>pared with that of the other two groups. RESULTS<lb/> We found that surgery in the elderly group was accom-<lb/>panied by a significantly higher incidence of retrograde<lb/> thrombosis (60%) than in the adult group (4%), or the<lb/> young group (0%). CONCLUSIONS<lb/> The present study suggests that this complication should<lb/> be considered as a serious possibility following removal<lb/> of an AVM, especially in elderly patients.</div>
