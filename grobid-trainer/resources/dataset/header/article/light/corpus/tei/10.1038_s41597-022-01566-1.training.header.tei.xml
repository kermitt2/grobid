	<div type="abstract">Environmental flows are critical for balancing societal water needs with that of riverine ecosystems;<lb/> however, data limitations often hinder the development of predictive relationships between<lb/> anthropogenic modifications to streamflow regimes and ecological responses -these relationships<lb/> are the basis for setting regional water policy standards for rivers. Herein, we present and describe a<lb/> comprehensive dataset of modeled hydrologic alteration and consequences for native fish biodiversity,<lb/> both mapped at the stream-reach resolution for the conterminous U.S. Using empirical observations<lb/> of reference conditions and anthropogenically altered streamflow at over 7000 stream gauges, we<lb/> developed a predictive model of hydrologic alteration, which was extended to &gt;2.6 million stream<lb/> reaches. We then used a previous nationwide assessment of ecological responses to hydrologic<lb/> alteration to predict fish biodiversity loss in stream reaches resulting from streamflow modification.<lb/> Validation efforts suggested hydrologic alteration models had satisfactory performance, whereas<lb/> modeled ecological responses were susceptible to compounded errors. The dataset could ameliorate<lb/> regional data deficits for setting environmental flow standards while providing tools for prioritizing<lb/> streamflow protection or restoration.</div>
