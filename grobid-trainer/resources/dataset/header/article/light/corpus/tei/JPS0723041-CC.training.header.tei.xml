	<div type="abstract">Co NQR studies were performed in recently discovered superconductor NaxCoO2•yH2O to<lb/> investigate physical properties in the superconducting (SC) and normal states. Two samples<lb/> from the same NaxCoO2 were examined, SC bilayer-hydrate sample with Tc ∼ 4.7 K and<lb/> non-SC monolayer-hydrate sample. From the measurement of nuclear-spin lattice relaxation<lb/> rate 1/T1 in the SC sample, it was found that the coherence peak is absent just below Tc and<lb/> that 1/T1 is proportional to temperature far below Tc. These results, which are in qualitatively<lb/> agreement with the previous result by Fujimoto et al., suggest strongly that unconventional<lb/> superconductivity is realized in this compound. In the normal state, 1/T1T of the SC sample<lb/> shows gradual increase below 100K down to Tc, whereas 1/T1T of the non-SC sample shows the<lb/> Korringa behavior in this temperature range. From the comparison between 1/T1T and χ bulk in<lb/> the SC sample, the increase of 1/T1T is attributed to nearly ferromagnetic fluctuations. These<lb/> remarkable findings suggest that the SC sample possesses nearly ferromagnetic fluctuations,<lb/> which are possibly related with the unconventional superconductivity in this compound. The<lb/> implication of this finding is discussed.<lb/></div>
