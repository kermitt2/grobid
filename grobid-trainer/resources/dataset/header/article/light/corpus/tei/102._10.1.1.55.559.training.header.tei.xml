	Abstract.
	<div type="abstract">Maximal word functions occur in data retrieval applications<lb/> and have connections with ranking problems, which in turn were rst<lb/> investigated in relation to data compression 21]. By the \maximal word<lb/> function&quot; of a language L<lb/> , we mean the problem of nding, on<lb/> input x, the lexicographically largest word belonging to L that is smaller<lb/> than or equal to x.<lb/> In this paper we present a parallel algorithm for computing maximal<lb/> word functions for languages recognized by one{way nondeterministic<lb/> auxiliary pushdown automata (and hence for the class of context{free<lb/> languages).<lb/> This paper is a continuation of a stream of research focusing on the<lb/> problem of identifying properties others than membership which are<lb/> easily computable for certain classes of languages. For a survey, see 24].<lb/></div>
