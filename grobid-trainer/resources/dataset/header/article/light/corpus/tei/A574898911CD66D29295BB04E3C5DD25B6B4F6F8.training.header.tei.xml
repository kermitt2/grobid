	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND<lb/> A central retinal artery occlusion is a potentially blinding<lb/> retinal vascular event with no effective treatment regimen<lb/> available. Recently, a few reports have described im-<lb/>proved vision in eyes with central retinal artery occlu-<lb/>sions after selective fibrinolytic therapy followed by long-<lb/>term systemic anticoagulation. Acceptance of this<lb/> treatment, however, has been hampered by a paucity of<lb/> confirmatory reports and its potential for producing se-<lb/>rious hemorrhagic complications. Our report indepen-<lb/>dently confirms the beneficial effects of selective throm-<lb/>bolysis, even with the use of only short-term, post-<lb/>procedure systemic heparinization. METHODS<lb/> A case report of selective fibrinolysis of an occluded<lb/> central retinal artery using urokinase infusion into the<lb/> ophthalmic artery followed with only 12 h of systemic<lb/> heparinization is described. RESULTS<lb/> A 65-year-old man presenting with a central retinal artery<lb/> occlusion of less than 4-h duration enjoyed an improve-<lb/>ment of vision from counting-fingers acuity to 20/20 after<lb/> selective fibrinolysis with urokinase and only 12 h of<lb/> systemic heparinization. No hemorrhagic or thrombotic<lb/> complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS<lb/> Selective thrombolysis with urokinase followed by short-<lb/>term systemic heparinization can effectively treat a cen-<lb/>tral retinal artery occlusion. Whereas the authors ac-<lb/>knowledge that a single case does not prove that short-<lb/>term heparinization is better than long-term<lb/> heparinization, it does show that the latter is not always<lb/> required.</div>
