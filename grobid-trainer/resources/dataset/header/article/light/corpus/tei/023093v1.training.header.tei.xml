	<div type="abstract">Testing for conserved and novel mechanisms underlying phenotypic evolution requires a diversity of 23<lb/> genomes available for comparison spanning multiple independent lineages. For example, complex social 24<lb/> behavior in insects has been investigated primarily with eusocial lineages, nearly all of which are 25<lb/> Hymenoptera. If conserved genomic influences on sociality do exist, we need data from a wider range of taxa 26<lb/> that also vary in their levels of sociality. Here we present information on the genome of the subsocial beetle 27<lb/> Nicrophorus vespilloides, a species long used to investigate evolutionary questions of complex social 28<lb/> behavior. We used this genome to address two questions. First, does life history predict overlap in gene 29<lb/> models more strongly than phylogenetic groupings? Second, like other insects with highly developed social 30<lb/> behavior but unlike other beetles, does N. vespilloides have DNA methylation? We found the overlap in gene 31<lb/> models was similar between N. vespilloides and all other insect groups regardless of life history. Unlike 32<lb/> previous studies of beetles, we found strong evidence of DNA methylation, which allows this species to be 33<lb/> used to address questions about the potential role of methylation in social behavior. The addition of this 34<lb/> genome adds a coleopteran resource to answer questions about the evolution and mechanistic basis of 35<lb/> sociality.</div>
