	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Matings between different Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeast species produce<lb/> sexually sterile hybrids, so individuals should avoid mating with other species. Any mechanism that<lb/> reduces the frequency of interspecific matings will confer a selective advantage. Here we test the<lb/> ability of two closely-related Saccharomyces sensu stricto species to select their own species as<lb/> mates and avoid hybridisation.<lb/> Results: We set up mate choice tests, using five independently isolated pairs of species, in which<lb/> individual germinating spores were presented with the opportunity to mate either with a<lb/> germinating spore of their own species or with a germinating spore of the other species. For all five<lb/> strain pairs, whether a S. cerevisiae or S. paradoxus occupies the role of &quot;chooser&quot; strain, the level<lb/> of hybridisation that is observed between the two species is significantly lower than would be<lb/> expected if mates were selected at random. We also show that, overall, S. cerevisiae exhibited a<lb/> stronger own-species preference than S. paradoxus.<lb/> Conclusion: Prezygotic reproductive isolation is well known in higher organisms but has been<lb/> largely overlooked in yeast, an important model microbe. Here we present the first report of<lb/> prezygotic reproductive isolation in Saccharomyces. Prezygotic reproductive isolation may be<lb/> important in yeast speciation or yeast species cohesion, and may have evolved to prevent wasted<lb/> matings between different species. Whilst yeast has long been used as a genetic model system, little<lb/> is known about yeast in the wild. Our work sheds light on an interesting aspect of yeast natural<lb/> behaviour: their ability to avoid costly interspecific matings.<lb/></div>
