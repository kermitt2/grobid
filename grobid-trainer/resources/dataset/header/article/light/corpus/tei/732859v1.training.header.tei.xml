	<div type="abstract">Background: Computed tomography (CT) images of livers may show a hypo-<lb/>attenuated structure alongside the falciform ligament, which can be a focal fatty<lb/> pseudolesion and can mimic a malignancy. The preferred location is on the right<lb/> parafissural site, ventral in segment IVa/b. The etiology is not clear, nor is it known<lb/> how the histology of this location develops. These are evaluated in this study.<lb/> Methods: 40 adult cadavers with autopsy and / or postmortem CT in a university<lb/> hospital and a forensic center were included. Liver biopsies were taken at the left<lb/> side of the falciform ligament as control, and at the right side as the possible<lb/> precursor of a pseudolesion; these were examined for collagen and fat content. 3<lb/> Cadavers with steatotic (&gt;5% fat) or fibrotic (&gt;2% collagen) control samples were<lb/> excluded.<lb/> Results: Significantly more collagen was present in the right parafissural liver<lb/> parenchyma: median 0.68% (IQR: 0.32 -1.17%), compared to the left side 0.48%<lb/> (IQR: 0.21 -0.75%) (p 0.008), with equal fat content and CT attenuation values. The<lb/> etiophysiology goes back to the demise of the umbilical venes in the early embryonic<lb/> and neonatal period.<lb/> Conclusions: The right parafissural area contains more collagen and an equal<lb/> amount of fat compared to the control left side. This supports the hypothesis of<lb/> delayed, &apos;third&apos; inflow: the postnatal change in blood supply from umbilical to portal<lb/> leaves the downstream parafissural area hypoperfused leading to hypoxia which in<lb/> turn results in collagen accumulation and the persistence of paraumbilical veins of<lb/> Sappey.<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">Key points<lb/> 1. The typical location for a parafissural hepatic pseudolesion contains increased<lb/> collagen.<lb/> 2. A change in histology is caused by physiological demise of the umbilical<lb/> venes. 4<lb/> 3. The suboptimal blood supply of the right parafissural side leads to hypoxia<lb/> and collagen deposition.<lb/> 4. Embryologic knowledge and postmortem histology can help resolve issues in<lb/> radiology.</div>
