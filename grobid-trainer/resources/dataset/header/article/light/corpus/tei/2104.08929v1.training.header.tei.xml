	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">In this paper, we consider non-coherent detection for molecular communication systems in the<lb/> presence of inter-symbol-interference. In particular, we study non-coherent detectors based on memory-<lb/>bits-based thresholds in order to achieve low bit-error-ratio (BER) transmission. The main challenge of<lb/> realizing detectors based on memory-bits-based thresholds is to obtain the channel state information<lb/> based only on the received signals. We tackle this issue by reformulating the thresholds through<lb/> intermediate variables, which can be obtained by clustering multi-dimensional data from the received<lb/> signals, and by using the K-means clustering algorithm. In addition to estimating the thresholds, we<lb/> show that the transmitted bits can be retrieved from the clustered data. To reduce clustering errors, we<lb/> propose iterative clustering methods from one-dimensional to multi-dimensional data, which are shown<lb/> to reduce the BER. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.<lb/></div>
