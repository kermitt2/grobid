	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND: Cost-related underuse of medications<lb/> is common among older adults, who seldom discuss<lb/> medication costs with their physicians. Some older<lb/> adults may use free drug samples or industry-spon-<lb/>sored patient assistance programs (PAP) in hopes of<lb/> lowering out-of-pocket costs, although the long-term<lb/> effect of these programs on drug spending is unclear.<lb/> OBJECTIVE: To examine older adults&apos; use of industry-<lb/>sponsored strategies to reduce out-of-pocket drug<lb/> costs and the association between doctor-patient<lb/> communication and use of these programs.<lb/> DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a 2006 nationally<lb/> representative survey of Medicare beneficiaries.<lb/> PARTICIPANTS: 14,322 community-dwelling Medi-<lb/>care beneficiaries age ≥65.<lb/> MAIN MEASURES: We conducted bivariate and multi-<lb/>variate analyses of the association between receipt of<lb/> free samples and participation in PAPs with socio-<lb/>demographic characteristics, health status, access to<lb/> care, drug coverage, medication cost burden, and<lb/> doctor-patient communication.<lb/> KEY RESULTS: 51.4% of seniors reported receiving at<lb/> least one free sample over the last 12 months and<lb/> 29.2% reported receiving free samples more than once.<lb/> In contrast, only 1.3% of seniors reported participating<lb/> in an industry-sponsored PAP. Higher income respon-<lb/>dents were more likely to report free sample receipt<lb/> than low-income respondents (50.8% vs. 43.8%, p&lt;<lb/> 0.001) and less likely to report participating in a PAP<lb/> (0.42% vs. 2.2%, p&lt;0.001). In multivariate analyses,<lb/> those who reported talking to their doctor about the<lb/> cost of their medications had more than twice the odds<lb/> of receiving samples as those who did not (OR 2.17,<lb/> 95% CI 1.95-2.42).<lb/> CONCLUSIONS: In 2006, over half of seniors in<lb/> Medicare received free samples, but only 1.3%<lb/> reported receiving any medications from a patient<lb/> assistance program. Doctor-patient communication is<lb/> strongly associated with use of these programs, which<lb/> has important implications for clinical care regardless<lb/> of whether these programs are viewed as drivers of<lb/> prescription costs or a remedy for them.<lb/></div>
