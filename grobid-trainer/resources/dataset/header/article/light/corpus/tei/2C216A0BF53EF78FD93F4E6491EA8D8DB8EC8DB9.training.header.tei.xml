	Abstract<lb/>Ž .<lb/> 
	<div type="abstract">The diffusible chemical messenger nitric oxide NO is involved in neuronal plasticity and it is, therefore, supposed to play a role in<lb/> brain development. A shortage of NO during the critical period of brain maturation may theoretically have long-lasting consequences on<lb/> the organization of the adult brain. We have performed in neonatal rats a chronic inhibition of the enzyme responsible for NO production,<lb/> Ž<lb/> .<lb/> nitric oxide synthase NOS , from postnatal day 3 to postnatal day 23, through administration of the competitive antagonist<lb/> Ž<lb/> .<lb/> N-nitro-L-arginine methylester L-NAME . The calcium-dependent catalytic activity resulted almost completely inhibited throughout the<lb/> period of treatment and it took more than 4 days after its suspension to get a full recovery. The expression of the neuronal isoform of the<lb/> Ž<lb/> .<lb/> enzyme nNOS , revealed by immunoblotting, was unchanged during the treatment and after it. The histochemical reaction for NADPH<lb/> diaphorase was reduced at the end of the treatment and recovered in concomitance with the recovery of the catalytic NOS activity. No<lb/> gross structural alterations were detected in brain morphology. The levels of three neurotransmitter-related and one astrocytic marker were<lb/> unchanged in the cerebellum, hippocampus and cortex of 60-day-old rats which had been neonatally treated. A similar lack of significant<lb/> effects on neurochemical brain maturation was also noticed in a parallel series of experiments, in which a short pulse of NOS inhibition<lb/> was performed at a critical prenatal time of brain development, from gestational day 14 to gestational day 19. In vitro, chronic exposure<lb/> Ž<lb/> .<lb/> of cerebellar granule cells to L-NAME 500 mM resulted in slight decrease of surviving neurons after 8 days in culture and in better<lb/> resistance to the challenge of stressful culture conditions. The present results suggest that the basic plan of brain organization can be<lb/> achieved despite an almost complete NOS inhibition during the maturation period. In vitro, NOS inhibition may bring to more<lb/> pronounced consequences on neuronal viability and function.</div>
