	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND<lb/> Retromastoid craniectomy and microvascular decom-<lb/>pression of cranial nerve VII for hemifacial spasm is a well<lb/> accepted and effective treatment. Risks of the operation<lb/> relate to the surgical approach in general and to the<lb/> seventh nerve in particular. Delayed facial weakness is an<lb/> unusual and little-described complication of the proce-<lb/>dure. The purpose of this review is to describe this com-<lb/>plication and the characteristics of the patients so<lb/> affected. METHODS<lb/> Between 1972 and 1996, 985 patients have undergone<lb/> microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm. Dur-<lb/>ing this time, 28 patients (2.8%) undergoing decompres-<lb/>sion of the facial nerve and 1 patient undergoing decom-<lb/>pression of the cochlear nerve for tinnitus developed<lb/> delayed facial palsy. RESULTS<lb/> The weakness was at least a House Grade III or worse and<lb/> was complete in 11 of the patients. The time to occur-<lb/>rence averaged 12 days, with a tight range of 7 to 16 days.<lb/> There were no factors such as duration of symptoms,<lb/> intraoperative findings, or preoperative botulinum injec-<lb/>tions that were predictive of this postoperative weak-<lb/>ness. In all patients there was almost complete recovery<lb/> (House Grade I or II). CONCLUSIONS<lb/> Delayed facial weakness after MVD of CN VII can occur in<lb/> up to 3% of cases. The onset of weakness after operation<lb/> is consistent in its timing, occurring on average 12 days<lb/> after the procedure. Although the etiology of this com-<lb/>plication is uncertain, the palsy spontaneously resolves<lb/> with a good or excellent outcome.</div>
