	<div type="abstract">SET domain protein methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)<lb/> to specific lysine residues of protein substrates, such as the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 and the large subunit of the<lb/> Rubisco holoenzyme complex. The crystal structures of pea Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase (LSMT) in ternary complexes<lb/> with either lysine or ε-N-methyllysine (MeLys) and the product S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) were determined to<lb/> resolutions of 2.65 and 2.55 Å, respectively. The ζ-methyl group of MeLys is bound to the enzyme via carbon-oxygen hydrogen<lb/> bonds that play a key role in catalysis. The methyl donor and acceptor are aligned in a linear geometry for S N 2 nucleophilic<lb/> transfer of the methyl group during catalysis. Differences in hydrogen bonding between the MeLys ε-amino group and Rubisco<lb/> LSMT and SET7/9 explain why Rubisco LSMT generates multiply methylated Lys, wheras SET7/9 generates only MeLys.<lb/></div>
