	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">We modelled the pelagic larval phase of native European oyster (Ostrea edulis) in the Solent.<lb/> The Solent is a complex and tidally energetic environment on the south coast of the UK. Until<lb/> recently it was the largest self-sustaining fishery of the native oyster in Europe. We developed a<lb/> new larval settlement behavioural model that is the simplest plausible model which remains<lb/> consistent with all available data and evidence on larval behaviour. We used a hydrodynamic<lb/> sub-model, a Lagrangian advection sub-model, and an individual agent based model. The results<lb/> demonstrate how isolated oyster assemblages can re-populate larger areas of historical<lb/> inhabitance. We predict the most likely patterns of redistribution from refugia or from fisheries<lb/> seeding. We show that settlement swimming behaviour is as equally important as passive<lb/> hydrodynamic transport for larval survival and adult distribution and that settlement swimming<lb/> behaviour has a profound impact on settlement patterns. The models show that managed<lb/> broodstock refugia have the potential to seed much larger oyster beds in contrast to broad-scale<lb/> seeding. Such refugia have the advantage of maintaining a locally high and mature population<lb/> with potential for reef features and their associated biodiversity. We show that such refugia may<lb/> be best placed in the tidally dynamic and exposed areas rather than on sheltered coastal sites as<lb/> they have been in the past. Our model is insensitive to parameter variation and could be an<lb/> effective and practical management tool in the face of a paucity of field data on larval distribution<lb/> and behaviour.</div>
