	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: With the deployments of Electronic Health Records (EHR), interoperability testing in healthcare is<lb/> becoming crucial. EHR enables access to prior diagnostic information in order to assist in health decisions. It is a<lb/> virtual system that results from the cooperation of several heterogeneous distributed systems. Interoperability<lb/> between peers is therefore essential. Achieving interoperability requires various types of testing. Implementations<lb/> need to be tested using software that simulates communication partners, and that provides test data and test<lb/> plans.<lb/> Results: In this paper we describe a software that is used to test systems that are involved in sharing medical<lb/> images within the EHR. Our software is used as part of the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) testing<lb/> process to test the Cross Enterprise Document Sharing for imaging (XDS-I) integration profile. We describe its<lb/> architecture and functionalities; we also expose the challenges encountered and discuss the elected design<lb/> solutions.<lb/> Conclusions: EHR is being deployed in several countries. The EHR infrastructure will be continuously evolving to<lb/> embrace advances in the information technology domain. Our software is built on a web framework to allow for<lb/> an easy evolution with web technology. The testing software is publicly available; it can be used by system<lb/> implementers to test their implementations. It can also be used by site integrators to verify and test the<lb/> interoperability of systems, or by developers to understand specifications ambiguities, or to resolve<lb/> implementations difficulties.<lb/></div>
