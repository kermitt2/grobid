	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The §kpÊrvsiw, or world&apos;s conflagration, followed by the restoration of an iden-<lb/>tical world seems to go against the rationality of the Stoic god. The aim of this<lb/> paper is to show that Cleanthes, the second head of the School, can avoid this<lb/> paradox. According to Cleanthes, the conflagration is an inevitable side-effect of<lb/> the necessary means used by god to sustain the world. Given that this side-effect<lb/> is contrary to god&apos;s sustaining activity, but unavoidable, god&apos;s rationality requires<lb/> the restoration of an identical world once the conflagration subsides. The paper<lb/> also deals with the relation between Cleanthes and other early Stoics on the topic<lb/> of conflagration. In particular, Cleanthes&apos; position seems to differ from Chrysippus&apos;.<lb/> For in contrast with the Cleanthean god, who causes the conflagration as a side-<lb/>effect only, the Chrysippean god, according to an influential interpretation put<lb/> forward by Jaap Mansfeld, causes the conflagration as his ultimate cosmological<lb/> goal.</div>
