	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Time-resolved OSL curves from quartz are usually measured over a few hundred µs<lb/> because this time range best illustrates the main component in quartz which lies in the<lb/> range of 30-45 µs. In this study we present the decay form of quartz time-resolved<lb/> optically stimulated luminescence (TR-OSL) and optically stimulated<lb/> phosphorescence (OSP) covering over 8 orders of magnitude from 50 ns to~8 s. A<lb/> detailed characterisation of the previously unstudied slowly decaying signals (ms-s<lb/> time scales) is undertaken to understand the origin of these components and the role<lb/> of re-trapping following optical stimulation. We present preheat and stimulation<lb/> temperature dependence for both the TR-OSL and OSP curves in these time ranges<lb/> and use the latter data to determine the E and s values for the participating shallow<lb/> traps. We observe an abnormal decay behaviour seen as a sudden increase in the<lb/> decay rate (a &apos;kink&apos;) conspicuous at about 2 -3 s in the OSP curves measured at 75<lb/> and 100°C. We satisfactorily reproduce this behaviour with a numerically solved<lb/> kinetic model consisting of 4 energy levels. The physical interpretation of the kinetic<lb/> rate equations is discussed in terms a three trap -one centre model or a one trap -two<lb/> centres model involving localised charge transfer.</div>
