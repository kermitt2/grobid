	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND<lb/> Cavernous hemangiomas of the spine and spinal cord are<lb/> relatively uncommon lesions that are being discovered<lb/> more frequently because of the increased use of magnetic<lb/> resonance imaging (MRI). We present a rare case of a<lb/> symptomatic cavernous hemangioma of the cauda equina.<lb/> CASE DESCRIPTION<lb/> A 49-year-old woman presented to our institution with the<lb/> chief complaint of low back pain of acute onset. On phys-<lb/>ical examination the patient was found to be tender to<lb/> percussion over the lumbar spine, had tenderness over<lb/> the sciatic nerve, loss of pinprick sensation over the right<lb/> lateral foot and loss of the Achilles&apos; reflex on the right. In<lb/> addition, she was found to have a large postvoid urinary<lb/> bladder residual volume. MRI revealed a 20 mm ϫ 11 mm<lb/> nonenhancing, heterogenous mass obliterating the spinal<lb/> canal at the L4 level. At operation, this lesion was found<lb/> to be adherent to the nerve roots and was completely<lb/> resected. Pathology revealed this lesion to be a cavern-<lb/>ous angioma of the cauda equina. A review of the perti-<lb/>nent literature is presented. CONCLUSIONS<lb/> Cavernous hemangiomas of the cauda equina are ex-<lb/>tremely rare lesions that may present as low back pain,<lb/> neurologic deficit, or as subarachnoid hemorrhage. They<lb/> can be successfully treated with surgical excision.<lb/></div>
