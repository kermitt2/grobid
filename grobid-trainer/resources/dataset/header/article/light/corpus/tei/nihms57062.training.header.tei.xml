	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">We explored the genetic basis for intraspecific variation in mycoplasmal sialidase activity that<lb/> correlates with virulence, and its potentially advantageous linkage to nutrient catabolism.<lb/> Polymorphism in N-acetylneuraminate scavenging and degradation genes (sialidase, N-<lb/>acetylneuraminate lyase, N-acetylmannosamine kinase, N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate<lb/> epimerase, N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase, and glucosamine-6-phosphate<lb/> deaminase) was evident among eight strains of the avian pathogen Mycoplasma synoviae. Most<lb/> differences were single nucleotide polymorphisms, ranging from 0.34 ± 0.04 substitutions per 100<lb/> bp for N-acetylmannosamine kinase to 0.65 ± 0.03 for the single-copy sialidase gene nanI. Missense<lb/> mutations were twice as common as silent mutations in nanI; 26% resulted in amino acids dissimilar<lb/> to consensus; and there was a 12-base deletion near the nanI promoter in strain WVU1853 T ,<lb/> supporting a complex genetic basis for differences in sialidase activity. Two strains had identical<lb/> frameshifts in the N-acetylneuraminate lyase gene nanA, resulting in nonsense mutations, and both<lb/> had downstream deletions in nanA. Such genetic lesions uncouple extracellular liberation of sialic<lb/> acid from generation of fructose-6-phosphate and pyruvate via intracellular N-acetylneuraminate<lb/> degradation. Retention of nanI by such strains, but not others in the M. synoviae phylogenetic cluster,<lb/> is evidence that sialidase has an important non-nutritional role in the ecology of M. synoviae and<lb/> certain other mycoplasmas.</div>
