	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The principles underlying this report can be summarized as follows:<lb/> 1. A strong theoretical foundation is vital to computer science.<lb/> 2. Theory can be enriched by practice.<lb/> 3. Practice can be enriched by theory.<lb/> 4. If we consider (2) and (3), the value, impact, and funding of theory will be enhanced.<lb/> In order to achieve a greater synergy between theory and application, and to sustain and expand on<lb/> the remarkable successes of Theory of Computing (TOC), we consider it essential to increase the impact<lb/> of theory on key application areas. This requires additional nancial resources in support of theory, and<lb/> closer interaction between theoreticians and researchers in other areas of computer science and in other<lb/> disciplines.<lb/> The report does not make a detailed assessment of the overall state of theoretical computer science<lb/> or fully chronicle the achievements of this eld. Instead, it has the speci c objective of recommending<lb/> ways to harness these remarkable achievements for the solution of challenging problems emerging from<lb/> new developments such as the information superhighway.<lb/> Section 1 describes the events leading up to this report and delineates the report&apos;s objectives. Section<lb/> 2 establishes the context for the report. It traces the history of TOC, describes the impact that TOC has<lb/> achieved in the areas of core theory and fundamental algorithms, points out the di erences between these<lb/> areas and application-oriented theory, and calls for an intensi ed e ort to bring the methods of TOC<lb/> to bear on applications. It then goes on to de ne the four main categories into which our recommen-<lb/>dations fall: building bridges between theory and applications, algorithm engineering, communication,<lb/> and education. Section 3 discusses some speci c opportunities for stimulating interactions between TOC<lb/> and applied areas. Section 4 proposes an applied research initiative, Information Access in a Globally<lb/> Distributed Environment, which identi es an exciting current technological area that we believe presents<lb/> challenging opportunities for excellent theoretical work. Section 5 proposes a second applied research<lb/> initiative, The Algorithmic Stockroom, that would exploit and extend the body of theoretical knowledge<lb/> in the eld of algorithms. Section 6 proposes a broadening in graduate education with two purposes<lb/> in mind: to better prepare theoreticians to interact creatively with practitioners, and to provide future<lb/> practitioners with the background they will need to bene t from this exchange.</div>
