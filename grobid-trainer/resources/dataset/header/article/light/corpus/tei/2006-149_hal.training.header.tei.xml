	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">In the European Union (EU) pyrotechnic articles are subjected to comply with national regulations in<lb/> addition to a series of EU Directives. In order to harmonize regulations in the EU, the placing on the<lb/> market of pyrotechnic articles is going to fall under the scope of a new European Directive. Among these<lb/> articles, one finds pyrotechnic components of automotive safety equipment such as gas generators or<lb/> igniters. In the very fast growing market of automotive safety industry, regulations might be perceived as<lb/> non-technical barriers to innovation in the field. Conversely, through innovation arguments, industries<lb/> sometimes try to promote specific cases of exemptions to comply various regulations.<lb/> In a broad approach, we examine both regulation and industrial recent repercussions in the field of<lb/> pyrotechnic devices for automotive safety, as these points of view face each other too often.<lb/> Considerations regarding design, transport classification, approvals, safety features, environmental issues<lb/> and treatment of end-life waste disposal are provided along the life cycle of the products. We enlighten<lb/> needs in term of harmonized standards and technical procedures to answer regulation requirements. Such<lb/> needs bring new perspectives and make room to various stakeholders for possible and efficient<lb/> developments.</div>
