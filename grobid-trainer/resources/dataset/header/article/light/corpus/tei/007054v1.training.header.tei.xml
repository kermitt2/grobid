	2 ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Mycoplasmas are notorious contaminants of cell culture and can have profound effects on<lb/> host cell biology by depriving cells of nutrients and inducing global changes in gene expression.<lb/> Because they are small, they can escape filtration in culture media. Because they lack cell walls,<lb/> they are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Over the last two decades, sentinel testing has<lb/> revealed wide-ranging contamination rates in mammalian culture. To obtain an unbiased<lb/> assessment from hundreds of labs, we analyzed sequence data from 9395 rodent and primate<lb/> samples from 884 series (or projects) in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. We found 11% of<lb/> these series were contaminated (defined as â‰¥ 100 reads/million mapping to mycoplasma in one<lb/> or more samples). Ninety percent of mycoplasma-mapped reads aligned to ribosomal RNA.<lb/> Interestingly, series using poly(A)-selection, which should bias against mycoplasma detection,<lb/> had comparable contamination rates as non-poly(A)-selected series. We also examined the<lb/> relationship between mycoplasma contamination and host gene expression in a single cell RNA-<lb/>seq dataset and found 61 host genes (P &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with mycoplasma-<lb/>mapped read counts. Lastly, to estimate the potential economic cost of this widespread<lb/> contamination, we queried NIH RePORTER to find grants with the terms &quot;cell culture&quot; or &quot;cell<lb/> lines&quot;. Funding for these totaled over $3 billion, suggesting hundreds of millions of dollars in<lb/> research are potentially affected. In all, this study suggests mycoplasma contamination is still<lb/> prevalent today and poses substantial risk to research quality, with considerable financial<lb/> consequences.</div>
