	<div type="abstract">Ca 2+ spikes initiated in the apical dendrites of layer-5 pyramidal cells (PC) underlie<lb/> nonlinear dynamic changes in the gain of cellular response, which is critical for top-down cognitive<lb/> control. Detailed models with several compartments and dozens of ionic channels have been<lb/> proposed to account for this Ca 2+ spike-dependent gain with its associated critical frequency.<lb/> However, current models do not account for all known Ca 2+ -dependent features. Previous attempts<lb/> to include more features have required increasing complexity, limiting their interpretability and<lb/> utility for studying large population dynamics. We present a minimal 2-compartment biophysical<lb/> model, overcoming these limitations. In our model, a basal-dendritic/somatic compartment<lb/> included typical Na + and K + conductances, while an apical-dendritic/trunk compartment included<lb/> persistent Na + , hyperpolarization-activated cation (Ih), slow inactivation K + , muscarinic K + , and<lb/> Ca 2+ L-type. The model replicated the Ca 2+ spike morphology and its critical frequency plus three<lb/> other defining features of layer-5 PC synaptic integration: linear frequency-current relationships,<lb/> backpropagation-activated Ca 2+ spike firing, and a shift in the critical frequency by blocking Ih.<lb/> Simulating 1,000 synchronized layer-5 PCs, we reproduced the current source density patterns<lb/> evoked by Ca 2+ -spikes both with and without Ih current. Thus, a 2-compartment model with five<lb/> non-classic ionic currents in the apical-dendrites reproduces all features of these neurons. We<lb/> discuss the utility of this minimal model to study the microcircuitry of agranular areas of the frontal<lb/> lobe involved in cognitive control and responsible for event-related potentials such as the error-<lb/>related negativity.<lb/></div>

	Significance Statement<lb/>

	A tractable model of layer-5 pyramidal cells replicates all known features crucial for distal<lb/> synaptic integration in these neurons. This minimal model enables new multi-scale investigations<lb/> of microcircuit functions with associated current flows measured by intracranial local field<lb/> potentials. It thus establishes a foundation for the future computational evaluation of scalp<lb/> electroencephalogram signatures imprinted by Ca 2+ spikes in pyramidal cells, a phenomenon<lb/> underlying many brain cognitive processes.
