	Abstract
	<div type="abstract">A major challenge facing Celtic Fringe agri-food SMEs (in countries and regions of`C<lb/> eltic&apos;&apos; origin such as Wales, Ireland and Brittany) is how to sustain growth in a global market: a<lb/> market that is being expanded via e-commerce through the Internet to an international audience. This<lb/> paper reports on a two-stage survey undertaken by the Welsh Enterprise Institute initially involving a<lb/> short questionnaire that measures current Welsh agri-food SME usage of e-commerce and promotion<lb/> via the Internet. A selected follow up of respondents was undertaken utilising a more in-depth<lb/> questionnaire study of the management implications and critical success factors of those enterprises<lb/> using the Internet. The paper concludes by arguing the need for appropriate support to be provided<lb/> for Celtic Fringe, and specifically Welsh, agri-food SMEs to make them aware of the importance of<lb/> the adoption of e-commerce as a critical success factor for their marketing in the twenty-first century.<lb/></div>
