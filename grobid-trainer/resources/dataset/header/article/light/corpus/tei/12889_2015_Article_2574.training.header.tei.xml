	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: The global disease burden resulting from climate change is likely to be substantial and will<lb/> put further strain on public health systems that are already struggling to cope with demand. An up-stream<lb/> solution, that of preventing climate change and associated adverse health effects, is a promising approach,<lb/> which would create win-win-situations where both the environment and human health benefit. One such<lb/> solution would be to apply methods of behaviour change to prompt pro-environmentalism, which in turn<lb/> benefits health and wellbeing.<lb/> Discussion: Based on evidence from the behavioural sciences, we suggest that, like many social behaviours,<lb/> pro-environmental behaviour can be automatically induced by internal or external stimuli. A potential trigger<lb/> for such automatic pro-environmental behaviour would be natural environments themselves.<lb/> Previous research has demonstrated that natural environments evoke specific psychological and physiological<lb/> reactions, as demonstrated by self-reports, epidemiological studies, brain imaging techniques, and various<lb/> biomarkers. This suggests that exposure to natural environments could have automatic behavioural effects,<lb/> potentially in a pro-environmental direction, mediated by physiological reactions.<lb/> Providing access and fostering exposure to natural environments could then serve as a public health tool, together with<lb/> other measures, by mitigating climate change and achieving sustainable health in sustainable ecosystems. However,<lb/> before such actions are implemented basic research is required to elucidate the mechanisms involved, and applied<lb/> investigations are needed to explore real world impacts and effect magnitudes. As environmental research is still not<lb/> sufficiently integrated within medical or public health studies there is an urgent need to promote interdisciplinary<lb/> methods and investigations in this critical field.<lb/> Summary: Health risks posed by anthropogenic climate change are large, unevenly distributed, and unpredictable.<lb/> To ameliorate negative impacts, pro-environmental behaviours should be fostered. Potentially this could be achieved<lb/> automatically through exposure to favourable natural environments, with an opportunity for cost-efficient nature-based<lb/> solutions that provide benefits for both the environment and public health.<lb/></div>
