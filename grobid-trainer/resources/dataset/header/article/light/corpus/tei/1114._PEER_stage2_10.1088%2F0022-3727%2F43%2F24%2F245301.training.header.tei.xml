	*Corresponding Author Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Reflection anisotropy spectra (RAS) of transparent elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) have<lb/> been determined over the spectral range 1.5 eV to 5.0 eV for a range of tensile loads. Using a slight<lb/> wedge shaped sample the spectra from the incident air/PDMS surface are shown to be weak and<lb/> largely featureless at all loads. By contrast the spectra from the light transmitted through the sample<lb/> and reflected at the other interface are large in magnitude and exhibit features which arise from the<lb/> small stress birefringence of PDMS.<lb/> The birefringent dominated spectra can readily be simulated using expressions derived from a<lb/> Stokes-Mueller treatment of the optical system and this enabled the stress-optical coefficient to be<lb/> determined at any energy within the spectral range covered. It is shown that there is a small angle<lb/> between the optical axes and the mechanical axes in the sample and that this is consistent with the<lb/> model of an elastomer which comprises a network of soft linear chains cross linked with stiff bridges.</div>
