	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">According to space-based theory, visual attention is limited to a local region in space called the<lb/> attentional field. Visual information within the attentional field is enhanced for further processing<lb/> while information outside is suppressed. There is evidence that enhancement and suppression are<lb/> achieved with dynamic weighting of network activity. This paper discusses a neural network that<lb/> generates the appropriate weights, called the otfentional spotlight, given the size and the position of<lb/> the intended attentional field. The network has three layers. A hmtingfeedback network serves as the<lb/> output layer and performs a critical task whirh cannot be accomplished by feedforward networks.<lb/></div>
