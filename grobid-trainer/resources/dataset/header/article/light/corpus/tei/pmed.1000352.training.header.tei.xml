	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Pharmaceutical companies spent $57.5 billion on pharmaceutical promotion in the United States in 2004. The<lb/> industry claims that promotion provides scientific and educational information to physicians. While some evidence indicates<lb/> that promotion may adversely influence prescribing, physicians hold a wide range of views about pharmaceutical<lb/> promotion. The objective of this review is to examine the relationship between exposure to information from<lb/> pharmaceutical companies and the quality, quantity, and cost of physicians&apos; prescribing.<lb/> Methods and Findings: We searched for studies of physicians with prescribing rights who were exposed to information from<lb/> pharmaceutical companies (promotional or otherwise). Exposures included pharmaceutical sales representative visits, journal<lb/> advertisements, attendance at pharmaceutical sponsored meetings, mailed information, prescribing software, and participation<lb/> in sponsored clinical trials. The outcomes measured were quality, quantity, and cost of physicians&apos; prescribing. We searched<lb/></div>

	Medline (1966 to February 2008), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to February 2008), Embase (1997 to February<lb/> 2008), Current Contents (2001 to 2008), and Central (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007)

	<div type="abstract"> using the search terms developed with<lb/> an expert librarian. Additionally, we reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and pharmaceutical companies for<lb/> information. Randomized and observational studies evaluating information from pharmaceutical companies and measures of<lb/> physicians&apos; prescribing were independently appraised for methodological quality by two authors. Studies were excluded where<lb/> insufficient study information precluded appraisal. The full text of 255 articles was retrieved from electronic databases (7,185<lb/> studies) and other sources (138 studies). Articles were then excluded because they did not fulfil inclusion criteria (179) or quality<lb/> appraisal criteria (18), leaving 58 included studies with 87 distinct analyses. Data were extracted independently by two authors<lb/> and a narrative synthesis performed following the MOOSE guidelines. Of the set of studies examining prescribing quality<lb/> outcomes, five found associations between exposure to pharmaceutical company information and lower quality prescribing,<lb/> four did not detect an association, and one found associations with lower and higher quality prescribing. 38 included studies<lb/> found associations between exposure and higher frequency of prescribing and 13 did not detect an association. Five included<lb/> studies found evidence for association with higher costs, four found no association, and one found an association with lower<lb/> costs. The narrative synthesis finding of variable results was supported by a meta-analysis of studies of prescribing frequency<lb/> that found significant heterogeneity. The observational nature of most included studies is the main limitation of this review.<lb/> Conclusions: With rare exceptions, studies of exposure to information provided directly by pharmaceutical companies have<lb/> found associations with higher prescribing frequency, higher costs, or lower prescribing quality or have not found<lb/> significant associations. We did not find evidence of net improvements in prescribing, but the available literature does not<lb/> exclude the possibility that prescribing may sometimes be improved. Still, we recommend that practitioners follow the<lb/> precautionary principle and thus avoid exposure to information from pharmaceutical companies.<lb/></div>
