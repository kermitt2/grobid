	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Many studies have shown that cyclic adenosine-59-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and G-<lb/>protein-coupled receptor 3 (GPR3) are crucial for controlling meiotic arrest in oocytes. However, it is unclear how<lb/> gonadotropins modulate these factors to regulate oocyte maturation, especially by gap junctional communication (GJC).<lb/> Using an in vitro meiosis-arrested mouse cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) culture model, we showed that there is a close<lb/> relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and the PKA type I (PKAI) and GPR3. The effect of FSH on oocyte<lb/> maturation was biphasic, initially inhibitory and then stimulatory. During FSH-induced maturation, rapid cAMP surges were<lb/> observed in both cumulus cells and oocyte. Most GJC between cumulus cells and oocyte ceased immediately after FSH<lb/> stimulation and recommenced after the cAMP surge. FSH-induced maturation was blocked by PKAI activator 8-AHA-cAMP.<lb/> Levels of PKAI regulatory subunits and GPR3 decreased and increased, respectively, after FSH stimulation. In the presence of<lb/> the GJC inhibitor carbenoxolone (CBX), FSH failed to induce the meiotic resumption and the changes in PKAI, GPR3 and<lb/> cAMP surge in oocyte were no longer detected. Furthermore, GPR3 was upregulated by high cAMP levels, but not by PKAI<lb/> activation. When applied after FSH stimulation, the specific phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) inhibitor cilostamide<lb/> immediately blocked meiotic induction, regardless of when it was administered. PKAI activation inhibited mitogen-<lb/>activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in the oocytes of COCs, which participated in the initiation of FSH-induced<lb/> meiotic maturation in vitro. Just before FSH-induced meiotic maturation, cAMP, PKAI, and GPR3 returned to basal levels, and<lb/> PDE3A activity and MAPK phosphorylation increased markedly. These experiments show that FSH induces a transient<lb/> increase in cAMP levels and regulates GJC to control PKAI and GPR3 activities, thereby creating an inhibitory phase. After<lb/> PDE3A and MAPK activities increase, meiosis resumes.<lb/></div>
