	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder are among<lb/> relatively prevalent disorders during childhood and adolescence.<lb/> Considering the negative impact of the parents&apos; drug dependency and<lb/> bipolar disorder, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of<lb/> ADHD and conduct disorder in children of drug-dependent and bipolar<lb/> parents.<lb/> Background:<lb/> In this case-control study, the case group included two groups of<lb/> patients with drug dependency and bipolar disorder hospitalized in<lb/> Shahid Beheshti hospital in Kerman who had 7 to 11-year-old children.<lb/> The control group included healthy individuals without any drug<lb/> dependency or other psychiatric disorders. Data were collected using<lb/> Rutter scale Form A (parents&apos; form) and a demographic questionnaire.<lb/> Data were analyzed with ANOVA, Chi-square and Tamhane&apos;s post-hoc<lb/> test.<lb/> Methods:<lb/> Rutter&apos;s abnormal scores were generally 7.11% in children of drug<lb/> dependent parents, 14% in children of bipolar parents and 1.6% in children<lb/> of healthy parents demonstrating no significant difference. The frequency<lb/> of conduct disorder in the bipolar and drug dependent group was higher<lb/> than the healthy group, but the difference was not significant. The<lb/> frequency of ADHD was 8.9% in the drug dependency group and 1% in<lb/> the control group which shows a significant difference.<lb/> Findings:<lb/> Drug dependency in parents may be a leading factor to mental<lb/> disorders such as ADHD and conduct disorder in children.<lb/> Conclusion:<lb/></div>
