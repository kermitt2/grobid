	<div type="abstract">Background: Ring chromosomes are normally associated with developmental anomalies and are<lb/> rarely inherited. An exception to this rule is provided by deletion/ring cases. We were provided<lb/> with a unique opportunity to investigate the meiotic segregation at oogenesis in a woman who is a<lb/> carrier of a deleted/ring 22 chromosome. The couple requested preimplantation genetic diagnosis<lb/> (PGD) following the birth of a son with a mosaic karyotype.<lb/> The couple underwent two cycles of PGD. Studies were performed on lymphocytes, single<lb/> embryonic cells removed from 3 day-old embryos and un-transferred embryos. Analysis was<lb/> carried out using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with specific probe sets in two rounds<lb/> of hybridization.<lb/> Results: In total, 12 embryos were biopsied, and follow up information was obtained for 10<lb/> embryos. No embryos were completely normal or balanced for chromosome 22 by day 5. There<lb/> was only one embryo diagnosed as balanced of 12 biopsied but that accumulated postzygotic errors<lb/> by day 5. Three oocytes apparently had a balanced chromosome 22 complement but all had the<lb/> deleted and the ring 22 and not the intact chromosome 22. After fertilisation all the embryos<lb/> accumulated postzygotic errors for chromosome 22.<lb/> Conclusion: The study of the preimplantation embryos in this case provided a rare and significant<lb/> chance to study and understand the phenomena associated with this unusual type of anomaly during<lb/> meiosis and in the earliest stages of development. It is the first reported PGD attempt for a ring<lb/> chromosome abnormality.<lb/></div>
