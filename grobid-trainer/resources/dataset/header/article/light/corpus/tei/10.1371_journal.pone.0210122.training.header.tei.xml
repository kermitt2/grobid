	(AMS) Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Background<lb/> Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the primary vectors that transmit several arboviral dis-<lb/>eases, including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The world is presently experiencing a<lb/> series of outbreaks of these diseases, so, we still require to better understand the current<lb/> distributions and possible future shifts of their vectors for successful surveillance and control<lb/> programs. Few studies assessed the influences of climate change on the spatial distribu-<lb/>tional patterns and abundance of these important vectors, particularly using the most recent<lb/> climatic scenarios. Here, we updated the current potential distributions of both vectors and<lb/> assessed their distributional changes under future climate conditions. Methods<lb/> We used ecological niche modeling approach to estimate the potential distributions of Ae.<lb/> aegypti and Ae. albopictus under present-day and future climate conditions. This approach<lb/> fits ecological niche model from occurrence records of each species and environmental vari-<lb/>ables. For each species, future projections were based on climatic data from 9 general circu-<lb/>lation models (GCMs) for each representative concentration pathway (RCP) in each time<lb/> period, with a total of 72 combinations in four RCPs in 2050 and 2070. All ENMs were tested<lb/> using the partial receiver operating characteristic (pROC) and a set of 2,048 and 2,003 addi-<lb/>tional independent records for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively. Finally, we used<lb/> background similarity test to assess the similarity between the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and Ae.<lb/> albopictus. Results<lb/> The predicted potential distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus coincided with the cur-<lb/>rent and historical known distributions of both species. Aedes aegypti showed a markedly<lb/> broader distributional potential across tropical and subtropical regions than Ae. albopictus.<lb/> Interestingly, Ae. albopictus was markedly broader in distributional potential across<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">temperate Europe and the United States. All ecological niche models (ENMs) were statisti-<lb/>cally robust (P &lt; 0.001). ENMs successfully anticipated 98% (1,999/2,048) and 99% (1,985/<lb/> 2,003) of additional independent records for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respec-<lb/>tively (P &lt; 0.001). ENMs based on future conditions showed similarity between the overall<lb/> distributional patterns of future-day and present-day conditions; however, there was a north-<lb/>ern range expansion in the continental USA to include parts of Southern Canada in case of<lb/> Ae. albopictus in both 2050 and 2070. Future models also anticipated further expansion of<lb/> Ae. albopictus to the East to include most of Europe in both time periods. Aedes aegypti<lb/> was anticipated to expand to the South in East Australia in 2050 and 2070. The predictions<lb/> showed differences in distributional potential of both species between diverse RCPs in 2050<lb/> and 2070. Finally, the background similarity test comparing the ENMs of Ae. aegypti and<lb/> Ae. albopictus was unable to reject the null hypothesis of niche similarity between both spe-<lb/>cies (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion<lb/> These updated maps provided details to better guide surveillance and control programs of<lb/> Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. They have also significant public health importance as a<lb/> baseline for predicting the emergence of arboviral diseases transmitted by both vectors in<lb/> new areas across the world.</div>
