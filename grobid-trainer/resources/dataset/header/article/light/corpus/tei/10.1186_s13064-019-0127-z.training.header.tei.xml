	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: During development, gustatory (taste) neurons likely undergo numerous changes in morphology and<lb/> expression prior to differentiation into maturity, but little is known this process or the factors that regulate it. Neuron<lb/> differentiation is likely regulated by a combination of transcription and growth factors. Embryonically, most geniculate<lb/> neuron development is regulated by the growth factor brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Postnatally, however,<lb/> BDNF expression becomes restricted to subpopulations of taste receptor cells with specific functions. We hypothesized<lb/> that during development, the receptor for BDNF, tropomyosin kinase B receptor (TrkB), may also become developmentally<lb/> restricted to a subset of taste neurons and could be one factor that is differentially expressed across taste neuron subsets.<lb/> Methods: We used transgenic mouse models to label both geniculate neurons innervating the oral cavity (Phox2b+),<lb/> which are primarily taste, from those projecting to the outer ear (auricular neurons) to label TrkB expressing neurons<lb/> (TrkB GFP ). We also compared neuron number, taste bud number, and taste receptor cell types in wild-type animals and<lb/> conditional TrkB knockouts.<lb/> Results: Between E15.5-E17.5, TrkB receptor expression becomes restricted to half of the Phox2b + neurons. This TrkB<lb/> downregulation was specific to oral cavity projecting neurons, since TrkB expression remained constant throughout<lb/> development in the auricular geniculate neurons (Phox2b-). Conditional TrkB removal from oral sensory neurons (Phox2b+)<lb/> reduced this population to 92% of control levels, indicating that only 8% of these neurons do not depend on TrkB for<lb/> survival during development. The remaining neurons failed to innervate any remaining taste buds, 14% of which remained<lb/> despite the complete loss of innervation. Finally, some types of taste receptor cells (Car4+) were more dependent on<lb/> innervation than others (PLCβ2+).<lb/> Conclusions: Together, these findings indicate that TrkB expression and dependence divides gustatory neurons into three<lb/> subpopulations: 1) neurons that always express TrkB and are TrkB-dependent during development (50%), 2) neurons<lb/> dependent on TrkB during development but that downregulate TrkB expression between E15.5 and E17.5 (41%), and 3)<lb/> neurons that never express or depend on TrkB (9%). These TrkB-independent neurons are likely non-gustatory, as they do<lb/> not innervate taste buds.<lb/></div>
