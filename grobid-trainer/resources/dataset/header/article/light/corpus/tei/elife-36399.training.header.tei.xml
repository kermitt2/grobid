	<titlePart>Gender inequalities among<lb/> authors who contributed equally<lb/> </titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	Abstract 
	<div type="abstract">We analyzed 2898 scientific papers published between 1995 and 2017 in which two or more authors<lb/> shared the first author position. For papers in which the first and second authors made equal contributions, mixed-<lb/>gender combinations were most frequent, followed by male-male and then female-female author combinations.<lb/> For mixed-gender combinations, more male authors were in the first position, although the disparity decreased<lb/> over time. For papers in which three or more authors made equal contributions, there were more male authors<lb/> than female authors in the first position and more all-male than all-female author combinations. The gender<lb/> inequalities observed among authors who made equal contributions are not consistent with random or<lb/> alphabetical ordering of authors. These results raise concerns about female authors not receiving proper credit for<lb/> publications and suggest a need for journals to request clarity on the method used to decide author order among<lb/> those who contributed equally.<lb/></div>
