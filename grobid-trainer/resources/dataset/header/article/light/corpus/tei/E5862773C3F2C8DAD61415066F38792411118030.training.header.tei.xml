	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Objectives. To determine whether there are indications for and benefits from electron microscopy (EM) of<lb/> sperm during the era of assisted reproductive technology.<lb/> Methods. The medical history, semen analyses, and EM findings of 55 patients with pure male-factor<lb/> infertility were reviewed to determine: (1) which semen characteristics (seminal volume, sperm concentra-<lb/>tion, percent motility, and percent normal morphology) were associated with normal or abnormal ultrastruc-<lb/>ture as determined by EM, (2) whether EM findings correlated with success or failure of in vitro fertilization<lb/> (IVF), and (3) whether EM could screen for potentially inheritable genetic disorders.<lb/> Results. Principal EM diagnoses were normal sperm ultrastructure (11 of 55; 20%), tail abnormalities (21<lb/> of 55; 38%), necrospermia (12 of 55; 22%), acrosomal defects (9 of 55; 16%), neck abnormalities (1 of 55;<lb/> 2%), and incomplete maturation (1 of 55; 2%). Every patient with an abnormal EM study had impaired<lb/> motility (33% or below) and abnormal morphology (13% or lower normal forms by World Health Organiza-<lb/>tion criteria). The percentage of normal sperm morphology differed significantly across EM diagnoses (P Ͻ<lb/> 0.0001). Differences in motility across the groups could not be detected because EM was only performed on<lb/> patients with impaired motility. Although the partner of 1 patient with a normal EM study who underwent IVF<lb/> achieved pregnancy, 11 with abnormal EM studies failed to establish a pregnancy by IVF. Finally, 5 (11%) of<lb/> 44 patients with abnormal EM findings were diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia directly as a result of<lb/> EM. In addition, 3 (6.8%) of the 44 patients with abnormal EM findings were diagnosed with complete<lb/> acrosomal loss.<lb/> Conclusions. Patients with severely abnormal motility and morphology on routine semen analysis may<lb/> benefit from EM study of sperm. Our data indicate that EM findings correlate with success or failure of IVF,<lb/> and that EM can screen for potentially inheritable genetic disorders.</div>
