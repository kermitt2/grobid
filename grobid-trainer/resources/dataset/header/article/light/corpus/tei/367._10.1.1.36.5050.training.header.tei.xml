	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Object recognition, which involves the classi cation of objects into one of many a pri-<lb/>ori known object types, and determining object characteristics such as pose, is a di cult<lb/> problem. A wide range of approaches have been proposed and applied to this problem with<lb/> limited success. This paper presents a brief comparative study of methods from three dif-<lb/>ferent paradigms for object recognition: Bayesian, Neural Network and Expert Systems.<lb/></div>
