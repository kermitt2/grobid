	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Endurance athletes are advised to optimize nutrition prior to races. Little is known about actual<lb/> athletes&apos; beliefs, knowledge and nutritional behaviour. We monitored nutritional behaviour of amateur<lb/> ski-mountaineering athletes during 4 days prior to a major competition to compare it with official recommendations<lb/> and with the athletes&apos; beliefs.<lb/> Methods: Participants to the two routes of the &apos;Patrouille des Glaciers&apos; were recruited (A, 26 km, ascent 1881 m,<lb/> descent 2341 m, max altitude 3160 m; Z, 53 km, ascent 3994 m, descent 4090 m, max altitude 3650 m). Dietary intake<lb/> diaries of 40 athletes (21 A, 19 Z) were analysed for energy, carbohydrate, fat, protein and liquid; ten were interviewed<lb/> about their pre-race nutritional beliefs and behaviour.<lb/> Results: Despite belief that pre-race carbohydrate, energy and fluid intake should be increased, energy consumption<lb/> was 2416 ± 696 (mean ± SD) kcal • day −1 , 83 ± 17 % of recommended intake, carbohydrate intake was only 46 ± 13 % of<lb/> minimal recommended (10 g • kg −1 • day −1 ) and fluid intake only 2.7 ± 1.0 l • day −1 .<lb/> Conclusions: Our sample of endurance athletes did not comply with pre-race nutritional recommendations despite<lb/> elementary knowledge and belief to be compliant. In these athletes a clear and reflective nutritional strategy was<lb/> lacking. This suggests a potential for improving knowledge and compliance with recommendations. Alternatively,<lb/> some recommendations may be unrealistic.<lb/></div>
