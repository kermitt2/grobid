	SUMMARY<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The composition of algal periphyton was examined on eleven species of submerged<lb/> macrophytes collected at a depth of 0.25 m in Sewell Lake, southwestern Manitoba, a shallow<lb/> nitrogen and phosphorus rich lake. There were substantial differences in the periphyton on<lb/> atl macrophyte species. Diatom subcommunities were the most similar, while the green algal<lb/> subcommunities were the most dissimilar on different plant hosts. Potamogeton<lb/> zosteriformis differed the most from all other macrophytes with respect to the composition of<lb/> its periphyton. These results and a comparison of the literature suggest that the composition<lb/> and structure of periphyton communities on living substrates is a product of the interaction<lb/> of many variables, determined by the characteristics of the host plant, the external<lb/> environment and the algae themselves. Studies of periphyton at a given site must take into<lb/> account the various substrates available.<lb/></div>
