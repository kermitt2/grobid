	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">A diet habit, which is developed in childhood, lasts for a life time. In this sense, nutrition education and early exposure to healthy menus in<lb/> childhood is important. Children these days have easy access to the internet. Thus, a web-based nutrition education program for children is an<lb/> effective tool for nutrition education of children. This site provides the material of the nutrition education for children with characters which are<lb/> personified nutrients. The 151 menus are stored in the site together with video script of the cooking process. The menus are classified by the<lb/> criteria based on age, menu type and the ethnic origin of the menu. The site provides a search function. There are three kinds of search conditions<lb/> which are key words, menu type and &quot;between&quot; expression of nutrients such as calorie and other nutrients. The site is developed with the operating<lb/> system Windows 2003 Server, the web server ZEUS 5, development language JSP, and database management system Oracle 10 g.<lb/></div>
