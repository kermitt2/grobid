	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">We have quantitatively measured gene expression for the sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters 1<lb/> and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2) in 23 human tissues using the method of real time PCR. As predicted, our results revealed that the<lb/> expression of SGLT1 was very high in the small intestine (1.2E þ 6 molecules/mg total RNA) relative to that in the kidney<lb/> (3E þ 4 molecules/mg total RNA). Surprisingly, we observed that the expression of SGLT1 in human heart was<lb/> unexpectedly high (3.4E þ 5 molecules/mg total RNA), approximately 10-fold higher than that observed in kidney tissue.<lb/> DNA sequencing confirmed that the PCR amplified fragment was indeed the human SGLT1 gene. Moreover, in situ<lb/> hybridization studies using a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled antisense cRNA probe corresponding to human SGLT1 cDNA<lb/> confirm that human cardiomyocytes express SGLT1 mRNA. In contrast, the expression of SGLT2 in human tissues appears<lb/> to be ubiquitous, with levels ranging from 6.7E þ 4 molecules/mg total RNA (in skeletal muscle) to 3.2E þ 6 molecules/mg<lb/> total RNA (in kidney), levels 10-100-fold higher than the expression of SGLT1 in the same tissues. Our finding that human<lb/> cardiomyocytes express high levels of SGLT1 RNA suggests that SGLT1 may have a functional role in cardiac glucose<lb/> transport. Since several SGLT inhibitors are currently in development as potential anti-diabetic agents, it may be important<lb/> to assess the functional consequences of inhibition of SGLT1 in the heart.</div>
