	<div type="abstract">Background. Inflammatory biomarkers have shown consistent associations with disability and frailty in older adults.<lb/> Statin medications may reduce the incidence the frailty because of their anti-inflammatory effects. This study examines<lb/> associations between current use, duration, and potency of statin medications and incident frailty in initially nonfrail<lb/> women 65 years old or older.<lb/> Methods. The authors conducted a prospective analysis of data from the Women&apos;s Health Initiative Observational<lb/> Study (WHI-OS) conducted at 40 clinical centers in the United States. Eligible women were nonfrail and 65-79 years old<lb/> at baseline (n ¼ 25,378). Current statin use at baseline was ascertained through direct inspection of medicine containers<lb/> during clinic visits. Frailty was ascertained through self-reported indicators and physical measurements at baseline and<lb/> 3-year clinic contacts. Components of frailty included self-reported low physical function, exhaustion, low physical<lb/> activity, and unintended weight loss. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to adjust for covariates predicting<lb/> incident frailty.<lb/> Results. Among the 25,378 eligible women, 3453 (13.6%) developed frailty by the 3-year follow-up contact. Current<lb/> statin use had no association with incident frailty (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio [OR] ¼ 1.00; 95% confidence interval<lb/> [CI], 0.85-1.16). Duration and potency of statin use were also not significantly associated with incident frailty. Among<lb/> low potency statin users, longer duration of use was associated with reduced risk of frailty ( p for trend ¼ .02). A similar<lb/> pattern of results was observed when frailty was studied in the absence of intervening, incident cardiovascular events.<lb/> Conclusions. Overall, incidence of frailty was similar in current statin users and nonusers.<lb/></div>
