	<div type="abstract">The focus of this study was<lb/> on the ability of infants to perceive whether an object is positioned at a distance that would<lb/> make contact possible. As a toy was presented, sometimes within and sometimes beyond reach,<lb/> the initiation of reaching and leaning forward was scored. Infants were divided into leaning and<lb/> nonleaning groups. Both leaning and nonleaning 5-month-olds changed their behavior dramati-<lb/>cally when the object was placed beyond, as opposed to within, reach. The nonleaners showed<lb/> a decline in reaching when this boundary for contact was crossed. The &quot;leaners&quot; did not; rather,<lb/> they began to lean forward. These results suggest that 5-month-olds use information for the<lb/> affordance of contact. 4-month-olds provided less evidence that arm length regulates reaching.<lb/> 5-month-old infants acted as if they not only had some sensitivity to the absolute distance of an<lb/> object but also to the effect that leaning forward has on their ability to make contact with a distant<lb/> object.<lb/></div>
