	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND<lb/> We have used epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for<lb/> pain control for the past 15 years. An analysis of our<lb/> series of 235 patients has clarified the value of specific<lb/> prognostic parameters in the prediction of successful<lb/> SCS. METHODS<lb/> Patients were followed up for periods ranging from 6<lb/> months to 15 years with a mean follow-up of 66 months.<lb/> The mean age of the 150 men and 85 women in the study<lb/> was 51.4 years. Indications for SCS included failed back<lb/> syndrome (114 patients), peripheral vascular disease (39<lb/> patients), peripheral neuropathy (30 patients), multiple<lb/> sclerosis (13 patients), reflex sympathetic dystrophy (13<lb/> patients), and other etiologies of chronic intractable pain<lb/> (26 patients). RESULTS<lb/> One hundred and eighty-nine patients received perma-<lb/>nent devices; 111 (59%) of these patients continue to<lb/> receive satisfactory pain relief. Pain attributable to failed<lb/> back syndrome, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, peripheral<lb/> vascular disease of lower limbs, multiple sclerosis, and<lb/> peripheral neuropathy responded favorably to spinal<lb/> cord stimulation. In contrast, paraplegic pain, cauda<lb/> equina syndrome, stump pain, phantom limb pain, and<lb/> primary bone and joint disease pain did not respond as<lb/> well. Cases of cauda equina injury had promising initial<lb/> pain relief, but gradually declined after a few years. After<lb/> long-term follow-up, 47 of the 111 successfully implanted<lb/> patients were gainfully employed, compared with 22 pa-<lb/>tients before implantation. The successful patients re-<lb/>ported improvements in daily living as well as a decrease<lb/> in analgesic usage. Multipolar stimulation systems were<lb/> significantly more reliable (p Ͻ 0.001) than unipolar sys-<lb/>tems. Complications included hardware malfunction,<lb/> electrode displacement, infection, and tolerance. CONCLUSION<lb/> Aside from etiologies of pain syndromes as a prognostic<lb/> factor, we have identified other parameters of success. In<lb/> patients who have undergone previous surgical proce-<lb/>dures, the shorter the duration of time to implantation,<lb/> the greater the rate of success (p Ͻ 0.001). The diagnosis<lb/> of failed back syndrome must be considered a confound-<lb/>ing factor in our analysis. Those patients whose pain did<lb/> not follow a surgical procedure had better responses to<lb/> SCS than patients who had multiple surgical procedures<lb/> prior to their first implant. The advent of multipolar sys-<lb/>tems has significantly improved clinical reliability over<lb/> unipolar systems. Age, sex, and laterality of pain did not<lb/> prove to be of significance.</div>
