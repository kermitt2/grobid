	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The objective of this study was to characterize the normal microbiome of healthy canine<lb/> vagina and endometrium and to determine the effect of the stage of estrous, on the resident<lb/> microbiome. Cranial vaginal swabs and uterine biopsy samples were collected from twenty-<lb/>five bitches in five different stages of estrous at elective ovariohysterectomy (OVH). Over 4<lb/> million reads of the V4 region of 16S rDNA gene were obtained and used for further analy-<lb/>ses. A total of 317 genera belonging to 24 known phyla were identified. The endometrium<lb/> was higher in bacterial diversity while the vagina was higher in richness. Proteobacteria,<lb/> Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla observed across all samples.<lb/> Hydrotalea, Ralstonia, and Fusobacterium accounted for nearly 60% of the OTUs identified<lb/> in the vagina while organisms identified in the endometrium were more evenly distributed.<lb/> Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium were the prominent genera in the<lb/> endometrium. The microbiome of the endometrium was distinctly different from that of the<lb/> vagina. There was large animal-to-animal variation. Other than the vaginal microbiome of<lb/> bitches in estrus (i.e. in heat), there were no distinct clustering of the organisms based on<lb/> the stage of estrous. These findings establish the presence of a resident microbiome of the<lb/> endometrium throughout all stages of estrous cycle.<lb/></div>
