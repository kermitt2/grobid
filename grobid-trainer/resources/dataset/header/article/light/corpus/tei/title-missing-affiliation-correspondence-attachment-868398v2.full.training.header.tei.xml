	Abstract:<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Urodynamic studies, used to understand bladder function, diagnose bladder disease, and<lb/> develop treatments for dysfunctions, are ideally performed with awake subjects. However, in<lb/> animal models, especially cats (a common model of spinal cord injury and associated bladder<lb/> pathology), anesthesia is often required for these procedures and can be a research<lb/> confounder. This study compared the effects of select agents (dexmedetomidine, alfaxalone,<lb/> propofol, isoflurane, and α-chloralose) on urodynamic (Δpressure, bladder capacity, bladder<lb/> compliance, non-voiding contractions, bladder pressure slopes) and anesthetic (change in heart<lb/> rate [∆HR], average heart rate [HR], reflexes, induction/recovery times) parameters in repeated<lb/> cystometrograms across five adult male cats. Δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder<lb/> capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with α-<lb/>chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the<lb/> initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane<lb/> of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller ΔHR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared<lb/> to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery<lb/> was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and<lb/> anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.<lb/></div>
