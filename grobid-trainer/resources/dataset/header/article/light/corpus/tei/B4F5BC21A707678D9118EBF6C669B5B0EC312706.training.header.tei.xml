	<div type="abstract">The possibility that the neuropeptide neurotensin (NT)<lb/> may function as an endogenous antipsychotic compound<lb/> was first hypothesized almost two decades ago. Since that<lb/> time, considerable effort has been directed towards deter-<lb/>mining whether NT neurons mediate the effects of antipsy-<lb/>chotic drugs (APDs). The anatomic, biochemical, behav-<lb/>ioral, and clinical relevance of this hypothesis is reviewed.<lb/> Although the majority of the available evidence is indirect,<lb/> the availability of several NT receptor (NTR) antagonists<lb/> have now made possible the direct examination of the<lb/> involvement of the NT system in the mechanism of action<lb/> of APDs. Preliminary studies in our laboratory demon-<lb/>strate the ability of a selective NTR antagonist to block the<lb/> effects of APDs in two models of sensory motor gating<lb/> deficits characteristic of schizophrenia. These data, taken<lb/> together with a compelling series of studies demonstrating<lb/> that increases of NT/neuromedin N mRNA expression and<lb/> NT content in the nucleus accumbens and striatum after<lb/> chronic administration of APDs are predictive of clinical<lb/> efficacy and extrapyramidal side effects, respectively,<lb/> provide direct preclinical evidence for a role of the NT<lb/> system in the clinical efficacy of APDs. Although effects of<lb/> selective NTR antagonists in normal volunteers or schizo-<lb/>phrenic patients have not been studied, and nonpeptider-<lb/>gic NTR agonists have not yet been identified, these<lb/> cumulative results provide the groundwork for the use of<lb/> NT-ergic compounds in the treatment of schizophrenia.<lb/></div>
