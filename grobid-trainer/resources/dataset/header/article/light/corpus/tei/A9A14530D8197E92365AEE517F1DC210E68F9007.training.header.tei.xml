	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Objective To evaluate the effect of implementing<lb/> comprehensive, integrated electronic health record systems on<lb/> use and quality of ambulatory care<lb/> Design Retrospective, serial, cross sectional study.<lb/> Setting Colorado and Northwest regions of Kaiser Permanente,<lb/> a US integrated healthcare delivery system.<lb/> Population 367 795 members in the Colorado region and<lb/> 449 728 members in the Northwest region.<lb/> Intervention Implementation of electronic health record<lb/> systems.<lb/> Main outcome measures Total number of office visits and use<lb/> of primary care, specialty care, clinical laboratory, radiology<lb/> services, and telephone contact. Health Plan Employer Data<lb/> and Information Set to assess quality.<lb/> Results Two years after electronic health records were fully<lb/> implemented, age adjusted rates of office visits fell by 9% in<lb/> both regions. Age adjusted primary care visits decreased by<lb/> 11% in both regions and specialty care visits decreased by 5% in<lb/> Colorado and 6% in the Northwest. All these decreases were<lb/> significant (P &lt; 0.0001). The percentage of members making<lb/> ≥ 3 visits a year decreased by 10% in Colorado and 11% in the<lb/> Northwest, and the percentage of members with ≤ 2 visits a<lb/> year increased. In the Northwest, scheduled telephone contact<lb/> increased from a baseline of 1.26 per member per year to 2.09<lb/> after two years. Use of clinical laboratory and radiology services<lb/> did not change conclusively. Intermediate measures of quality<lb/> of health care remained unchanged or improved slightly.<lb/> Conclusions Readily available, comprehensive, integrated<lb/> clinical information reduced use of ambulatory care while<lb/> maintaining quality and allowed doctors to replace some office<lb/> visits with telephone contacts. Shifting patterns of use suggest<lb/> reduced numbers of ambulatory care visits that are<lb/> inappropriate or marginally productive.<lb/></div>
