	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background Differential expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data typically relies on<lb/> reconstructing transcripts or counting reads that overlap known gene structures. Previously we<lb/> introduced an intermediate approach called differentially expressed region (DER) finder that seeks<lb/> to identify contiguous regions of the genome showing differential expression signal at single base<lb/> resolution that does not rely on existing annotation or potentially inaccurate transcript discovery.<lb/> However, there were computational challenges involved with performing base-resolution analyses<lb/> in large numbers of samples at genome scale.<lb/> Results Here we describe a new version of the derfinder software that allows for: (1) genome-<lb/>scale analyses in a large number of samples, (2) flexible statistical modeling, including multi-group<lb/> and time course analyses, and (3) a new, computationally efficient approach to re-analysis at base<lb/> resolution called expressed-region analysis. We also introduce functionality for annotating and<lb/> plotting base-resolution data to identify artifacts and confirm results. We apply this approach<lb/></div>
