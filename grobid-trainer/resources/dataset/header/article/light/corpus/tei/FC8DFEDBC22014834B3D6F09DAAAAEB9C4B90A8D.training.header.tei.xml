	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">In the last 25 years, A-level Mathematics syllabi have changed very considerably,<lb/> introducing a broader range of application areas but reducing the previous emphasis<lb/> on classical mechanics. This article describes a baseline survey undertaken to estab-<lb/>lish in detail the entry levels in mechanics for the cohort of students entering<lb/> Engineering courses at Bristol University in October 2005. The survey results con-<lb/>¢rm and quantify existing anecdotal evidence indicating that universities must now<lb/> assume a considerably reduced familiarity with concepts in basic mechanics. These<lb/> changes have strong implications for future course design.<lb/></div>
