	<div type="abstract">Introduction. Delivery of vascular endothelial<lb/> growth factor (VEGF) protein or gene transfer has<lb/> been shown to accelerate re-endothelialization and at-<lb/>tenuate neointimal hyperplasia in various arterial in-<lb/>jury models, including balloon injury, stent implanta-<lb/>tion, and vein grafts. In addition to stimulating re-<lb/>endothelialization, we hypothesize that VEGF has<lb/> further vascular protective functions to prevent neo-<lb/>intimal hyperplasia by directly inhibiting mitogen-<lb/>induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells<lb/> (VSMCs) via the mitogen-activated protein kinase<lb/> pathway.<lb/> Materials and methods. Human aortic VSMCs were<lb/> seeded and serum starved for 24 h. The cells were then<lb/> stimulated with a mitogen, recombinant human plate-<lb/>let derived growth factor at 20 ng/mL together with 0,<lb/> 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 ng/mL recombinant human VEGF. A<lb/> proliferation assay was used to quantitate bromode-<lb/>oxyuridine uptake into newly synthesized DNA. West-<lb/>ern immunoassay was used to quantify extracellular<lb/> signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 protein and phos-<lb/>phorylation of retinoblastoma and ERK 1/2 protein.<lb/> Results. VEGF inhibited bromodeoxyuridine incor-<lb/>poration into mitogen-induced VSMC in a dose-<lb/>dependent manner, reaching statistical significance at<lb/> concentrations of 30 (P &lt; 0.05), 40 (P &lt; 0.05), and 50<lb/> ng/mL (P &lt; 0.01). Densitometry of western immuno-<lb/>blots revealed an inhibition of phosphorylation of ret-<lb/>inoblastoma at VEGF concentrations of 40 and 50<lb/> ng/mL and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation at concentrations<lb/> of 30, 40 and 50 ng/mL.<lb/> Conclusion. In addition to stimulating re-<lb/>endothelialization, VEGF appears to have a vascular<lb/> protective function by directly inhibiting VSMC pro-<lb/>liferation. This effect occurs in the absence of endo-<lb/>thelial cells and via the mitogen-activated protein ki-<lb/>nase pathway. VEGF may serve as an important<lb/> modulator of mitogen-induced VSMC proliferation af-<lb/>ter vascular injury.</div>
