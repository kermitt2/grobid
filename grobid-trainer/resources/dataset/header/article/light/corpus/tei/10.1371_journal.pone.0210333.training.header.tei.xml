	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Demonstrative reference is central to human communication. But what influences our<lb/> choice of demonstrative forms such as &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; in discourse? Previous literature has<lb/> mapped the use of such &quot;proximal&quot; and &quot;distal&quot; demonstratives onto spatial properties of ref-<lb/>erents, such as their distance from the speaker. We investigated whether object semantics,<lb/> and specifically functional properties of referents, also influence speakers&apos; choices of either<lb/> demonstrative form. Over two experiments, we presented English, Danish and Italian<lb/> speakers with words denoting animate and inanimate objects, differing in size and harmful-<lb/>ness, and asked them to match them with a proximal or a distal demonstrative. Objects that<lb/> offer more affordances for manipulation (smaller and harmless) elicited significantly more<lb/> proximal demonstratives. These effects were stronger for inanimate referents, in line with<lb/> the predictions of sensory-functional views on object semantics. These results suggest<lb/> that demonstrative use may be partly grounded on manual affordances, and hints at the<lb/> possibility of using demonstratives as a proxy to investigate the organization of semantic<lb/> knowledge.<lb/></div>
