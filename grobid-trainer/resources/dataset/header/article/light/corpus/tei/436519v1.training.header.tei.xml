	<div type="abstract">Mitochondria are organelles whose main role is energy production and might influence obesity.<lb/> They are the only organelles with their own genome. Here we have genotyped 435 patients with<lb/> type 1 diabetes using Illumina Infinium Omni Express Exome-8 v1.4 arrays and performed<lb/> mitoGWAS on BMI. We have analyzed additive interactions between mitochondrial and<lb/> nuclear variants in genes known to be associated with mitochondrial functioning<lb/> (MitoCarta2.0) and confirmed and refined the results on external cohorts -Framingham Heart<lb/> Study (FHS) and GTEx data. The linear mixed model analysis was performed using the<lb/> GENESIS package in R/Bioconductor We have found a nominal association between<lb/> rs28357980 localized to MT-ND2 and BMI (β=-0.69, p=0.056). This was confirmed on 1889<lb/> patients from FHS cohort (β =-0.312, p=0.047). Next, we have searched for additive<lb/> interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear variants. MT-ND2 variants interacted with<lb/> variants in SIRT3, ATP5B, CYCS, TFB2M and POLRMT genes. TFB2M is a mitochondrial<lb/> transcription factor and together with TFAM creates transcription promoter complex for<lb/> mitochondrial polymerase POLRMT. We have found that the interaction between rs3021088<lb/> of MT-ND2 gene and rs6701836 in TFB2M has led to BMI decrease (inter_pval=0.0241), while<lb/> interaction of rs3021088in MT-ND2 and rs41542013 in POLRMT gene led to BMI increase<lb/> (inter_pval=0.0004). The influence of these interactions on BMI was confirmed on external<lb/> cohorts. Here, we have shown that variants in mitochondrial genome as well as additive<lb/> interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear SNPs influence BMI in T1DM and general<lb/> cohorts.<lb/> production. They are the only organelles that contain their own genome. Thus, we have<lb/> genotyped 435 patients with type 1 diabetes and looked on single mitochondrial variant<lb/> influence as well as on additive interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear variants which<lb/> might affect BMI. Our analysis has shown, that rs28357980 localized to MT-ND2 is associated<lb/> with BMI. Next, we looked whether variants in this gene, which builds complex I of the electron<lb/> transport chain, might interact with nuclear variants and together they modify obesity risk. We<lb/> focused mainly on mitochondrial biogenesis and found that interactions between variants in<lb/> TFB2M (rs6701836) or POLRMT (rs41542013) and MT-ND2 (rs3021088) affect patients<lb/> BMI. TFB2M is a mitochondrial transcription factor which, together with TFAM, creates<lb/> transcription promoter complex and enables transcription by mitochondrial polymerase<lb/> POLRMT. The obtained results were also confirmed and refined on external cohorts -<lb/>Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and GTEx data. Thus, we have shown that variations in<lb/> mitochondrial genome and its interactions with nuclear variants might have an influence on<lb/> BMI.</div>
