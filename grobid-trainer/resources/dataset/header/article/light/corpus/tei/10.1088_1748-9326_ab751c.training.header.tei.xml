	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Sea salt aerosols (SSA), one of the most abundant aerosol species over the global oceans, play important<lb/> roles for Earth&apos;s climate. State-of-the-art SSA parameterizations in global climate models (GCMs) are<lb/> typically modeled using near-surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), and precipitation.<lb/> However, these have non-trivial biases in CMIP3 and CMIP5 GCMs over the tropical Pacific Ocean that<lb/> can contribute to biases in the simulated SSA. This study investigates the impacts of falling ice radiative<lb/> effects on the biases of the aforementioned modeled parameters and the resulting modeled SSA biases. We<lb/> compare the CMIP5 modeled SSA against satellite observations from MISR and MODIS using a pair of<lb/> sensitivity experiments with falling ice radiative effects on and off in the CESM1-CAM5 model. The results<lb/> show that when falling ice radiative effects are not taken into account, models have weaker surface wind<lb/> speeds, warmer SSTs, excessive precipitation, and diluted sea surface salinity (SSS) over the Pacific trade-<lb/>wind regions, leading to underestimated SSA. In the tropical Pacific Ocean, the inclusion of falling ice<lb/> radiative effects leads to improvements in the modeled near-surface wind speeds, SSTs, and precipitation<lb/> through cloud-precipitation-radiation-circulation coupling, which results in more representative patterns<lb/> of SSA and reduces the SSA biases by ∼10% to 15% relative to the satellite observations. Models including<lb/> falling ice radiative effects in CMIP5 produce smaller biases in SSA than those without falling ice radiative<lb/> effects. We suggest that one of the causes of these biases is likely the failure to account for falling ice radiative<lb/> effects, and these biases in turn affect the direct and indirect effects of SSA in the GCMs.<lb/></div>
