	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Authorship guidelines have established criteria to guide author selection based on significance of contribution and helped<lb/> to define associated responsibilities and accountabilities for the published findings. However, low awareness, variable<lb/> interpretation, and inconsistent application of these guidelines can lead to confusion and a lack of transparency when<lb/> recognizing those who merit authorship. This article describes a research project led by the Medical Publishing Insights and<lb/> Practices (MPIP) Initiative to identify current challenges when determining authorship for industry-sponsored clinical trials<lb/> and develop an improved approach to facilitate decision-making when recognizing authors from related publications. A<lb/> total of 498 clinical investigators, journal editors, publication professionals and medical writers were surveyed to understand<lb/> better how they would adjudicate challenging, real-world authorship case scenarios, determine the perceived frequency of<lb/> each scenario and rate their confidence in the responses provided. Multiple rounds of discussions about these results with<lb/> journal editors, clinical investigators and industry representatives led to the development of key recommendations intended<lb/> to enhance transparency when determining authorship. These included forming a representative group to establish<lb/> authorship criteria early in a trial, having all trial contributors agree to these criteria and documenting trial contributions to<lb/> objectively determine who warrants an invitation to participate in the manuscript development process. The resulting<lb/> Five-step Authorship Framework is designed to create a more standardized approach when determining authorship for<lb/> clinical trial publications. Overall, these recommendations aim to facilitate more transparent authorship decisions and help<lb/> readers better assess the credibility of results and perspectives of the authors for medical research more broadly.<lb/></div>
