	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: The importance of hybridisation during species diversification has long been debated among<lb/> evolutionary biologists. It is increasingly recognised that hybridisation events occurred during the evolutionary<lb/> history of numerous species, especially during the early stages of adaptive radiation. We study the effect of<lb/> hybridisation on diversification in the clownfishes, a clade of coral reef fish that diversified through an adaptive<lb/> radiation process. While two species of clownfish are likely to have been described from hybrid specimens, the<lb/> occurrence and effect of hybridisation on the clade diversification is yet unknown.<lb/> Results: We generate sequences of three mitochondrial genes to complete an existing dataset of nuclear<lb/> sequences and document cytonuclear discordance at a node, which shows a drastic increase of diversification rate.<lb/> Then, using a tree-based jack-knife method, we identify clownfish species likely stemming from hybridisation events.<lb/> Finally, we use molecular cloning and identify the putative parental species of four clownfish specimens that display<lb/> the morphological characteristics of hybrids.<lb/> Conclusions: Our results show that consistently with the syngameon hypothesis, hybridisation events are linked<lb/> with a burst of diversification in the clownfishes. Moreover, several recently diverged clownfish lineages likely<lb/> originated through hybridisation, which indicates that diversification, catalysed by hybridisation events, may still be<lb/> happening.<lb/></div>
