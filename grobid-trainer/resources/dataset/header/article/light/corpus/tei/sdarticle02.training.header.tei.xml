	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Disturbed sleep has been linked to increased morbidity, mortality and depression and worsened health-related quality of life in<lb/> patients with chronic illness. Few studies of readjustment after coronary artery disease have explicitly focused on sleep disturbance.<lb/> Aim: To explore associations between disturbed sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression, and to assess to what extent fatigue four months post-<lb/>MI could be explained.<lb/> Method: The sample included 204 consecutive patients, ≤ 80 years of age who answered questionnaires about disturbed sleep, fatigue,<lb/> anxiety and depression four months after MI.<lb/> Results: The variables anxiety, depression and disturbed sleep were all associated with fatigue. The regression model accounted for 46% of<lb/> the variance in fatigue with depression and disturbed sleep as predictors. Infarct size measured by conventional biochemical markers, left<lb/> ventricle ejection fraction and history of previous MI were not correlated with disturbed sleep, fatigue, anxiety or depression.<lb/> Conclusions: From knowledge about associations between disturbed sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression after MI, cardiac nurses could be<lb/> trained to observe such symptoms. Optimal care for sleep disturbance may include actions to reduce anxiety and depression as well as self-<lb/>care advices about sleep hygiene in order to improve sleep quality and reduce fatigue.<lb/></div>
