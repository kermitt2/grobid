	<div type="abstract">Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections caused by the opportunistic pathogen<lb/> Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH) are currently receiving renewed<lb/> attention due to increased incidence combined with difficult treatment. Insights into<lb/> the disease-causing mechanisms of this species have been hampered by difficulties in<lb/> genetic manipulation of the bacteria. Here, we identified and sequenced a highly<lb/> transformable, virulent MAH clinical isolate susceptible to high-density transposon<lb/> mutagenesis, facilitating global gene disruption and subsequent investigation of MAH<lb/> gene function. By transposon insertion sequencing (TnSeq) of this strain, we defined<lb/> the MAH genome-wide genetic requirement for virulence and in vitro growth, and<lb/> organized ~3500 identified transposon mutants for hypothesis-driven research. The<lb/> majority (71 %) of the genes we identified as essential for MAH in vitro had a<lb/> growth-essential mutual ortholog in the related and highly virulent M. tuberculosis<lb/> (Mtb). However, passaging our library through a mouse model of infection revealed a<lb/> substantial number (54% of total hits) of novel virulence genes. Strikingly, &gt; 97 % of<lb/> the MAH virulence genes had a mutual ortholog in Mtb. Two of the three virulence<lb/> genes specific to MAH (i.e. no Mtb mutual orthologs) were PPE proteins, a family of<lb/> proteins unique to mycobacteria and highly associated with virulence. Finally, we<lb/> validated novel genes as required for successful MAH infection; one encoding a<lb/> probable MFS transporter and another a hypothetical protein located in immediate<lb/> vicinity of six other identified virulence genes. In summary, we provide new,<lb/> fundamental insights into the underlying genetic requirement of MAH for growth and<lb/> host infection.</div>
