	Abstract.
	<div type="abstract">A distributed, multi-vehicle concept for future space missions has been conceived as a solution<lb/> to the problem of advancing space-based operations within budgetary constraints. Broadly named<lb/> formation flying, this approach to designing distributed systems across multiple, spatially disbursed<lb/> platforms is enabled by collectively coordinating a fleet of autonomous spacecraft to function as a unified<lb/> system. Formation flying offers potential advantages of improved robustness, capability, and cost relative<lb/> to complicated, single platform systems by using multiple, often small, spacecraft to perform complex<lb/> multi-sensor tasks. A necessary element in the realization of formation flying systems is the development<lb/> of methods and technologies that facilitate the transition from treating a distributed spacecraft system as<lb/> individual elements, to viewing a formation as a coordinated system unified by common objectives.<lb/> This paper describes the results of research performed to identify fundamental issues that affect the<lb/> development of command and control (C 2 ) methods applicable to coordinating distributed small<lb/> spacecraft systems. A discrete event method of distributed command and control is described that is<lb/> particularly well suited to small spacecraft formation flying. Utilized in many complex terrestrial systems,<lb/> discrete event systems (DES) concepts facilitate coordination of distributed systems at multiple levels of<lb/> resolution in an efficient manner. DES also provide a means to integrate intelligent planning and<lb/> processing operations while interfacing with more traditional subsystem controllers. The basic principals<lb/> and applicability of DES are described within the context of formation flying and example distributed<lb/> spacecraft C 2 operations are defined.</div>
