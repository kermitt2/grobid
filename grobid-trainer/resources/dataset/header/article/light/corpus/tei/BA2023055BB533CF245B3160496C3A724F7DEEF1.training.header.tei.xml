	<div type="abstract">Although caloric restriction in numerous models extends life, longevity in humans is suggested<lb/> to be limited by the increased prevalence of obesity. Adiponectin, a fat-derived peptide, has<lb/> a protective role against age-related disease, and thus is an excellent candidate gene for longevity.<lb/> We studied adiponectin levels in centenarians (n ¼ 118), their offspring (n ¼ 228), and unrelated<lb/> participants ,95 (n ¼ 78). Adiponectin levels were significantly greater in participants older than<lb/> 95 years (p ¼ .01), an effect that was independent of sex and body mass index (BMI).<lb/> Adiponectin levels in the offspring were higher (following adjustment for age, sex, and BMI)<lb/> compared to controls (p ¼ .02), suggesting that inherited factors play a role in determining<lb/> adiponectin levels. Over-representation of two common variants in Adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ)<lb/> in male long-lived individuals combined with their independent association with elevated plasma<lb/> adiponectin levels (in men and women) suggests that their presence may promote increased life<lb/> span through the regulation of adiponectin production and/or secretion.<lb/></div>
