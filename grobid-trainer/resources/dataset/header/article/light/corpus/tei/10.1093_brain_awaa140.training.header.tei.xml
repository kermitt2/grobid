	<div type="abstract">Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury in American football players has garnered increasing public attention following reports of<lb/> chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive tauopathy. While the mechanisms underlying repetitive mild traumatic brain injury-<lb/>induced neurodegeneration are unknown and antemortem diagnostic tests are not available, neuropathology studies suggest a patho-<lb/>genic role for microvascular injury, specifically blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Thus, our main objective was to demonstrate the ef-<lb/>fectiveness of a modified dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI approach we have developed to detect impairments in brain microvascular<lb/> function. To this end, we scanned 42 adult male amateur American football players and a control group comprising 27 athletes prac-<lb/>ticing a non-contact sport and 26 non-athletes. MRI scans were also performed in 51 patients with brain pathologies involving the<lb/> blood-brain barrier, namely malignant brain tumours, ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic traumatic contusion. Based on data from<lb/> prolonged scans, we generated maps that visualized the permeability value for each brain voxel. Our permeability maps revealed an<lb/> increase in slow blood-to-brain transport in a subset of amateur American football players, but not in sex-and age-matched controls.<lb/> The increase in permeability was region specific (white matter, midbrain peduncles, red nucleus, temporal cortex) and correlated with<lb/> changes in white matter, which were confirmed by diffusion tensor imaging. Additionally, increased permeability persisted for months,<lb/> as seen in players who were scanned both on-and off-season. Examination of patients with brain pathologies revealed that slow<lb/> tracer accumulation characterizes areas surrounding the core of injury, which frequently shows fast blood-to-brain transport. Next,<lb/> we verified our method in two rodent models: rats and mice subjected to repeated mild closed-head impact injury, and rats with vas-<lb/>cular injury inflicted by photothrombosis. In both models, slow blood-to-brain transport was observed, which correlated with neuro-<lb/>pathological changes. Lastly, computational simulations and direct imaging of the transport of Evans blue-albumin complex in brains<lb/> of rats subjected to recurrent seizures or focal cerebrovascular injury suggest that increased cellular transport underlies the observed<lb/> slow blood-to-brain transport. Taken together, our findings suggest dynamic contrast-enhanced-MRI can be used to diagnose specific<lb/> microvascular pathology after traumatic brain injury and other brain pathologies.<lb/></div>
