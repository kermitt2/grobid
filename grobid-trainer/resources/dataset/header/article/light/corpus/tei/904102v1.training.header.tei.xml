	Abstract:<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Clinical records of dogs with spontaneous degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) with<lb/> clinical signs related to congestive heart failure (CHF) that had been recruited during routine<lb/> clinical practice, between 2001 and 2018 at the Cardiology Unit of the Veterinary Teaching<lb/> Hospital (University of Milan) were included in this retrospective cohort study. Baseline<lb/> echocardiographic data were evaluated. Median survival times (MSTs) were calculated. Data<lb/> on therapeutic treatment, ISACHC or ACVIM classes were reviewed based on the inclusion<lb/> period and type of endpoint (i.e. cardiac death or death for other causes). The main goal of<lb/> this data review was to retrospectively evaluate 259 clinical records of subjects belonging to<lb/> ACVIM C class examined between 2001 to 2018 together with the 202 examined between<lb/> 2010 to 2018. The MSTs of these subjects was 531 d (2001-2018) and 335.5 d (2010-2018),<lb/> respectively. Univariate survival regression analysis for subjects included from 2010 to 2018<lb/> showed the following variables as being significantly related to cardiac death (CD): LA/Ao<lb/> ratio (HR 2.754, p=0.000), E wave (HR 2.961, p=0.000), E/A ratio (HR 1.372, p=0.000),<lb/> EDVI (HR 1.007, p=0.000), ESVI (HR 1.012, p=0.026), Allo(d) (HR 4.018, p=0.000) and<lb/> Allo(s) (HR 2.674, p=0.049), age (HR 1.006, p=0.009) and PH severity (HR=1.309, p=0.012).<lb/> Multivariate analysis, adjusted for age, showed that the only variable that determined a<lb/> statistically significant difference in MST was PH severity (HR 1.334, p=0.033). The type of<lb/> therapeutic treatment within this class was not significant for the MST of the subjects.<lb/></div>
