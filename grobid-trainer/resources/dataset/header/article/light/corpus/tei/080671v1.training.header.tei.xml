	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Microbial communities inhabiting subsurface sediments contain abundant heterotrophs,<lb/> which oxidize organic matter to obtain carbon and energy. Subsurface sediments contain<lb/> very low concentrations of canonically bioavailable compounds, and it is not clear what<lb/> fraction of sedimentary organic matter the community metabolizes. To gain a more<lb/> mechanistic understanding of subsurface heterotrophy, we studied both the genetic<lb/> potential encoded within metagenomes for extracellular peptidase production, and<lb/> experimentally assayed the potential activities of a wide range of extracellular peptidases<lb/> in sediments of the White Oak River estuary, NC. Deeply sequenced metagenomes<lb/> revealed genes coding for at least 15 classes of extracellular peptidases. We observed<lb/> enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of 11 different peptidase substrates in subsurface sediments.<lb/> Potential activities (V max ) of extracellular peptidases decreased downcore, but cell-<lb/>specific V max was relatively constant and similar to values observed in seawater<lb/> phytoplankton blooms. Decreases in half-saturation constants and relative increases in<lb/> activities of D-phenylalanyl aminopeptidase and ornithyl aminopeptidase with depth<lb/> indicate a community of heterotrophs that is adapted to access degraded organic matter.<lb/> These results suggest a subsurface heterotrophic community that converts degraded<lb/> organic matter into a bioavailable form, rather than a surface-adapted community relying<lb/> on ever-decreasing concentrations of more labile organic matter.</div>
