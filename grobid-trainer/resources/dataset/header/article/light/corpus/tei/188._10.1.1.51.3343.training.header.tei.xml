	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">E cient path computation necessary for route guidance has been identi ed as one of the key requirements<lb/> for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. While the current ITS literature has focused on<lb/> the application of search algorithms (typically, heuristic A* algorithms) to provide for compute-on-demand<lb/> path nding, we propose an encoded path view approach that precomputes optimal paths. Advantages of<lb/> our approach include (1) route search is e cient and less dependent on system load, (2) alternative paths<lb/> are materialized in addition to the optimal paths, simplifying the process of global optimization, (3) the<lb/> storage overhead is manageable and less than for the full enumeration of all possible paths. In this paper,<lb/> we present algorithms for incrementally updating the encoded path view structure in response to weight<lb/> changes on the tra c links of the underlying network. Despite non-optimal paths also being materialized, our<lb/> algorithms are designed to operate on cyclic planar graphs | given that ITS maps typically correspond to<lb/> highly interconnected grid structures. In this paper, we show that while our approach does not encode all<lb/> paths, it omits some non-optimal paths to resolve cycle ambivalence and will recover them once they become<lb/> optimal. Proofs of correctness and of complexity are also given. We demonstrate the potential of our approach<lb/> by presenting experimental results of evaluating our approach both on randomly generated as well as on real<lb/> city map data. Our experiments furthermore compare the proposed approach against more conventional path<lb/> searching algorithms, which correspond to the state-of-the-art for route guidance in ITS.<lb/></div>
