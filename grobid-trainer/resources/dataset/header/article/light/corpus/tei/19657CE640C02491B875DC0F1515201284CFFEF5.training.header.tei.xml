	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background. This in vitro study aimed to elucidate the extent and kind of involvement<lb/> of hyaluronic acid (HA) in the currently accepted view of synovial joint lubrication, in which<lb/> surface-active phospholipids (SAPL) constitute the main boundary lubricant. The integrity<lb/> of SAPL is apparently threatened by the lysing activity of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ).<lb/> Methods. The effects of increasing concentrations of HA degraded by free radicals and<lb/> non-degraded HA on the lysing activity of PLA 2 were examined in vitro. Liposomes (lipid model<lb/> membrane) containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) were used as the substrate, on the assumption<lb/> that they are appropriate representatives of SAPL.<lb/> Results. HA adhered to the phospholipid membrane (liposomes), inhibiting their lysis by<lb/> PLA 2 . However, in its degraded form, HA not only failed to inhibit PLA 2 -lysing activity, but<lb/> accelerated it.<lb/> Conclusions. It is reasonable to assume that HA plays an important indirect role in the steady<lb/> state of the boundary lubrication process of joints by protecting SAPL from being lysed by<lb/> PLA 2 . However, as excessive loading generates free radicals within the joint (among other<lb/> effects), the HA that is degraded in this way is incapable of protecting SAPL from lysis by PLA 2 .<lb/> When the rate of degradation exceeds that of synthesis, there will be insuf®cient replacement<lb/> of HA anduor SAPL, resulting in denudation of the articular surfaces. These are then exposed<lb/> to increasing friction, and hence increased danger of degenerative joint changes.<lb/></div>
