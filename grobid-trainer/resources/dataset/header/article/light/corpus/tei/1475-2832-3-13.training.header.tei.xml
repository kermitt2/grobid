	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: It has been suggested that lithium increases choline concentrations, although<lb/> previous human studies examining this possibility using 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H<lb/> MRS) have had mixed results: some found increases while most found no differences.<lb/> Methods: The present study utilized 1 H MRS, in a 3 T scanner to examine the effects of both<lb/> lithium and sodium valproate upon choline concentrations in treated euthymic bipolar patients<lb/> utilizing two different methodologies. In the first part of the study healthy controls (n = 18) were<lb/> compared with euthymic Bipolar Disorder patients (Type I and Type II) who were taking either<lb/> lithium (n = 14) or sodium valproate (n = 11), and temporal lobe choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratios<lb/> were determined. In the second part we examined a separate group of euthymic Bipolar Disorder<lb/> Type I patients taking sodium valproate (n = 9) and compared these to controls (n = 11). Here we<lb/> measured the absolute concentrations of choline in both temporal and frontal lobes.<lb/> Results: The results from the first part of the study showed that bipolar patients chronically<lb/> treated with both lithium and sodium valproate had significantly reduced temporal lobe Cho/Cr<lb/> ratios. In contrast, in the second part of the study, there were no effects of sodium valproate on<lb/> either absolute choline concentrations or on Cho/Cr ratios in either temporal or frontal lobes.<lb/> Conclusions: These findings suggest that measuring Cho/Cr ratios may not accurately reflect<lb/> brain choline concentrations. In addition, the results do not support previous suggestions that<lb/> either lithium or valproate increases choline concentrations in bipolar patients.<lb/></div>
