	<div type="abstract">A library of recombinant glutathione transferases (GSTs)<lb/> generated by shuffling of DNA encoding human GST<lb/> M1-1 and GST M2-2 was screened with eight alternative<lb/> substrates, and the activities were subjected to multi-<lb/>variate analysis. Assays were made in lysates of bacteria<lb/> in which the GST variants had been expressed. The<lb/> primary data showed clustering of the activities in eight-<lb/>dimensional substrate-activity space. For an incisive<lb/> analysis, the rows of the data matrix, corresponding to<lb/> the different enzyme variants, were individually scaled to<lb/> unit length, thus accounting for different expression levels<lb/> of the enzymes. The columns representing the activities<lb/> with alternative substrates were subsequently individually<lb/> normalized to unit variance and a zero mean. By this<lb/> standardization, the data were adjusted to comparable<lb/> orders of magnitude. Three molecular quasi-species were<lb/> recognized by multivariate K-means and principal com-<lb/>ponent analyses. Two of them encompassed the parental<lb/> GST M1-1 and GST M2-2. A third one diverged func-<lb/>tionally by displaying enhanced activities with some sub-<lb/>strates and suppressed activities with signature substrates<lb/> for GST M1-1 and GST M2-2. A fourth cluster contained<lb/> mutants with impaired functions and was not regarded as<lb/> a quasi-species. Sequence analysis of representatives of<lb/> the mutant clusters demonstrated that the majority of the<lb/> variants in the diverging novel quasi-species were structu-<lb/>rally similar to the M1-like GSTs, but distinguished<lb/> themselves from GST M1-1 by a Ser to Thr substitution<lb/> in the active site. The data show that multivariate analysis<lb/> of functional profiles can identify small structural<lb/> changes influencing the evolution of enzymes with novel<lb/> substrate-activity profiles.<lb/></div>
