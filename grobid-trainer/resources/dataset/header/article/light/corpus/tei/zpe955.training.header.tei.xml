	<titlePart>NIAID-Sponsored 2010 Guidelines for Managing Food<lb/> Allergy: Applications in the Pediatric Population</titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Data from many studies have suggested a rise in the prevalence of food<lb/> allergies during the past 10 to 20 years. Currently, no curative treat-<lb/>ments for food allergy exist, and there are no effective means of pre-<lb/>venting the disease. Management of food allergy involves strict avoid-<lb/>ance of the allergen in the patient&apos;s diet and treatment of symptoms as<lb/> they arise. Because diagnosis and management of the disease can vary<lb/> between clinical practice settings, the National Institute of Allergy and<lb/> Infectious Diseases (NIAID) sponsored development of clinical guide-<lb/>lines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy. The guidelines<lb/> establish consensus and consistency in definitions, diagnostic criteria,<lb/> and management practices. They also provide concise recommenda-<lb/>tions on how to diagnose and manage food allergy and treat acute food<lb/> allergy reactions. The original guidelines encompass practices rele-<lb/>vant to patients of all ages, but food allergy presents unique and spe-<lb/>cific concerns for infants, children, and teenagers. To focus on those<lb/> concerns, we describe here the guidelines most pertinent to the pedi-<lb/>atric population.</div>
