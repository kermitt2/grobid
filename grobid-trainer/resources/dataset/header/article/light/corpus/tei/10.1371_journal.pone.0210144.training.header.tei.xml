	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The expansion of black mangrove Avicennia germinans into historically smooth cordgrass<lb/> Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes with warming temperatures heralds the migration<lb/> of the marsh-mangrove ecotone northward in the northern Gulf of Mexico. With this shift,<lb/> A. germinans is expected to outcompete S. alterniflora where it is able to establish, offering<lb/> another prevalent food source to first order consumers. In this study, we find A. germinans<lb/> leaves to be preferable to chewing herbivores, but simultaneously, chewing herbivores<lb/> cause more damage to S. alterniflora leaves. Despite higher nitrogen content, A. germinans<lb/> leaves decomposed slower than S. alterniflora leaves, perhaps due to other leaf constitu-<lb/>ents or a different microbial community. Other studies have found the opposite in decompo-<lb/>sition rates of the two species&apos; leaf tissue. This study provides insights into basic trophic<lb/> process, herbivory and decomposition, at the initial stages of black mangrove colonization<lb/> into S. alterniflora salt marsh.<lb/></div>
