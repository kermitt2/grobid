	<div type="abstract">A century of research on chimpanzees, both in their natural habitat and in captivity, has brought these apes socially,<lb/> emotionally and mentally much closer to us. Parallels and homologues between chimpanzee and human behaviour range<lb/> from tool-technology and cultural learning to power politics and intercommunity warfare. Few behavioural domains have<lb/> remained untouched by this increased knowledge, which has dramatically challenged the way we view ourselves. The<lb/> sequencing of the chimpanzee genome will no doubt bring more surprises and insights. Humans do occupy a special<lb/> place among the primates, but this place increasingly has to be defined against a backdrop of substantial similarity.</div>
