	ABSTRACT:
	<div type="abstract">This paper reports data on reliability and validity of the Role Function-<lb/>ing Scale (RFS) a measure of level of functioning of adults in four domains. Psycho-<lb/>metric properties were tested on an inner city sample of 112 psychiatrically disturbed<lb/> and well, predominantly African-American, low-income mothers of young children. The<lb/> RFS has good interitem, test-retest, and interrater reliability. The four scales and<lb/> global RFS Index discriminated accurately between well and disturbed subjects. The<lb/> Global RFS Index was significantly correlated with self-esteem and degree of distur-<lb/>bance. Individual scales demonstrated predicted relationships with quality of child-<lb/>rearing and other independent behavioral indices. Results are discussed in terms of the<lb/> unique information provided by the RFS and its potential contribution to treatment<lb/> planning.<lb/></div>
