	<div type="abstract">2 studies examined children&apos;s appraisals of marital conflict. In Study 1, 45 11-and 12-year-<lb/>olds reported cognitive, affective, and coping responses to conflicts varying in content and inten-<lb/>sity. When conflict concerned the child, children reported more shame and fear of being drawn<lb/> into the conflict and tended to endorse coping responses that involved direct intervention in it.<lb/> More intense conflicts led to greater negative affect and perceived threat. In Study 2,112 12-year-<lb/>olds responded to conflicts that included a parent-blaming or child-blaming explanation or gave<lb/> no explanation for the conflict. Explanations that absolved the children of blame for the conflict<lb/> decreased their fear of becoming involved in the conflict and their desire to intervene in it.<lb/> These findings show that appraisals of marital conflict are influenced by its content, intensity,<lb/> and cause and suggest that the meaning of conflict to children is an important determinant of its<lb/> impact.<lb/></div>
