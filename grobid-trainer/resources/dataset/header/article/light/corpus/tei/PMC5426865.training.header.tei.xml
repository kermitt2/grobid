	Operative Technique 

	<div type="abstract">I<lb/> n Asian rhinoplasty, for patients who mostly have low<lb/> and small noses compared to Caucasians, the most fre-<lb/>quently performed procedures are nasal tip projection,<lb/> lengthening and augmentation.<lb/> Various alloplastic materials such as silicone, polytet-<lb/>rafluoroethylene, high-density polyethylene (Medpor,<lb/> Stryker), etc., have been applied for such operations even<lb/> until recently. 1,2 However, when these implants are used<lb/> improperly or cause infection, it may result in severe con-<lb/>tracture that is very hard to correct.<lb/></div>
