	<div type="abstract">The major changes in hormone levels that occur through the menstrual cycle have been postulated to affect the expression of<lb/> hormone-regulated and proliferation-associated genes (PAGs) in premenopausal ER+ breast cancer. Whilst previous studies have<lb/> demonstrated differences in gene expression, here, we investigated if there are within patient changes in the expression of<lb/> oestrogen-and progesterone-regulated genes (ERGs and PRGs) and PAGs in ER+ breast cancer during the menstrual cycle. Samples<lb/> from 96 patients in two independent prospective studies of the effect of menstrual cycle on ER+ breast cancer were used. Plasma<lb/> hormone measurements were used to assign tumours to one of three pre-defined menstrual cycle windows: W1 (days 27-35 and<lb/> 1-6; low oestradiol and low progesterone), W2 (days 7-16; high oestradiol and low progesterone) and W3 (days 17-26;<lb/> intermediate oestradiol and high progesterone). RNA expression of 50 genes, including 27 ERGs, 11 putative PRGs and seven PAGs<lb/> was measured. The AvERG (geomean of PGR, GREB1, TFF1 and PDZK1) was used as a composite measure of ERG expression and<lb/> showed significant changes between the three windows of the menstrual cycle increasing over 2.2-fold between W1 and W2 and<lb/> decreasing between W2 and W3 and between W3 and W1. Proliferation gene expression also varied significantly, following the<lb/> same pattern of changes as ERG expression, but the changes were of lower magnitude (1.4-fold increase between W1 and W2).<lb/> Significant changes in the expression of eight individual ERGs, including GREB1, PGR and TFF1, and two PAGs were observed<lb/> between W1 and either W2 or W3 with all genes showing higher levels in W2 or W3 (1.3-2.4-fold; FDR 0.016-0.05). The AvProg, a<lb/> composite measure of PRG expression, increased significantly (1.5-fold) in W3 compared to W1 or W2 but no significant changes<lb/> were observed for individual PRGs. In conclusion, we observed significant changes in ERG, PRG and PAG expression in ER+ breast<lb/> tumours during the menstrual cycle that may affect the assessment and interpretation of prominent biomarkers (e.g. PgR) and<lb/> commonly used multigene prognostic signatures in premenopausal ER+ breast cancer.<lb/></div>
