	Summary
	<div type="abstract">Hotelling&apos;s T 2 procedure is used to test the equality of means in two-<lb/>group multivariate designs when covariances are homogeneous. A number of alter-<lb/>natives to T 2 , which are robust to covariance heterogeneity, have been proposed in<lb/> the literature. However, all are sensitive to departures from multivariate normal-<lb/>ity. We demonstrate how to obtain multivariate tests that are robust to covariance<lb/> heterogeneity and non-normality with estimators of location and scale based on<lb/> trimming and Winsorizing. The performance of six alternatives to T 2 was examined<lb/> via Monte Carlo methods when characteristics of the research design, degree of co-<lb/>variance heterogeneity, and degree of non-normality were manipulated. We have<lb/> recently developed a program written in the SAS/IML language that can be used to<lb/> implement these robust multivariate tests. Recommendations are provided on the<lb/> specific data-analytic conditions under which these tests should be adopted.<lb/></div>
