	<div type="abstract">We have studied extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in spacetimes containing a rotating black hole<lb/> and a non-self-gravitating torus with a constant distribution of specific angular momentum. We have found<lb/> that the dissipative effect of the hydrodynamic drag exerted by the torus on the satellite is much smaller<lb/> than the corresponding one due to radiation reaction, for systems such as those generically expected in<lb/> active galactic nuclei and at distances from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) which can be<lb/> probed with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, given the uncertainty on the<lb/> parameters of these systems, namely, on the masses of the SMBH and of the torus, as well as on its size,<lb/> there exist configurations in which the effect of the hydrodynamic drag on the orbital evolution can be<lb/> comparable to the radiation reaction one in phases of the inspiral which are detectable by the Laser<lb/> Interferometer Space Antenna. This is the case, for instance, for a 10 6 M SMBH surrounded by a<lb/> corotating torus of comparable mass and with radius of 10 3 -10 4 gravitational radii, or for a 10 5 M SMBH<lb/> surrounded by a corotating 10 4 M torus with radius of 10 5 gravitational radii. Should these conditions be<lb/> met in astrophysical systems, EMRI-gravitational waves could provide a characteristic signature of the<lb/> presence of the torus. In fact, while radiation reaction always increases the inclination of the orbit with<lb/> respect to the equatorial plane (i.e., orbits evolve towards the equatorial retrograde configuration), the<lb/> hydrodynamic drag from a torus corotating with the SMBH always decreases it (i.e., orbits evolve towards<lb/> the equatorial prograde configuration). However, even when initially dominating over radiation reaction,<lb/> the influence of the hydrodynamic drag decays very rapidly as the satellite moves into the very strong-field<lb/> region of the SMBH (i.e., p &amp; 5M), thus allowing one to use pure-Kerr templates for the last part of the<lb/> inspiral. Although our results have been obtained for a specific class of tori, we argue that they will be<lb/> qualitatively valid also for more generic distributions of the specific angular momentum.<lb/></div>
