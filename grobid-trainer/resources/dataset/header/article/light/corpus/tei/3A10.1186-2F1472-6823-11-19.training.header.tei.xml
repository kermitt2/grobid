	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Sub-Saharan Africa is currently enduring the heaviest global burden of diabetes and diabetes care in<lb/> such resource poor countries is far below standards. This study aims to describe the gaps in the care of Ethiopian<lb/> diabetic patients at Jimma University Specialized Hospital.<lb/> Methods: 329 diabetic patients were selected as participants in the study, aged 15 years or greater, who have<lb/> been active in follow-up for their diabetes for more than 1 year at the hospital. They were interviewed for their<lb/> demographic characters and relevant clinical profiles. Their charts were simultaneously reviewed for characters<lb/> related to diabetes and related morbidities. Descriptive statistics was used for most variables and Chi-square test,<lb/> where necessary, was used to test the association among various variables. P-value of &lt; 0.05 was used as statistical<lb/> significance.<lb/> Results: Blood glucose determination was done for 98.5% of patients at each of the last three visits, but none ever<lb/> had glycosylated haemoglobin results. The mean fasting blood sugar (FBS) level was 171.7 ± 63.6 mg/dl and 73.1%<lb/> of patients had mean FBS levels above 130 mg/dl. Over 44% of patients have already been diagnosed to be<lb/> hypertensive and 64.1% had mean systolic BP of &gt; 130 and/or diastolic &gt; 80 mmHg over the last three visits.<lb/> Diabetes eye and neurologic evaluations were ever done for 42.9% and 9.4% of patients respectively. About 66%<lb/> had urine test for albumin, but only 28.2% had renal function testing over the last 5 years. The rates for lipid test,<lb/> electrocardiography, echocardiography, or ultrasound of the kidneys during the same time were &lt; 5% for each.<lb/> Diabetic neuropathy (25.0%) and retinopathy (23.1%) were the most common chronic complications documented<lb/> among those evaluated for complications.<lb/> Conclusions: The overall aspects of diabetes care at the hospital were far below any recommended standards.<lb/> Hence, urgent action to improve care for patients with diabetes is mandatory. Future studies examining patterns<lb/> and prevalence of chronic complications using appropriate parameters is strongly recommended to see the true<lb/> burden of diabetes.<lb/></div>
