	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">In an effort to push the envelope of system performance, mi-<lb/>croprocessor designs are continually exploiting higher levels of<lb/> instruction-level parallelism, resulting in increasing bandwidth de-<lb/>mands on the address translation mechanism. Most current micro-<lb/>processor designs meet this demand with a multi-ported TLB. While<lb/> this design provides an excellent hit rate at each port, its access la-<lb/>tency and area grow very quickly as the number of ports is increased.<lb/> As bandwidth demands continue to increase, multi-ported designs<lb/> will soon impact memory access latency.<lb/> We present four high-bandwidth address translation mechanisms<lb/> with latency and area characteristics that scale better than a multi-<lb/>ported TLB design. We extend traditional high-bandwidth memory<lb/> design techniques to address translation, developing interleaved and<lb/> multi-level TLB designs. In addition, we introduce two new designs<lb/> crafted specifically for high-bandwidth address translation. Piggy-<lb/>back ports are introduced as a technique to exploit spatial locality in<lb/> simultaneous translation requests, allowing accesses to the same vir-<lb/>tual memory page to combine their requests at the TLB access port.<lb/> Pretranslation is introduced as a technique for attaching translations<lb/> to base register values, making it possible to reuse a single transla-<lb/>tion many times.<lb/> We perform extensive simulation-based studies to evaluate our<lb/> designs. We vary key system parameters, such as processor model,<lb/> page size, and number of architected registers, to see what effects<lb/> these changes have on the relative merits of each approach. A num-<lb/>ber of designs show particular promise. Multi-level TLBs with as<lb/> few as eight entries in the upper-level TLB nearly achieve the per-<lb/>formance of a TLB with unlimited bandwidth. Piggyback ports<lb/> combined with a lesser-ported TLB structure, e.g., an interleaved or<lb/> multi-ported TLB, also perform well. Pretranslation over a single-<lb/>ported TLB performs almost as well as a same-sized multi-level<lb/> TLB with the added benefit of decreased access latency for physi-<lb/>cally indexed caches.<lb/></div>
