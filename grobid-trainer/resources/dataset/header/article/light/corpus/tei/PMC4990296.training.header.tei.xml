	Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Introduction<lb/> Twitter is a popular microblogging platform for the rapid dissemination of information and<lb/> reciprocal exchange in the urological field. We aimed to assess the activity, users and con-<lb/>tent of the online discussion, #KidneyStones, on Twitter. Methods<lb/> We investigated the Symplur Signals analytics tool for Twitter data distributed via the #Kid-<lb/>neyStones hashtag over a one year period. Activity analysis reflected overall activity and<lb/> tweet enhancements. We assessed users&apos; geolocations and performed an influencer analy-<lb/>sis. Content analysis included the most frequently used words, tweet sentiment and shares<lb/> for top tweets. Results<lb/> 3,426 users generated over 10,333 tweets, which were frequently accompanied by links<lb/> (49%), mentions (30%) and photos (13%). Users came from 106 countries across the globe<lb/> and were most frequently from North America (63%) and Europe (16%). Individual and<lb/> organisational healthcare professionals made up 56% of the influencers of the Twitter dis-<lb/>cussion on #KidneyStones. Besides the words &apos;kidney&apos; (used 4,045 times) and &apos;stones&apos;<lb/> (3,335), &apos;pain&apos; (1,233), &apos;urine&apos; (1,158), and &apos;risk&apos; (1,023) were the most frequently used<lb/> words. 56% of tweets had a positive sentiment. The median (range) number of shares was<lb/> 85 (62-587) for the top 10 links, 45.5 (17-94) for the top 10 photos, and 44 (22-95) for the<lb/> top 10 retweets.<lb/></div>
