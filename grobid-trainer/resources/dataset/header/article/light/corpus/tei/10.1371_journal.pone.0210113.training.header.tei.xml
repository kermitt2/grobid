	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Many Canadians experience unequal access to primary care services, despite living in a<lb/> country with a universal health care system. Health inequalities affect all Canadians but<lb/> have a much stronger impact on the health of vulnerable populations. Health inequalities<lb/> are preventable differences in the health status or distribution of health resources as experi-<lb/>enced by vulnerable populations. A geospatial approach was applied to examine how<lb/> closely the distribution of primary care providers (PCPs) in London, Ontario meet the needs<lb/> of vulnerable populations, including people with low income status, seniors, lone parents,<lb/> and linguistic minorities. Using enhanced two step floating catchment area (E2SFCA)<lb/> method, an index of geographic access scores for all PCPs and PCPs speaking French,<lb/> Arabic, and Spanish were separately developed at the dissemination area (DA) level. To<lb/> analyze how PCPs are distributed, comparative analyses were performed in association<lb/> with specific vulnerable groups. Geographical accessibility to all PCPs, and PCPs who<lb/> speak specific minority languages vary considerably across the city of London. Access<lb/> scores for French-and Arabic-speaking PCPs are found comparatively high (mean = 2.85<lb/> and 1.01 respectively) as compared to Spanish-speaking PCPs (mean = 0.47). Additionally,<lb/> many areas with high proportions of vulnerable populations experience low accessibility.<lb/> Despite its exploratory nature, this study offers insight into intra-urban distributions of geo-<lb/>graphical accessibility to primary care resources for vulnerable groups. These findings can<lb/> facilitate health researchers and policymakers in the development of recommendations to<lb/> increase levels of accessibility of specific population groups in underserved areas.<lb/></div>
