	Abstract:
	<div type="abstract">In this chapter, we examine the issue of digital formats for document encoding,<lb/> archiving and publishing, through the specific example of &quot;born-digital&quot; scholarly journal<lb/> articles. This small area of electronic publishing represents a microcosm of the state of<lb/> the art, and provides a good basis for this discussion. We will begin by looking at the<lb/> traditional workflow of journal editing and publication, and how these practices have<lb/> made the transition into the online domain. We will examine the range of different file<lb/> formats in which electronic articles are currently stored and published. We will argue<lb/> strongly that, despite the prevalence of binary and proprietary formats such as PDF and<lb/> MS Word, XML is a far superior encoding choice for journal articles. Next, we look at<lb/> the range of XML document structures (DTDs, Schemas) which are in common use for<lb/> encoding journal articles, and consider some of their strengths and weaknesses. We will<lb/> suggest that, despite the existence of specialized schemas intended specifically for journal<lb/> articles (such as NLM), and more broadly-used publication-oriented schemas such as<lb/> DocBook, there are strong arguments in favour of developing a subset or customization<lb/> of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) schema for the purpose of journal-article encoding;<lb/> TEI is already in use in a number of journal publication projects, and the scale and<lb/> precision of the TEI tagset makes it particularly appropriate for encoding scholarly<lb/> articles. We will outline the document structure of a TEI-encoded journal article, and look<lb/> in detail at suggested markup patterns for specific features of journal articles. Next, we<lb/> will look briefly at how XML-based publication systems work, and what advantages they<lb/> bring over electronic publication methods based on other digital formats.<lb/></div>
