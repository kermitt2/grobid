	<div type="abstract">Long-lived individuals, such as centenarians, may harbor genetic or environmental advantages<lb/> important for healthy aging. Populations with high prevalence of such individuals offer fertile<lb/> ground for such research. However, precise phenotypes are required, particularly accurate age.<lb/> Okinawa has among the world&apos;s highest reported prevalence of centenarians but, despite ex-<lb/>tensive study, no systematic validation of centenarian prevalence has been published. Therefore,<lb/> we performed comprehensive age validation of a subset (8%) of the total centenarian population<lb/> and assessed the reliability of the age registration system. Self-reported age was validated with<lb/> several common methods and found to correlate well with documented age. Demographic<lb/> methods, including assessment of age heaping, maximum age at death, centenarian proportions,<lb/> and male to female ratios of centenarians indicate that the age registration system is reliable. We<lb/> conclude that the high reported centenarian prevalence in Okinawa is valid and warrants further<lb/> study for its genetic and environmental correlates.<lb/></div>
