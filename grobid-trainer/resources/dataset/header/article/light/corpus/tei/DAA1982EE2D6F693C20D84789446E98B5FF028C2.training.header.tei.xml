	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Pay, benefits, perquisites, the work environment and the intrinsic<lb/> rewards that it offers, all need to be used to attract the executive<lb/> a library needs and wants. To that end, this article provides an<lb/> overview of current practices in library executive compensation,<lb/> with an explanation of various approaches and the provision of<lb/> ideas for compensation components. This is especially pertinent,<lb/> as nearly 60 percent of professional librarians will retire,<lb/> including a large number of library executives, during the next<lb/> ten to 15 years. Other fields and professions face similarly large<lb/> numbers of retirements. The competition for top-quality library<lb/> executives will be fierce. Both library executives and libraries<lb/> hiring new executives need to be aware of the variety of<lb/> compensation approaches available to them.<lb/></div>
