	2 ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Instrumental variable analysis, for example with physicians&apos; prescribing preferences as an<lb/> instrument for medications issued in primary care, is an increasingly popular method in the field of<lb/> pharmacoepidemiology. Existing power calculators for studies using instrumental variable analysis, such as<lb/> Mendelian randomisation power calculators, do not allow for the structure of research questions in this<lb/> field. This is because the analysis in pharmacoepidemiology will typically have stronger instruments and<lb/> detect larger causal effects than in other fields. Consequently, there is a need for dedicated power<lb/> calculators for pharmacoepidemiological research.<lb/> Methods and results: The formula for calculating the power of a study using instrumental variable analysis<lb/> in the context of pharmacoepidemiology is derived before being validated by a simulation study. The<lb/> formula is applicable for studies using a single binary instrument to analyse the causal effect of a binary<lb/> exposure on a continuous outcome. A web application is provided for the implementation of the formula<lb/> by others.<lb/> Conclusions: The statistical power of instrumental variable analysis in pharmacoepidemiological studies to<lb/> detect a clinically meaningful treatment effect is an important consideration. Research questions in this<lb/> field have distinct structures that must be accounted for when calculating power.<lb/></div>
