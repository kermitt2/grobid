	Abstract:<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The present study investigates the quality of surface sediments from the Bizerte lagoon (North Tunisia) using an<lb/> integrated approach including chemical contaminant analysis, bioassays and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs).<lb/> Sediment samples were collected at 9 sites and analyzed for eight heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Fe<lb/> and Mn). PAHs, PCBs, OCPs were measured previously in the same sediment samples. Our results indicated<lb/> that the highest concentrations of metals were found near urban areas due to the municipial and industrial<lb/> wastewater discharges. Sediment pollution assessment was carried out using geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and<lb/> enrichment factor (EF), which indicate a widespread pollution by Cd, Pb, Ni and Zn in the studied sediments.<lb/> For bioassays, aqueous and organic extracts were used to assess toxicity and genotoxicity in sediments by using<lb/> Microtox ® and SOS Chromotest, respectively. Toxicity levels were compared to metallic and organic pollutants<lb/> contents. Our results highlight differences in the pattern of responses between the different assays and show no<lb/> correlation with all the studied contaminants, emphasizing the influence of other contaminants not analyzed in<lb/> the present study. Based on SQGs, the results of toxicity assessment indicated that adverse effects caused by Ni<lb/> and Zn would be expected frequently. Nickel was found to have the highest predicted acute toxicity, followed by<lb/> Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu and Cr. There was no significant relationship between sediment toxicity calculated from heavy<lb/> metal concentrations (SQG approach) and those measured with bioassays. These findings support the use of<lb/> integrated approachs for evaluating the environmental risks of sediments.<lb/></div>
