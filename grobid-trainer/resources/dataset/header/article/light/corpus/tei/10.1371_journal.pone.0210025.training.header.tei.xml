	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.), the second most cultivated millet species, is<lb/> well adapted to diverse environments and remains an important cereal food and forage crop<lb/> in arid and semiarid regions worldwide. A symbolic crop for indigenous Austronesian peo-<lb/>ples, foxtail millet has been cultivated in Taiwan for more than 5,000 years, and landraces<lb/> reflect diversifying selection for various food applications. A total of 124 accessions col-<lb/>lected within Taiwan were assessed for Wx genotypes. Four identified Wx alleles, I, III, IV,<lb/> and IX were caused by insertion of various transposable elements (TEs) and resulted in<lb/> endosperm with non-waxy, low amylose content (AC), and waxy, respectively. A total of<lb/> 16.9%, 4.0%, 49.2%, and 29.8% of accessions were classified as type I, III, IV, and IX,<lb/> respectively; approximately half of the accessions belonged to the waxy type, indicating that<lb/> glutinous grains were favored for making traditional food and wine. The TE insertion affected<lb/> splicing efficiency rather than accuracy, leading to significantly reduced expression of wx in<lb/> types III, IV, and IX, although their transcripts were the same as wild-type, type I. Conse-<lb/>quently, the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) contents of the three mutated geno-<lb/>types were relatively low, leading to waxy or low AC endosperm, and the Wx genotypes<lb/> could explain 78% of variance in AC. The geographic distribution of Wx genotypes are asso-<lb/>ciated with culinary preferences and migration routes of Taiwanese indigenous peoples-in<lb/> particular, the genotype of landraces collected from Orchid Island was distinct from those<lb/> from Taiwan Island. This information on the major gene regulating starch biosynthesis in<lb/> foxtail millet endosperm can be applied to breeding programs for grain quality, and contrib-<lb/>utes to knowledge of Austronesian cultures.<lb/></div>
