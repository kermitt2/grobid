	<div type="abstract">Background: Conveying instructions is an everyday use of language, and gestures are<lb/> likely to be a key feature of this. Although co-speech iconic gestures are tightly<lb/> integrated with language, and people with aphasia (PWA) produce procedural dis-<lb/>courses impaired at a linguistic level, no previous studies have investigated how PWA<lb/> use co-speech iconic gestures in these contexts.<lb/> Aims: This study investigated how PWA communicated meaning using gesture and<lb/> language in procedural discourses, compared with neurologically healthy people<lb/> (NHP). We aimed to identify the relative relationship of gesture and speech, in the<lb/> context of impaired language, both overall and in individual events.<lb/> Methods &amp; Procedures: Twenty-nine PWA and 29 NHP produced two procedural<lb/> discourses. The structure and semantic content of language of the whole discourses were<lb/> analysed through predicate argument structure and spatial motor terms, and gestures were<lb/> analysed for frequency and semantic form. Gesture and language were analysed in two key<lb/> events, to determine the relative information presented in each modality.<lb/> Outcomes &amp; Results: PWA and NHP used similar frequencies and forms of gestures,<lb/> although PWA used syntactically simpler language and fewer spatial words. This<lb/> meant, overall, relatively more information was present in PWA gesture. This finding<lb/> was also reflected in the key events, where PWA used gestures conveying rich<lb/> semantic information alongside semantically impoverished language more often than<lb/> NHP.<lb/> Conclusions: PWA gestures, containing semantic information omitted from the con-<lb/>current speech, may help listeners with meaning when language is impaired. This<lb/> finding indicates gesture should be included in clinical assessments of meaning-<lb/>making.<lb/></div>
