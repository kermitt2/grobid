	<div type="abstract">Monocytes are amongst the first cells recruited into the brain after traumatic brain<lb/> injury (TBI). We have shown monocyte depletion 24 hours prior to TBI reduces brain<lb/> edema, decreases neutrophil infiltration and improves behavioral outcomes. Additionally,<lb/> both lesion and ventricle size correlate with poor neurologic outcome after TBI. Therefore,<lb/> we aimed to determine the association between monocyte infiltration, lesion size, and<lb/> ventricle volume. We hypothesized that monocyte depletion would attenuate lesion size,<lb/> decrease ventricle enlargement, and preserve white matter in mice after TBI. C57BL/6<lb/> mice underwent pan monocyte depletion via intravenous injection of liposome-<lb/>encapsulated clodronate. Control mice were injected with liposome-encapsulated PBS.<lb/> TBI was induced via an open-head, controlled cortical impact. Mice were imaged using<lb/> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1, 7, and 14 days post-injury to evaluate<lb/> progression of lesion and to detect morphological changes associated with injury (3D T1-<lb/>weighted MRI) including regional alterations in white matter patterns (multi-direction<lb/> diffusion MRI). Lesion size and ventricle volume were measured using semi-automatic<lb/> segmentation and active contour methods with the software program ITK-SNAP. Data<lb/> was analyzed with the statistical software program PRISM. No significant effect of<lb/> monocyte depletion on lesion size was detected using MRI following TBI (p=0.4).<lb/> However, progressive ventricle enlargement following TBI was observed to be attenuated<lb/> in the monocyte-depleted cohort (5.3 ± 0.9mm 3 ) as compared to the sham-depleted<lb/> cohort (13.2 ± 3.1mm 3 ; p=0.02). Global white matter integrity and regional patterns were<lb/> evaluated and quantified for each mouse after extracting fractional anisotropy maps from<lb/> the multi-direction diffusion-MRI data using Siemens Syngo DTI analysis package. 3<lb/> Fractional anisotropy values were preserved in the monocyte-depleted cohort (123.0 ±<lb/> 4.4mm 3 ) as compared to sham-depleted mice (94.9 ± 4.6mm 3 ; p=0.025) by 14 days post-<lb/>TBI. The MRI derived data suggests that monocyte depletion at the time of injury may be<lb/> a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of TBI. Furthermore, non-invasive<lb/> longitudinal imaging allows for the evaluation of both TBI progression as well as<lb/> therapeutic response over the course of injury.</div>
