	Abstract:<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Introduction:<lb/>Cases of injection drug use-related infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) requiring surgery are<lb/> rising in the setting of the current U.S. opioid epidemic. We thus aimed to determine the nature<lb/> of addiction interventions in the perioperative period.<lb/> Methods:<lb/> This is a retrospective review of surgical IDU-IE from 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary care<lb/> center in New Haven, Connecticut. The data collected included substances consumed<lb/> recreationally, consultations by social work (SW), psychiatry, pharmacotherapy for addiction,<lb/> and evidence of enrollment in a drug rehabilitation program upon discharge.<lb/> Among patients with active drug use (ADU), we compared the 24-month survival of<lb/> those who received at least one form of addiction intervention to that of those who did not.<lb/> Results:<lb/> Forty-two patients (75%) had active drug use. Among them, 22 used heroin. Forty-one<lb/> patients (73.2%) saw SW, 17 (30.4%) saw psychiatry; 14 (25%) saw neither SW nor psychiatry.<lb/> Twenty-one patients (37.5%) received methadone, 6 (10.7%) received buprenorphine, 1<lb/> (0.02%) received naltrexone; 26 (46.4%) did not receive any pharmacotherapy. Fifteen patients<lb/> (26.8%) attended a drug rehabilitation program, 13 (86.7%) of whom had seen SW and 8 (53%)<lb/> psychiatry. Among patients with ADU, there was no statistically significant difference in<lb/> survival between those who received at least one intervention and those who did not (p=0.1 by<lb/> log rank).<lb/> Conclusion:<lb/> Addiction interventions are deployed inconsistently for patients with surgical IDU-IE.<lb/> Untreated substance use disorder and recurrent endocarditis are the leading cause of death in this<lb/> population. Studying best-practices for perioperative interventions in IDU-IE and establishing<lb/> protocols are of the upmost importance.</div>
