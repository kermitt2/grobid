	<div type="abstract">The availability of low-cost computational power is a driving force behind the growing sophistication<lb/> of CAD software. Tools designed to reduce time-consuming build-test-redesign iterations are essential<lb/> for increasing engineering quality and productivity. However, automation of the design process poses<lb/> many di cult computational problems. As more downstream engineering activities are being considered<lb/> during the design phase, guaranteeing reasonable response times within design systems becomes prob-<lb/>lematic. Design is an interactive process and speed is a critical factor in systems that enable designers to<lb/> explore and experiment with alternative ideas during the design phase. Achieving interactivity requires<lb/> an increasingly sophisticated allocation of computational resources in order to perform realistic design<lb/> analyses and generate feedback in real time.<lb/> This paper presents our initial e orts to develop techniques to apply distributed algorithms to the<lb/> problem of recognizing machining features from solid models. Existing work on recognition of features<lb/> has focused exclusively on serial computer architectures. Our objective is to show that distributed<lb/> algorithms can be employed on realistic parts with large numbers of features and many geometric and<lb/> topological entities to obtain signi cant improvements in computation time using existing hardware and<lb/> software tools. Migrating solid modeling applications toward a distributed computing framework enables<lb/> interconnection of many of the autonomous and geographically diverse software tools used in the modern<lb/> manufacturing enterprise.<lb/> This has been implemented on a network of SUN workstations using the ACIS solid modeler and the<lb/> NIH C++ class library; inter-processor communication is handled with TCP/IP-based network commu-<lb/>nication tools.<lb/></div>
