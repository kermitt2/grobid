	<div type="abstract">Studies of superconductivity and flux pinning were carried out on (Bi 1.64 Pb 0.36 ͒Sr 2 Ca 1Ϫx Y x Cu 2 O 8ϩy<lb/> ͑xϭ0, 0.05, 0.11, 0.33͒ single crystals grown by the self-flux method. X-ray diffraction, transport,<lb/> and magnetic measurements were performed for purposes of characterization. X-ray analysis<lb/> revealed that the c lattice parameter systemically decreases as the Y doping level increases. The<lb/> superconducting transition temperature T c decreases from 80 to 30 K as x increases. A strong<lb/> annealing effect on T c and superconducting volume has been observed. Resistance measurements<lb/> show that xϭ0.33 samples are semiconductive over a wide temperature range between 4.2 and 300<lb/> K for the as-grown state, but become metallic with T c of 65-70 K after air or oxygen annealing.<lb/> Flux pinning was studied by measuring the hysteresis loop at different temperatures and different<lb/> fields. A peak effect was observed in all the codoped samples. Results show that at low<lb/> temperatures, the peak field is smaller than in solely Pb doped crystals and decreases as x increases<lb/> (xϾ0.1). However, the peak field at high temperature for the xϭ0.05 sample is higher than in<lb/> heavily Pb doped Bi2212 crystals, indicative of a strong pinning due to the codoping.</div>
