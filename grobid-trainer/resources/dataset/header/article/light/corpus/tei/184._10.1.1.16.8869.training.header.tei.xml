	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Plan recognition is the process of observing another agent&apos;s behavior(s) and inferring what, and<lb/> possibly why, the agent is acting as it is. Plan recognition becomes a very important means of acquiring<lb/> such information about other agents in situations and domains where explicit communication is either<lb/> very costly, dangerous, or impossible. Performing plan recognition in a physical domain (i.e. the real<lb/> world) forces the world&apos;s ubiquitous uncertainty upon the observing agent because of the necessity to<lb/> use real sensors to make the observations. We have developed a multiple resolution, hierarchical plan<lb/> recognition system to coordinate the motion of two interacting mobile robots. Uncertainty arises in the<lb/> system from dead reckoning errors that accumulate while the robots are moving, as well as by errors<lb/> in the computer vision system that is used to detect the other agent&apos;s behaviors. Based upon belief<lb/> networks, the plan recognition system gracefully degrades in performance as the level of uncertainty<lb/> about observations increase.<lb/></div>
