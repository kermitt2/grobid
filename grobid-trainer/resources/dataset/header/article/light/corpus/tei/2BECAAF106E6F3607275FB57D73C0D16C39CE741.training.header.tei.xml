	<div type="abstract">A 3-group reading-level design was used to investigate phonological<lb/> analysis, verbal working memory, and pseudoword reading performance in less skilled fourth-<lb/>grade readers. Children were given phonological oddity tasks assessing their sensitivity to sub-<lb/>syllabic and phonemic units, together with standardized tests of verbal working memory and<lb/> pseudoword reading. Less skilled fourth-grade readers performed lower than both chronological<lb/> age and reading-level controls on the phonological oddity and pseudoword reading tests. Less<lb/> skilled fourth-grade readers performed at the same level as skilled second-grade readers on a<lb/> test of verbal working memory. Skilled fourth-grade readers scored higher than both other groups<lb/> on this test. Correlational analyses were consistent with the view that phonological analysis skills<lb/> contribute more strongly than verbal working memory skills to children&apos;s decoding abilities.<lb/></div>
