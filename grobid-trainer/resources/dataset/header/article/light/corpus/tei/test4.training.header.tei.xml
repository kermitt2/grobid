	<div type="abstract">The transcription factor FOXM1 is upregulated and overexpressed in aggressive, therapy-resistant forms of hormone receptor-<lb/>positive and triple negative breast cancers, and is associated with less good patient survival. FOXM1 signaling is also a key driver in<lb/> many other cancers. Here, we identify a new class of compounds effective in suppressing FOXM1 activity in breast cancers, and<lb/> displaying good potency for antitumor efficacy. The compounds bind directly to FOXM1 and alter its proteolytic sensitivity, reduce<lb/> the cellular level of FOXM1 protein by a proteasome-dependent process, and suppress breast cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle<lb/> progression and increase apoptosis. RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analyses indicate that the compounds decrease expression<lb/> of FOXM1-regulated genes and suppress gene ontologies under FOXM1 regulation. Several compounds have favorable<lb/> pharmacokinetic properties and show good tumor suppression in preclinical breast tumor models. These compounds may be<lb/> suitable for further clinical evaluation in targeting aggressive breast cancers driven by FOXM1.<lb/></div>
