			<div type="abstract">Background: Obesity and weight gain are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease in Western countries.<lb/> However, their impact is not well elucidated in Asia, where body mass index (BMI) levels are generally lower than in Western<lb/> countries. We examined associations of BMI (kg/m 2 ) and weight change with risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese people.<lb/> Methods and results: A total of 43 235 men and 47 444 women aged 40–69 years living in communities were followed up from<lb/> 1990 to 2001 in the Japan Public Health Center-based (JPHC) prospective study . During 879 619 person-years of follow-up, we<lb/> documented 399 cases of coronary heart disease (334 myocardial infarction and 65 sudden cardiac death) for men and 119 (95<lb/> myocardial infarction and 24 sudden cardiac death) for women. Compared with persons with BMI 23.0–24.9, men, but not<lb/> women, with BMI X30.0 had higher risk of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction; the multivariable relative risks for<lb/> men were 1.8 (1.1–3.0) and 1.9 (1.1–3.2), respectively. When weight change was examined according to BMI at age 20 years,<lb/> men with initial BMI o21.7 who gained more than 10 kg compared with men of no weight change had a twofold higher risk of<lb/> coronary heart disease. Both men and women with initial BMI X21.7 showed no association between weight loss and the risk.<lb/> Conclusions: High BMI was associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease among men. Also, weight gain was<lb/> associated with increased risk among lean men.<lb/> </div>
