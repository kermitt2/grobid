	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">This article studies the following question: \When is it possible to decide, on the ba-<lb/>sis of images of point features observed by an imprecisely modeled two-camera stereo<lb/> vision system, whether or not a prescribed robot positioning task has been accom-<lb/>plished with precision?&quot; It is shown that for a stereo vision system with known epipo-<lb/>lar geometry, whether or not such a positioning task has been accomplished can be<lb/> decided with available data, just in case the task function which speci es the task is a<lb/> projective invariant.<lb/></div>
