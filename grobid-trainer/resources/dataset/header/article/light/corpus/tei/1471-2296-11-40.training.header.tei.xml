	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Sexual problems are common among people with coronary heart disease and can adversely affect<lb/> patients&apos; quality of life. GPs are ideally placed to deal with these problems. Research suggests that GPs are reluctant to<lb/> address sexual problems but little is known about what currently takes place in practice. The aim of this study was to<lb/> examine GPs&apos; self-reported behaviour and attitudes to discussing sexual problems with people with coronary heart<lb/> disease.<lb/> Method: Design: A cross-sectional survey which administered 230 postal questionnaires to a nationally representative,<lb/> stratified random sample of GPs in the Republic of Ireland. GPs were asked about current practice, knowledge,<lb/> awareness and confidence in dealing with sexual problems, barriers to addressing sexual problems, and about<lb/> improving services in this area.<lb/> Results: Responses were available for 61 GPs (27% response rate). Seventy percent of GPs reported that they rarely or<lb/> never discussed sexual problems with coronary patients. While all GPs believed addressing sexual problems was<lb/> important, many GPs reported lacking awareness, knowledge and confidence in addressing sexual problems. The main<lb/> barriers were lack of time, feeling the patient wasn&apos;t ready and lack of training in the area. GPs wanted more training<lb/> and guidelines for practice.<lb/> Conclusions: There is currently no standardised protocol for GPs for dealing with sexual problems among coronary<lb/> patients. Awareness of these issues appears to be low among GPs. Services could be improved by developing practice<lb/> guidelines for brief, effective actions or assessments, providing training in the area and improving information<lb/> resources and support services for referral.<lb/></div>
