	Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Objectives<lb/>The objectives of this study were to determine incidence and risk factors of glucose intoler-<lb/>ance one year after delivery in a sub-cohort of Riyadh Mother and Baby Cohort Study<lb/> (RAHMA) study. Methods<lb/> This is a follow-up study of a sub-cohort from RAHMA study from King Khalid University<lb/> Hospital (KKUH). All women from RAHMA database who completed one year since delivery<lb/> at KKUH were contacted by phone to participate in the study. Previously collected data from<lb/> RAHMA registry for each participant were linked to this study data. Clinical data measured<lb/> for each participant included current weight and height to calculate the BMI and waist cir-<lb/>cumference. Blood tests done for each participant were fasting blood glucose (FPG) and<lb/> HbA1c. Based on the blood tests results, participants were classified into three groups; dia-<lb/>betic, pre-diabetic and normal. The incidence of diabetes and prediabetes was calculated<lb/> for the whole cohort. Clinical, biochemical, and sociodemographic predictors of glucose<lb/> intolerance were compared between the three groups. Risk factors with P-value less than<lb/> 0.05 were tested in multivariate regression model with bootstrapping to calculate the relative<lb/> risk (RR) and its 95% Bias corrected Confidence Interval (C.I.) Results<lb/> From the sub-cohort, 407 women fulfilled the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate in<lb/> the study. From the study participants; 250 (61.4%) women were normoglycemic, 142<lb/> (35%) women had prediabetes and 15 (3.6%) women were diabetic. Following multivariable<lb/> regression analysis only history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), (RR 1.74, 95% CI<lb/></div>

Conclusion<lb/> The incidence of postpartum glucose intolerance (diabetes and prediabetes) is very high in<lb/> Saudi women. Both GDM and obesity are strong predictors of glucose intolerance.<lb/> The funders had no role in study design, data<lb/> collection, data analysis, decision to publish or<lb/> preparation of the manuscript.<lb/></div>
