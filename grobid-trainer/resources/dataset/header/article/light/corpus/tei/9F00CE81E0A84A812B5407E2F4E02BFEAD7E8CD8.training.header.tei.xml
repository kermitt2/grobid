	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">During grazing of the copepod Temora Iongicomis on Thalassiosira eccentrica phaeophorbide-a and<lb/> several phaeophytins-a appeared in the culture vessels. However, a variable portion of the diatom&apos;s<lb/> chlorophyll-a was degraded to substances that could not be detected either spectrophotometrically or<lb/> fluorometrically. Chlorophyll-cand fucoxanthin were also lost during diatom cell transit through Temora&apos;s gut.<lb/> The variability between experiments in the destruction of chl.a to colourless residues is ascribed to differences<lb/> in coprophagy and in transit time through the copepod gut, processes related to filtering rate and the ambient<lb/> food concentration. Because the pigment loss is variable, grazing pressure cannot be estimated by simply<lb/> recording bulk phaeopigment concentrations. The net result of the appearance of a fucoxanthinol-tike pigment<lb/> while all other pigments disappeared is a gradual carotenoid enrichment of the samples during grazing. </div>
