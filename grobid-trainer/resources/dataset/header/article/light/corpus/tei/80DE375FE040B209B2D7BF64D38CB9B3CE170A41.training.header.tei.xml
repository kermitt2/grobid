	<div type="abstract">Hedging rule policies for reservoir operations accept small deficits in current supply to<lb/> reduce the probability of a severe water shortage later. This paper expands a theoretical<lb/> analysis and develops a conceptual two-period model for reservoir operation with hedging<lb/> that includes uncertain future reservoir inflow explicitly. Extended analysis of the<lb/> model properties and influencing factors is presented with a general utility function,<lb/> addressing (1) the starting and ending water availability for hedging, (2) the range of<lb/> hedging that is related to water demand levels, (3) inflow uncertainty, and (4) evaporation<lb/> loss. Some intuitive knowledge on reservoir operation is proved or reconfirmed<lb/> analytically; and new knowledge is derived. This theoretical analysis provides an updated<lb/> basis for further theoretical study, and the theoretical findings can be used to improve<lb/> numerical modeling for reservoir operation.<lb/></div>
