	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">This report presents an empirical evaluation of four algorithms for automatically extracting<lb/> keywords and keyphrases from documents. The four algorithms are compared using five dif-<lb/>ferent collections of documents. For each document, we have a target set of keyphrases, which<lb/> were generated by hand. The target keyphrases were generated for human readers; they were<lb/> not tailored for any of the four keyphrase extraction algorithms. Each of the algorithms was<lb/> evaluated by the degree to which the algorithm&apos;s keyphrases matched the manually generated<lb/> keyphrases. The four algorithms were (1) the AutoSummarize feature in Microsoft&apos;s Word 97,<lb/> (2) an algorithm based on Eric Brill&apos;s part-of-speech tagger, (3) the Summarize feature in Ver-<lb/>ity&apos;s Search 97, and (4) NRC&apos;s Extractor algorithm. For all five document collections, NRC&apos;s<lb/> Extractor yields the best match with the manually generated keyphrases. 1<lb/> </div>
