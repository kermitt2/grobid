	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and cockles (Cerastoderma edule) were collected in the Oosterschelde<lb/> estuary (SW Netherlands) and exposed to diets consisting of the diatom Phaeodactyfum tricomutum and silt.<lb/> Algal concentrations were kept constant (20.103 cells.m1-1), and silt concentrations were varied between 3-80<lb/> mg.1-1 (mussel experiments) and 20-120 mg.1-1 (cockle experiments). Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the<lb/> pseudofaeces were reduced compared to the diets, indicating selective ingestion of the algae.It was estimated<lb/> that the mussels increase the ingestion of chlorophyll-a 2.0 times, and the cockles increase the chlorophyll-a<lb/> ingestion 2.8 times, compared to the ingestion rate without selection. The selection coefficients were not<lb/> affected by the SPM concentrations used. Phaeophytin-a concentrations in the faeces showed an increase as a<lb/> consequence of the digestion of the ingested algae. Digestive efficiencies of chlorophyll-a varied between<lb/> 36-92% The digestive efficiencies decreased with increasing SPM concentrations. </div>
