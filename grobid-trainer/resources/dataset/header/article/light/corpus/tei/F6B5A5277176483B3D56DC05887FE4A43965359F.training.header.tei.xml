	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND<lb/> To our knowledge, there are no reported arteriovenous<lb/> malformation (AVM) series in which detailed long-term<lb/> follow-up results after radiosurgery were described<lb/> based on the whole patient group. METHOD<lb/> We performed a detailed long-term follow-up study of 53<lb/> patients with cerebral AVMs treated with gamma knife<lb/> (GK) radiosurgery, with emphasis on radiation-related<lb/> adverse effects detected on neuro-imaging after a long<lb/> post-irradiation latency period (3-10 years). The post-GK<lb/> follow-up period was 40 -232 months excluding two mor-<lb/>talities, the mean being 112 and the median being 111<lb/> months. RESULTS<lb/> Three patients (5.6%) have, as yet, refused all neuro-<lb/>imaging follow-up studies. Complete nidus obliteration<lb/> was confirmed angiographically in 32 patients (60.4%)<lb/> between 1 and 5 post-GK years. In the other 18 patients<lb/> (34%), despite significant nidus shrinkage being angio-<lb/>graphically demonstrated, complete obliteration was not<lb/> achieved during a 2-7 year follow-up period. There were<lb/> two mortalities, one AVM-related (massive re-bleeding<lb/> during the latency period) and the other angiography-<lb/>related. There were five radiation-related morbidities<lb/> (9.4%), three of which-hemi-Parkinson syndrome, hemi-<lb/>paresis, and visual field disturbances attributable to de-<lb/>layed cyst formation-manifested at 5.5, 7 and 7 post-GK<lb/> years, respectively. We also experienced five patients<lb/> (9.4%) in whom, despite remaining asymptomatic to date,<lb/> radiation-related adverse effects were seen on neuro-<lb/>imaging: middle cerebral artery stenosis at 3 post-GK<lb/> years in one patient; dural arteriovenous fistula at 7 post<lb/> GK-years in one; delayed cyst formation in two, at 5 and<lb/> 10 post-GK years; and a small cavitation at 9 post-GK<lb/> years. CONCLUSION<lb/> Long-term follow-up, particularly with neuro-imaging mo-<lb/>dalities, is essential even after the &quot;treatment goal&quot; has<lb/> been attained.</div>
