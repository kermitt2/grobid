	<div type="abstract">he purpose of this study was to evaluate morphological characteristics of teeth with hypercementosis that are relevant to endodontic<lb/> practice. Twenty-eight extracted teeth with hypercementosis had their root apexes analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).<lb/> The teeth were divided according to tooth groups and type of hypercementosis. The following aspects were examined under SEM:<lb/> the contour and regularity of the root surface; presence of resorption; presence and number of apical foramina, and the diameter of<lb/> the main foramen. The progression of club shape hypercementosis was directly associated with the presence of foramina and apical<lb/> foramen obstruction. Cases of focal hypercementosis presented foramina on the surface, even when sidelong located in the root.<lb/> Circular cementum hyperplasia form was present in 2 out of 3 residual roots, which was the highest proportion among the tooth<lb/> types. The detection of a large number of foramina in the apical third of teeth with hypercementosis or even the possible existence<lb/> of apical foramen obliteration contributes to understand the difficulties faced during endodontic treatment of these cases.<lb/></div>
