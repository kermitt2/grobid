	<div type="abstract">Background. Although several studies have investigated the association between cholesterol and dementia, few have<lb/> examined cholesterol and decline across cognitive domains. We examined serum total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)<lb/> cholesterol, total-to-HDL ratio, and trajectories across cognitive domains.<lb/> Methods. Participants were 436 community-residing women (70-79 years old) in the Women&apos;s Health and Aging<lb/> Study II; they were screened to be physically high-functioning and cognitively intact at baseline. Cognition and other<lb/> health-related variables were assessed at five intervals spanning 9 years. Cognitive assessments included Trail Making<lb/> Test Parts A (TMT-A) and B (TMT-B), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Purdue Pegboard, and Mini-Mental State<lb/> Examination (MMSE). The association between baseline levels of serum lipids and cognitive trajectories were evaluated<lb/> using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Covariates included age, education, race, vascular disease, serum<lb/> creatinine, depression, and lipid-lowering medications.<lb/> Results. In multivariate analyses, baseline higher total (p ¼ .02) and HDL (p ¼ .03) cholesterol were associated with<lb/> better performance on the Purdue Pegboard. Using clinical cholesterol cutoffs, baseline serum total cholesterol levels<lb/> .240 mg/dL were associated with the best performance (p ¼ .02). Baseline lipids were not associated with any other<lb/> cognitive tests; there were no Lipid 3 Time interactions.<lb/> Conclusion. Higher baseline serum lipid levels predicted better performance over time on a measure of motor speed,<lb/> but not memory or psychomotor or executive functioning in this population of elderly women. This association suggests<lb/> that peripheral cholesterol levels, measured in late-life, may not be a good predictor of subsequent cognitive decline.<lb/> Future research examining peripheral cholesterol over the life span and its relationship with cognition is needed.<lb/></div>
