	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	
	<div type="abstract">We present an analysis of a 40 ksec Chandra observation of the galaxy group AWM 5. It has a small<lb/> (∼ 8 kpc) dense cool core with a temperature of ∼ 1.2 keV and the temperature profile decreases<lb/> at larger radii, from ∼ 3.5 keV just outside the core to ∼ 2 keV at ∼ 300 kpc from the center.<lb/> The abundance distribution shows a &quot;hole&quot; in the central ∼ 10 kpc, where the temperature declines<lb/> sharply. An abundance of at least a few times solar is observed ∼ 15 − 20 kpc from the center. The<lb/> deprojected electron density profile shows a break in slope at ∼ 13 kpc and can be fit by two β-models,<lb/> with β = 0.72 +0.16<lb/> −0.11 and r c = 5.7 +1.8<lb/> −1.5 kpc, for the inner part, and β = 0.34 ± 0.01 and r c = 31.3 +5.8<lb/> −5.5<lb/> kpc, for the outer part. The mass fraction of hot gas is fairly flat in the center and increases for<lb/> r &gt; 30 kpc up to a maximum of ∼ 6.5% at r ∼ 380 kpc. The gas cooling time within the central<lb/> 30 kpc is smaller than a Hubble time, although the temperature only declines in the central ∼ 8<lb/> kpc region. This discrepancy suggests that an existing cooling core has been partially re-heated. In<lb/> particular, thermal conduction could have been a significant source of re-heating. In order for heating<lb/> due to conduction to balance cooling due to emission of X-rays, the conductivity must be suppressed<lb/> by a large factor (at least ∼ 100). Past AGN activity (still visible as a radio source in the center of<lb/> the group) is however the most likely source that re-heated the central regions of AWM 5. We also<lb/> studied the properties of the ram pressure stripped tail in the group member NGC 6265. This galaxy<lb/> is moving at M ≈ 3.4 +0.5<lb/> −0.6 (v ∼ 2300 km s −1 ) through the hot group gas. The physical length of the<lb/> tail is ∼ 42 kpc and its mass is 2.1 ± 0.2 × 10 9 M ⊙ .<lb/> </div>
