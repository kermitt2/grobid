	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The Fortran D language extends Fortran by permitting the user to specify the distribution of array variables<lb/> across the processors of a parallel computer system. This information can then be used by the compiler<lb/> to derive a multidimensional parallelization. For programs in which multidimensional arrays have been lin-<lb/>earized for optimal performance on vector processors, this strategy will not produce the best results because<lb/> in those programs Fortran D is limited to a one-dimensional parallelization, which yields less e cient com-<lb/>munication than multidimensional parallelization because of surface-to-volume e ects. This paper proposes<lb/> Fortran D extensions and associated compiler technology to support natural topology parallelization of ap-<lb/>plications&apos; codes with linearized arrays. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the improvement in<lb/> performance of this new approach over the performance of currently available methods such as Fortran D<lb/> and the PARTI inspector/executor strategy.</div>
