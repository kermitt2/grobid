	<div type="abstract">GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is an incretin released from<lb/> intestinal L-cells in response to food intake. Activation of the<lb/> GLP-1 receptor potentiates the synthesis and release of insulin<lb/> from pancreatic ␤-cells in a glucose-dependent manner. The<lb/> GLP-1 receptor belongs to class B of the G-protein-coupled recep-<lb/>tors, a subfamily characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular<lb/> ligand binding domain. Exendin-4 and GLP-1 are 50% identical,<lb/> and exendin-4 is a full agonist with similar affinity and potency for<lb/> the GLP-1 receptor. We recently solved the crystal structure of the<lb/> GLP-1 receptor extracellular domain in complex with the compet-<lb/>itive antagonist exendin-4(9 -39). Interestingly, the isolated extra-<lb/>cellular domain binds exendin-4 with much higher affinity than the<lb/> endogenous agonist GLP-1. Here, we have solved the crystal struc-<lb/>ture of the extracellular domain in complex with GLP-1 to 2.1 Å<lb/> resolution. The structure shows that important hydrophobic<lb/> ligand-receptor interactions are conserved in agonist-and antago-<lb/>nist-bound forms of the extracellular domain, but certain residues<lb/> in the ligand-binding site adopt a GLP-1-specific conformation.<lb/> GLP-1 is a kinked but continuous ␣-helix from Thr 13 to Val 33 when<lb/> bound to the extracellular domain. We supplemented the crystal<lb/> structure with site-directed mutagenesis to link the structural<lb/> information of the isolated extracellular domain with the bind-<lb/>ing properties of the full-length receptor. The data support the<lb/> existence of differences in the binding modes of GLP-1 and<lb/> exendin-4 on the full-length GLP-1 receptor.<lb/></div>
