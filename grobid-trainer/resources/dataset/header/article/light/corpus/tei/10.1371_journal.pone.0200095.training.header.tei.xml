	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Bats are highly diverse and ecologically valuable mammals. They serve as host to bacteria,<lb/> viruses and fungi that are either beneficial or harmful to its colony as well as to other groups<lb/> of cave organisms. The bacterial diversity of two bat guano samples, C1 and C2, from<lb/> Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan, Philippines were investigated using 16S rRNA gene<lb/> amplicon sequencing. V3-V4 hypervariable regions were amplified and then sequenced<lb/> using Illumina MiSeq 250 PE system. Reads were processed using Mothur and QIIME pipe-<lb/>lines and assigned 12,345 OTUs for C1 and 5,408 OTUs for C2. The most dominant OTUs<lb/> in C1 belong to the Proteobacteria (61.7%), Actinobacteria (19.4%), Bacteroidetes (4.2%),<lb/> Firmicutes (2.7%), Chloroflexi (2.5%), candidate phylum TM7 (2.3%) and Planctomycetes<lb/> (1.9%) while Proteobacteria (61.7%) and Actinobacteria (34.9%) dominated C2. Large pro-<lb/>portion of sequence reads mainly associated with unclassified bacteria indicated possible<lb/> occurrence of novel bacteria in both samples. XRF spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and<lb/> C2 guano revealed significant differences in the composition of both major and trace ele-<lb/>ments. C1 guano recorded high levels of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples<lb/> registered high concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn and Cr. Community structure of the samples<lb/> were compared with other published community profiling studies from Finland (SRR868695),<lb/> Meghalaya, Northeast India (SRR1793374) and Maharashtra State, India (CGS). Core<lb/> microbiome among samples were determined for comparison. Variations were observed<lb/> among previously studied guano samples and the Cabalyorisa Cave samples were attributed<lb/> to either bat sources or age of the guano. This is the first study on bacterial diversity of guano<lb/> in the Philippines through high-throughput sequencing.<lb/></div>
