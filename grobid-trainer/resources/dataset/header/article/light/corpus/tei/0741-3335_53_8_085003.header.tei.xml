			Abstract 
			<div type="abstract">It is well known that stabilization of the resistive wall mode (RWM) may allow<lb/> fusion power to be significantly increased for a given magnetic field in advanced<lb/> tokamak operation. The principle of stabilization of the RWM by rotation has<lb/> been established both experimentally and theoretically. Recent experimental<lb/> results have indicated stabilization of the RWM has been achieved with very<lb/> small levels of rotation using balanced neutral beam injection. The framework<lb/> of Connor et al (Connor et al 1988 Phys. Fluids 31 577) is used to develop<lb/> two ideal plasma analytic toroidal models where stepped pressure profiles and<lb/> careful ordering of terms are used to simplify the analysis. The first model has<lb/> one resonant layer in the plasma and two resistive walls and the second has<lb/> two resonant layers and one resistive wall. The RWM can be stabilized with<lb/> slow rotation (∼0.5% A, where A is the Alfvénic rotation frequency) of a<lb/> secondary resistive wall. A secordary rotating resistive wall can only stabilize<lb/> the plasma if a perfectly conducting wall at that location would stabilize the<lb/> plasma. Differential rotation in the plasma is investigated by rotating two<lb/> resonant layers in the plasma at different rates. It is found in this model that<lb/> differential rotation of the outer resonant surface can stabilize the RWM, with no<lb/> rotation required at the inner surface. However, stabilization is not possible with<lb/> the outer surface static and the inner surface rotating. Experimental rotation<lb/> profiles for balanced neutral beam shots have higher levels of rotation near the<lb/> plasma edge showing differential rotation between the outer surface and the<lb/> wall may be part of the RWM stabilization mechanism. .<lb/></div>
