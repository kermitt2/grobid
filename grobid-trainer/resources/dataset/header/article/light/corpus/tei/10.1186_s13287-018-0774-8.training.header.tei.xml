	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs) mediate their immunoregulatory and tissue repair functions<lb/> by secreting paracrine factors, including extracellular vesicles (EVs). In several animal models of human diseases,<lb/> MSC-EVs mimic the beneficial effects of MSCs. Influenza viruses cause annual outbreaks of acute respiratory illness<lb/> resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. Influenza viruses constantly evolve, thus generating drug-resistant<lb/> strains and rendering current vaccines less effective against the newly generated strains. Therefore, new therapies<lb/> that can control virus replication and the inflammatory response of the host are needed. The objective of this study<lb/> was to examine if MSC-EV treatment can attenuate influenza virus-induced acute lung injury in a preclinical model.<lb/> Methods: We isolated EVs from swine bone marrow-derived MSCs. Morphology of MSC-EVs was determined by<lb/> electron microscopy and expression of mesenchymal markers was examined by flow cytometry. Next, we examined<lb/> the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs in vitro in lung epithelial cells and anti-viral and immunomodulatory<lb/> properties in vivo in a pig model of influenza virus.<lb/> Results: MSC-EVs were isolated from MSC-conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation. MSC-EVs were round-shaped<lb/> and, similarly to MSCs, expressed mesenchymal markers and lacked the expression of swine leukocyte antigens I and II.<lb/> Incubation of PKH-26-labeled EVs with lung epithelial cells revealed that MSC-EVs incorporated into the epithelial cells.<lb/> Next, we examined the anti-influenza and anti-inflammatory properties of MSC-EVs. MSC-EVs inhibited the<lb/> hemagglutination activity of avian, swine, and human influenza viruses at concentrations of 1.25-5 μg/ml.<lb/> MSC-EVs inhibited influenza virus replication and virus-induced apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. The anti-<lb/>influenza activity of MSC-EVs was due to transfer of RNAs from EVs to epithelial cells since pre-incubation of<lb/> MSC-EVs with RNase enzyme abrogated the anti-influenza activity of MSC-EVs. In a pig model of influenza virus,<lb/> intratracheal administration of MSC-EVs 12 h after influenza virus infection significantly reduced virus shedding in the<lb/> nasal swabs, influenza virus replication in the lungs, and virus-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines in the<lb/> lungs of influenza-infected pigs. The histopathological findings revealed that MSC-EVs alleviated influenza virus-induced<lb/> lung lesions in pigs.<lb/></div>
