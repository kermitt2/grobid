	<div type="abstract">Object: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage triggers an intense inflammatory<lb/> response, which is suspected to increase the risk for secondary complications such as<lb/> delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). However, to date, the monitoring of the inflammatory<lb/> response to detect secondary complications such as DCI has not become part of the<lb/> clinical routine diagnostic. Here, we aim to illustrate the time courses of inflammatory<lb/> parameters after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and discuss the prob-<lb/>lems of inflammatory parameters as biomarkers but also their possible relevance for<lb/> deeper understanding of the pathophysiology after aSAH and sophisticated planning of<lb/> future studies.<lb/> Materials and methods: In this prospective cohort study, 109 patients with aSAH were<lb/> initially included, n = 28 patients had to be excluded. Serum and-if possible-cerebral<lb/> spinal fluid samples (n = 48) were retrieved at days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 after aSAH.<lb/> Samples were analyzed for leukocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) (serum sam-<lb/>ples only) as well as matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), intercellular adhesion molecule<lb/> 1 (ICAM1), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) [both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)<lb/> samples]. Time courses of the inflammatory parameters were displayed and related to<lb/> the occurrence of DCI.<lb/> results: We illustrate the time courses of leukocyte count, CRP, MMP9, ICAM1, and LIF<lb/> in patients&apos; serum samples from the first until the 14th day after aSAH. Time courses of<lb/> MMP9, ICAM1, and LIF in CSF samples are demonstrated. Furthermore, no significant<lb/> difference was shown relating the time courses to the occurrence of DCI.<lb/> conclusion: We estimate that the wide range of the measured values hampers their<lb/> interpretation and usage as a biomarker. However, understanding the inflammatory<lb/> response after aSAH and generating a multicenter database may facilitate further stud-<lb/>ies: realistic sample size calculations on the basis of a multicenter database will increase<lb/> the quality and clinical relevance of the acquired results.<lb/></div>
