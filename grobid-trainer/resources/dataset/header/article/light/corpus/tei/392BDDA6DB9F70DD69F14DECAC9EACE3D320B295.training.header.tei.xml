	ABSTRACT:
	<div type="abstract">This study compared qualitative aspects of problem solving among suicide<lb/> attempters, suicide ideators, and nonsuicidal patients. The subjects completed a suicidal<lb/> intent scale and a problem-solving task involving three dilemmas. Problem solving was<lb/> analyzed along eight qualitative categories: versatility of the various solutions, reliance<lb/> on self versus others, activity versus passivity, confrontation versus avoidance, relevance<lb/> of the solution to the problem, positive versus negative affect, reference to the future,<lb/> and extremity of the solution. The statistical analysis yielded differences among the<lb/> three groups. In general, the solutions of suicidal patients showed less versatility, more<lb/> avoidance, less relevance, more negative affect, and less reference to the future than<lb/> the solutions of the nonsuicidal patients. The suicide attempters and nonsuicidal patients<lb/> offered more active solutions than did the suicide ideators. Our findings emphasize the<lb/> importance of general coping styles, as well as energeticimotivational aspects and affective<lb/> aspects of the problem-solving process. Some applications to therapy are discussed.<lb/></div>
