	<div type="abstract">Diarrhea and fecal incontinence are common in critically ill patients and present a challenging problem in patient management.<lb/> The Flexi-Seal5 Fecal Management System is a device to divert the stools away from the patient, thus improving the care to patients<lb/> with fecal incontinence. There have been only few case reports describing the complications with the use of this device. Here, we<lb/> present a case of a 77-year-old woman who was admitted due to massive hematochezia while on anticoagulation. She was found to<lb/> have a large rectal ulcer caused by the Flexi-Seal device, used during the last hospital stay for fecal incontinence. Flexi-Seal device<lb/> can be effective for the management of incontinence; however, caution should be exercised during handling and pressure from the<lb/> retention balloon should be relieved periodically.<lb/></div>
