	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Humans often produce vocalizations for infants that differ from vocalizations for adults. Is this property common<lb/> across societies? The forms of infant-directed vocalizations may be shaped by their function in parent-infant com-<lb/>munication. If so, infant-directed song and speech should be differentiable from adult-directed song and speech on<lb/> the basis of their acoustic features, and this property should be relatively invariant across cultures. To test this<lb/> hypothesis, we built a corpus of 1,614 recordings of infant-and adult-directed singing and speech produced by 411<lb/> people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies. We studied the corpus in a massive online experiment<lb/> and in a series of acoustic analyses. Naïve listeners (N = 13,218) reliably identified infant-directed vocalizations as<lb/> infant-directed, and adult-directed speech (but not songs) as adult-directed, at rates far higher than chance. Ratings<lb/> of infant-directed song were the most accurate and the most consistent across all societies; infant-directed speech was<lb/> accurately identified on average, but inconsistently across societies. To determine the mechanisms underlying these<lb/> results, we extracted many acoustic features from each recording and identified those that most reliably characterize<lb/> infant-directed song and speech across cultures, via preregistered exploratory-confirmatory analyses and machine<lb/> classification. The features distinguishing infant-and adult-directed song and speech concerned pitch, rhythmic,<lb/> phonetic, and timbral attributes; a hypothesis-free classifier with cross-validation across societies reliably identified<lb/> all vocalization types, with highest accuracy for infant-directed song. Last, we isolated 12 acoustic features that<lb/> were predictive of perceived infant-directedness; of these, two pitch attributes (median F0 and its variability) were by<lb/> far the most explanatory. These findings demonstrate cross-cultural regularities in infant-directed vocalizations that<lb/> are suggestive of universality; moreover, infant-directed song appears to be more cross-culturally stereotyped than<lb/> infant-directed speech, informing hypotheses of the functions and evolution of both.<lb/></div>
