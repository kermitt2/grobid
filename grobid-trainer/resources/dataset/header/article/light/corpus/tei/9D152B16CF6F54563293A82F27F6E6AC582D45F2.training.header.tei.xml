	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">NORDINFO (The Nordic Council for Scientific Information) was<lb/> founded in 1977 after a long tradition of Nordic cooperation<lb/> within the research library field. The Council is responsible for<lb/> coordinating Nordic cooperative initiatives that can facilitate<lb/> access to scientific information. Prior to that, Nordic countries<lb/> developed a variety of cooperative forms: political, economic,<lb/> cultural and scientific. During its 20 years of operation,<lb/> NORDINFO has financed many experimental projects and<lb/> financially supported many conferences, seminars and smaller<lb/> projects with the general aim that these projects should have<lb/> benefit beyond each individual country. Projects included an<lb/> interface, which was to serve as a tool to search databases in<lb/> different countries and structured in different languages.<lb/> NORDINFO also financed Centres of Excellence where Nordic<lb/> expertise could be developed. NORDINFO operates on a<lb/> budget provided by the Nordic Council of Ministers and is<lb/> given a three-year contract based on strategy which must be<lb/> accepted by the board, consisting of one member from each<lb/> of the five countries that finance Nordic cooperation.<lb/></div>
