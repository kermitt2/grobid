	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background Presence at the same time of HBsAg and anti-HBs antibodies (HBsAg/Ab) is an entity<lb/> sometimes encountered in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers.<lb/> Objectives This study was designed to characterize such serological profiles and to assess the<lb/> reliability of serological marker quantification by three commercially available assays in this setting.<lb/> Study design Among 2578 CHB identified patients, 129 (5%) had an HBsAg/Ab profile as determined<lb/> by Abbott Architect. After exclusion of co-infections (HIV, HCV, HDV), HBV reactivation or HBIg<lb/> treatment, 101 samples from 62 patients were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs quantification using<lb/> Architect, DiaSorin Liaison-XL and Roche Modular-Cobas. Influence of genotype and HBsAg variants<lb/> was studied in 31 samples with HBV replication.<lb/> Results HBsAg detection was confirmed with the 3 techniques for 98% (n=99) of the samples while the<lb/> HBsAg/Ab profile was concordant between all techniques for 65% of them. The overall correlation<lb/> between the 3 HBsAg quantification techniques was good (r 2<lb/> : 0.94-0.97). The median HBsAg<lb/> concentration was comparable for the 99 samples whatever the used technique but a bias of -0.11<lb/> and 0.02 log IU/mL were noticed for DiaSorin and Roche compared to Abbott, respectively. Anti-HBs<lb/> quantifications were poorly correlated between techniques with major discrepancies observed.<lb/> Genotype and substitutions within the &quot;a&quot; determinant showed an impact on HBsAg quantification.<lb/> Conclusions The double HBsAg/Ab profile is not an analytical artifact and is confirmed on all<lb/> commercially available techniques. While such profile does not influence HBsAg quantification,<lb/> differences of HBsAg quantification were noticed according to HBV genotype or HBsAg variant.<lb/></div>
