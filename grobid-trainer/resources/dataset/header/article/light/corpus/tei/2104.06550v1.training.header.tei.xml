	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The exponential growth of the number of multihomed mobile devices is changing the way<lb/> how we can connect to the Internet. Our mobile devices are demanding for more network<lb/> resources, in terms of traffic volume and QoS requirements. Unfortunately, it is very hard to<lb/> a multihomed device to be simultaneously connected to the network through multiple links.<lb/> The current work enhances the network access of multihomed devices agnostically to the<lb/> deployed access technologies. This enhancement is achieved by using simultaneously all of<lb/> the mobile devices interfaces, and by routing each individual data flow through the most<lb/> convenient access technology. The proposed solution is only deployed at the network side<lb/> and it extends Proxy Mobile IPv6 with flow mobility in a completely transparent way to<lb/> mobile nodes. In fact, it gives particular attention to the handover mechanisms, by improving<lb/> the detection and attachment of nodes in the network, with the inclusion of the IEEE 802.21<lb/> standard in the solution. This provides the necessary implementation and integration details<lb/> to extend a network topology with femtocell devices. Each femtocell is equipped with<lb/> various network interfaces supporting a diverse set of access technologies. There is also a<lb/> decision entity that manages individually each data flow according to its QoS / QoE<lb/> requisites.<lb/> The proposed solution has been developed and extensively tested with a real prototype.<lb/> Evaluation results evidence that the overhead for using the solution is negligible as compared<lb/> to the offered advantages such as: the support of flow mobility, the fulfil of VoIP functional<lb/> requisites, the session continuity in spite of flows mobility, its low overhead, its high<lb/> scalability, and the complete transparency of the proposed solution to the user terminals.<lb/></div>
