	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The purpose of this article is to provide a scoping review of the current literature on group<lb/> flow. Based on the PRISMA-guidelines for systematic reviews, 26 publications were<lb/> identified that met the inclusion criteria. Publication analyses comprised an individual con-<lb/>sideration of each publication and a systematic, integrative synthesis of all publications.<lb/> Analyses identified heterogeneous group flow definitions across publications, supporting<lb/> the need for an integrative definition. Further heterogeneity existed in the theoretical<lb/> approaches and measures used, highlighting the need for a comprehensive theory and<lb/> a measurement standard. Components (e.g., synchronization), antecedents (e.g., trust),<lb/> and outcomes (e.g., well-being) of group flow were identified in publications that presented<lb/> empirical studies, some of which that showed similarities between characteristics of group<lb/> flow and individual flow and others that showed aspects unique to group flow. Overall, this<lb/> scoping review reveals the need for a systematic research program on group flow.<lb/></div>
