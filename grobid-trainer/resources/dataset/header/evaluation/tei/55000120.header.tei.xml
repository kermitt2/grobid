	<div type="abstract">Abstract: A bis-aniline-cross-linked Au nanoparticles (NPs) composite is electropolymerized on Au surfaces.<lb/> The association of trinitrotoluene, TNT, to the bis-aniline bridging units via π-donor-acceptor interactions<lb/> allows the amplified detection of TNT by following the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) reflectance changes<lb/> as a result of the coupling between the localized plasmon of the AuNPs and the surface plasmon wave<lb/> associated with the gold surface. The detection limit for analyzing TNT by this method is ∼10 pM. The<lb/> electropolymerization of the bis-aniline-cross-linked AuNPs composite in the presence of picric acid results<lb/> in a molecular-imprinted matrix for the enhanced binding of TNT. The imprinted AuNPs composite enabled<lb/> the sensing of TNT with a detection limit that corresponded to 10 fM. Analysis of the SPR reflectance<lb/> changes in the presence of different concentrations of TNT revealed a two-step calibration curve that included<lb/> the ultrasensitive detection of TNT by the imprinted sites in the composite, K ass<lb/> I . for the association of TNT<lb/> to the imprinted sites, 6.4 × 10<lb/> 12 M<lb/> -1 , followed by a less sensitive detection of TNT by the nonimprinted<lb/> π-donor bis-aniline sites (K ass.<lb/> NI<lb/> ) 3.9 × 10<lb/> 9 M<lb/> -1 ). The imprinted AuNPs composite reveals impressive<lb/> selectivity. The structural and functional features of the bis-aniline-cross-linked AuNPs composites were<lb/> characterized by different methods including ellipsometry, AFM, and electrochemical means. The dielectric<lb/> properties of the AuNPs composite in the presence of different concentrations of TNT were evaluated by<lb/> the theoretical fitting of the respective experimental SPR curves. The ultrasensitive detection of the TNT<lb/> by the AuNPs composite was attributed to the changes of the dielectric properties of the composite, as a<lb/> result of the formation of the π-donor-acceptor complexes between TNT and the bis-aniline units. These<lb/> changes in the dielectric properties lead to a change in the conductivity of the AuNPs matrix.<lb/></div>
