	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Two broadly known characteristics of germ cells in many organisms are their development as a<lb/> &apos;cyst&apos; of interconnected cells and their high sensitivity to DNA damage. Here we provide<lb/> evidence that these characteristics are linked, and that interconnectivity is a mechanism that<lb/> confers to the Drosophila testis a high sensitivity to DNA damage. We show that all germ cells<lb/> within a cyst die simultaneously even when only a subset of them exhibit detectable DNA<lb/> damage. Compromising connectivity results in cysts in which only a subset of germ cells die<lb/> upon DNA damage, lowering overall germ cell death. Our data indicate that a death-promoting<lb/> signal is shared through the intercellular connections of germ cells. Taken together, we propose<lb/> that intercellular connectivity is a mechanism that uniquely increases the sensitivity of the<lb/> germline to DNA damage, thereby protecting the integrity of gamete genomes that are passed on<lb/> to the next generation.</div>
