	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">IMPORTANCE Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a common illness with complex genetic architecture where<lb/> both common genetic variation and rare mutations have been implicated. SCZ candidate genes<lb/> participate in common molecular pathways that are regulated by activity-dependent changes in<lb/> neurons, including the signaling network that modulates synaptic strength and the network of genes<lb/> that are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein. One important next step is to further our<lb/> understanding on the role of activity-dependent changes of genes expression in the etiopathogenesis<lb/> of SCZ.<lb/> OBJECTIVE To examine whether neuronal activity-dependent changes of gene expression is<lb/> dysregulated in SCZ.<lb/> DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Neurons differentiated from human induced pluripotent<lb/> stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from 4 cases with SCZ and 4 unaffected controls were depolarized using<lb/> potassium chloride. RNA was extracted followed by genome-wide profiling of the transcriptome.<lb/> MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We performed differential expression analysis and gene co-<lb/>expression analysis to identify activity-dependent or disease-specific changes of the transcriptome.<lb/> Further, we used gene set analyses to identify co-expressed modules that are enriched for SCZ risk<lb/> genes.<lb/> RESULTS We identified 1,669 genes that are significantly different in SCZ-associated vs. control<lb/> hiPSC-derived neurons and 1,199 genes that are altered in these cells in response to depolarization.<lb/> We show that the effect of activity-dependent changes of gene expression in SCZ-associated<lb/> neurons is attenuated compared to controls. Furthermore, these differentially expressed genes are<lb/> co-expressed in modules that are highly enriched for genes affected by genetic risk variants in SCZ<lb/> and other neurodevelopmental disorders.<lb/> CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results show that SCZ candidate genes converge to gene<lb/> networks that are associated with a blunted effect of activity-dependent changes of gene expression<lb/> in SCZ-associated neurons. Overall, these findings show that hiPSC neurons demonstrate activity-<lb/>dependent transcriptional changes that can be utilized to examine underlying mechanisms and<lb/> therapeutic interventions related to SCZ.</div>
