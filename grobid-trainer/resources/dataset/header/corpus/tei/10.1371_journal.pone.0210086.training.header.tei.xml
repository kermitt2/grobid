	Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Introduction<lb/> Nutritional anemia is a major public health problem throughout the world, particularly in<lb/> developing countries. Iron with folic acid supplementation (IFAS) is recommended to miti-<lb/>gate anemia and its resulting complications during pregnancy. There has been limited study<lb/> on IFAS adherence of pregnant women in the study area. The aim of this study was to<lb/> assess adherence to IFAS and its associated factors among pregnant women attending<lb/> antenatal care service in Debre Tabor General Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods<lb/> An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 9 to April 8, 2017,<lb/> at Debre Tabor General Hospital. A total of 262 study participants were included and<lb/> selected by systematic random sampling. The entire interviewed questionnaire was<lb/> checked and entered into EpiData version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 20 for<lb/> windows for analysis. IFAS adherence status was defined as, if pregnant mothers took<lb/> 65% or more of the IFAS which is equivalent to taking IFAS at least 4 days a week during<lb/> the 1-month period preceding the study. Regressions were fitted to identify independent<lb/> predictors of IFAS adherence. A P-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical<lb/> significance. Results<lb/> A total of 241 pregnant women were included (92% response rate), of which 107 (44%)<lb/> were adherent to IFAS. Only 39% received IFAS counseling, and 52% had some knowledge<lb/> of IFAS. Gravidity (AOR = 2.92 95% CI (1.61, 5.30)), gestational age at first ANC visit (AOR<lb/> = 3.67, 95% CI (1.94, 6.97)), pregnant women who got advice about IFAS (AOR = 2.04,<lb/></div>

	<div type="abstract">95%CI (1.12, 3.75)), current anemia (AOR = 2.22, 95%CI (1.45, 4.29)), and had knowledge<lb/> about IFAS (AOR = 3.27, 95% CI (1.80, 5.95)) were statistically associated with adherence<lb/> to IFAS among pregnant women.
	Conclusion<lb/> Overall, IFAS adherence among pregnant women was low. The associated factors with<lb/> adherence of IFAS were counseling and knowledge, early ANC attendance, pregnancy his-<lb/>tory, and current anemia diagnosis. IFAS counseling by health workers was low but, when<lb/> given, was associated with improved IFAS adherence. Health workers and health extension<lb/> workers should consistently counsel on IFAS benefits during ANC visit, to improve IFAS<lb/> adherence during the current and subsequent pregnancies.</div>
