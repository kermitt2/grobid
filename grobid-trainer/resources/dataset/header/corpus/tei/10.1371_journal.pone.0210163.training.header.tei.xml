	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The increasing amount of clinical research conducted outside the &quot;traditional&quot; countries<lb/> raises questions about the benefits of hosting offshored clinical research. The extent to<lb/> which trials contribute to the scientific knowledge base and, in particular, whether there are<lb/> differences between different types of trials remain open questions. By examining a change<lb/> in clinical trial regulations in India, a country often viewed as a first-choice offshoring loca-<lb/>tion, we study how the relaxation of clinical trial regulations affects the number and the type<lb/> of clinical trials as well as the domestic scientific knowledge base. Based on trial data from<lb/> ClinicalTrials.gov and data on associated publication activities, our empirical analysis sug-<lb/>gests that, despite an initial increase in the number of clinical trials, relaxing clinical trial reg-<lb/>ulations has a limited impact on the domestic scientific knowledge base. More specifically,<lb/> the number of Indian researchers involved in the production of trial-related scientific knowl-<lb/>edge remains modest. Furthermore, the potential to learn from the additional trials appears<lb/> to be limited: the influx of phase 3 trials-mainly sponsored by Western-pharmaceutical<lb/> firms-is accompanied by a lower likelihood that the trial results will be used in Indian<lb/> researchers&apos; subsequent research activities when compared to phase 3 trials with preceding<lb/> phase 2 trials, as was required before the regulatory change. Overall, our results contradict<lb/> expectations that relaxing the regulatory requirements for conducting late-stage clinical tri-<lb/>als is an appropriate means of supporting the development of the domestic scientific knowl-<lb/>edge base.<lb/></div>
