	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The current system of so-called institutional repositories, even if it has been a sensible<lb/> response at an earlier stage, may not answer the needs of the scholarly community,<lb/> scientific communication and accompanied stakeholders in a sustainable way. However,<lb/> having a robust repository infrastructure is essential to academic work. Yet, current<lb/> institutional solutions, even when networked in a country or across Europe, have largely<lb/> failed to deliver. Consequently, a new path for a more robust infrastructure and larger<lb/> repositories is explored to create superior services that support the academy. A future<lb/> organisation of publication repositories is advocated that is based upon macroscopic<lb/> academic settings providing a critical mass of interest as well as organisational<lb/> coherence. Such a macro-unit may be geographical (a coherent national scheme),<lb/> institutional (a large research organisation or a consortium thereof) or thematic (a<lb/> specific research field organising itself in the domain of publication repositories).<lb/> The argument proceeds as follows: firstly, while institutional open access mandates<lb/> have brought some content into open access, the important mandates are those of the<lb/> funders and these are best supported by a single infrastructure and large repositories,<lb/> which incidentally enhances the value of the collection (while a transfer to institutional<lb/> repositories would diminish the value). Secondly, we compare and contrast a system<lb/> based on central research publication repositories with the notion of a network of<lb/> institutional repositories to illustrate that across central dimensions of any repository<lb/> solution the institutional model is more cumbersome and less likely to achieve a high<lb/> level of service. Next, three key functions of publication repositories are reconsidered,<lb/> namely a) the fast and wide dissemination of results; b) the preservation of the record;<lb/> and c) digital curation for dissemination and preservation. Fourth, repositories and their<lb/> ecologies are explored with the overriding aim of enhancing content and enhancing<lb/> usage. Fifth, a target scheme is sketched, including some examples. In closing, a look at<lb/> the evolutionary road ahead is offered.</div>
