		<div type="abstract">Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study of several policies for managing the effect <lb/>of delay jitter on the playout of audio and video in computer-based conferences. The problem <lb/>addressed is that of managing the fundamental tradeoff between display with low latency and <lb/>display with few gaps. We describe a particular policy called queue monitoring which <lb/>observes delay jitter over time and dynamically adjusts display latency in order to support <lb/>low-latency conferences with an acceptable gap rate. Queue monitoring is evaluated by <lb/>comparing it with two policies from the literature in a study based on measurements from a <lb/>computer-based conferencing system. Our results show that queue monitoring performs as <lb/>well or better than the other policies over the range of observed network loads. More <lb/>importantly, we show that queue monitoring performs better on those network loads for <lb/>which the other policies exhibit poor performance. <lb/></div>
