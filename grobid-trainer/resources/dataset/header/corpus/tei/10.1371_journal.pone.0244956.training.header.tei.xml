	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Constraints related to sample preparation are some of the primary obstacles to widespread<lb/> deployment of molecular diagnostics for rapid detection of trace quantities (�10 3 CFU/mL)<lb/> of food-borne pathogens. In this research, we report a sample preparation method using a<lb/> novel handheld electroflotation system to concentrate and recover dilute quantities<lb/> (10 2 −10 3 CFU/mL) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) 25922 in artificially contaminated samples for<lb/> reliable, rapid detection by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). To protect sus-<lb/>pended cells from shear stresses at bubble surfaces, a non-ionic surfactant (Pluronic-F68)<lb/> and flocculant (chitosan oligosaccharide) were used to aggregate cells and reduce their sur-<lb/>face hydrophobicity. Effective conditions for recovery were determined through multifacto-<lb/>rial experiments including various concentrations of Pluronic-F68 (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 g L -1 ),<lb/> chitosan oligosaccharide (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 g L -1 ), bacteria (10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 CFU/mL E. coli<lb/> 25922), recovery times (10, 15 and 20 minutes), and degrees of turbulent gas flux (&quot;high&quot;<lb/> and &quot;low&quot;). The automated electroflotation system was capable of concentrating effectively<lb/> all of the bacteria from a large sample (380 mL 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer containing<lb/> 10 2 CFU/mL E. coli) into a 1 mL recovered fraction in less than 30 minutes. This enabled<lb/> detection of bacterial contaminants within 2 hours of collecting the sample, without a special-<lb/>ized laboratory facility or traditional enrichment methods, with at least a 2-3 order of magni-<lb/>tude improvement in detection limit compared to direct assay with LAMP.<lb/></div>
