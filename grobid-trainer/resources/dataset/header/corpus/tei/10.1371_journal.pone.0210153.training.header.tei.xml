	(YHK) Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Background<lb/> Overweight is known as a risk factor for ischemic stroke. However, the effect of weight<lb/> change on the development of ischemic stroke remains controversial. We investigated the<lb/> relationship between weight change and the risk of ischemic stroke using a nationwide pop-<lb/>ulation-based cohort. Methods<lb/> Our study enrolled 11,084,683 participants (Mean age 49.7±13.5 years, range 20-114<lb/> years) in the Korean National Health Screening Program from 2009 to 2012. Weight change<lb/> was calculated using the difference between the baseline weight and the weight at health<lb/> screening four years prior to the baseline. The occurrence of newly-diagnosed ischemic<lb/> stroke was observed until the end of 2015. We categorized the study population according<lb/> to weight change and performed multivariable analysis to compare the risk. Results<lb/> Ischemic stroke was newly diagnosed in 113,591 subjects. The crude incidence rates of<lb/> ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years according to the change in body weight were 3.059,<lb/> 1.906, and 1.491 in the &lt;-5%, ±5%, and �+5% groups, respectively. After adjusting all vari-<lb/>ables, the hazard ratio (HR) of ischemic stroke was higher in subjects who underwent weight<lb/> loss (HR 1.152) or weight gain (HR 1.087) than in those who maintained their weight.

	<div type="abstract">analyzed by eight groups of 5% intervals, the risk showed a U-shaped curve with those who<lb/> maintained their weight showing the lowest risk. Conclusions<lb/> The risk of ischemic stroke was gradually increased in those who lost or gained more than<lb/> 5% of their weight over four years, after adjusting for confounders.
