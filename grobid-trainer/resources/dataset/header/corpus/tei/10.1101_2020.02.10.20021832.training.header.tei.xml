	3 Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict<lb/> the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients.<lb/> Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was<lb/> collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on<lb/> the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups<lb/> were analyzed.<lb/> Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two<lb/> groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%,<lb/> respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK<lb/> cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild<lb/> group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than<lb/> severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and<lb/> cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T,<lb/> IL-6 and IL-10.<lb/> Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels<lb/> were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for<lb/> predicting the transition from mild to severe. Large number of samples are still needed to confirm<lb/> the &quot;warning value&quot; of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10.<lb/></div>
