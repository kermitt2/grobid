	<div type="abstract">We mapped the hemagglutinin (HA) antigenic epitopes of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus on the<lb/> three-dimensional HA structure by characterizing escape mutants of a recombinant virus containing A/Viet-<lb/>nam/1203/04 (H5N1) ⌬HA and neuraminidase genes in the genetic background of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)<lb/> virus. The mutants were selected with a panel of eight anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), seven to<lb/> A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) virus and one to A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/8125/83 (H5N2) virus, and the mutants&apos;<lb/> HA genes were sequenced. The amino acid changes suggested three MAb groups: four MAbs reacted with the<lb/> complex epitope comprising parts of the antigenic site B of H3 HA and site Sa of H1 HA, two MAbs reacted<lb/> with the epitope corresponding to the antigenic site A in H3 HA, and two MAbs displayed unusual behavior:<lb/> each recognized amino acid changes at two widely separate antigenic sites. Five changes were detected in amino<lb/> acid residues not previously reported as changed in H5 escape mutants, and four others had substitutions not<lb/> previously described. The HA antigenic structure differs substantially between A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1)<lb/> virus and the low-pathogenic A/Mallard/Pennsylvania/10218/84 (H5N2) virus we previously characterized<lb/> (N. V. Kaverin et al., J. Gen. Virol. 83:2497-2505, 2002). The hemagglutination inhibition reactions of the<lb/> MAbs with recent highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses were consistent with the antigenic-site amino acid changes<lb/> but not with clades and subclades based on H5 phylogenetic analysis. These results provide information on the<lb/> recognition sites of the MAbs widely used to study H5N1 viruses and demonstrate the involvement of the HA<lb/> antigenic sites in the evolution of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, findings that can be critical for character-<lb/>izing pathogenesis and vaccine design.<lb/></div>
