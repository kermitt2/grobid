	<div type="abstract">Background: Body contouring surgery for the removal of the 11 th and 12 th ribs is undertaken for aesthetic appeal<lb/> in female and transgender populations. Th e potential adverse eff ects of the surgery on lung function and respira-<lb/>tory muscle strength have not been previously studied. Th erefore, this study aimed to determine the eff ects of<lb/> &apos; Ant-waist&apos; surgery on lung function and respiratory muscle strength in individuals who had undergone surgery.<lb/> Methods: Th is was a cross-sectional study with two groups, an Anti-waist group who had undergone surgery and<lb/> an age and gender matched control group. Participants performed lung function tests to determine measurements<lb/> of FEV 1 , FVC, FEV 1 /FVC, PEF, MIP, and MEP. Independent t-tests were performed to determine between-<lb/>group diff erences in outcomes and Pearson&apos;s correlation coeffi cients determined the relationship between lung<lb/> function and respiratory muscle strength, and number of years since surgery.<lb/> Results: Th ere was a signifi cant between-group diff erence in FEV 1 (-0.83; 95%CI -1.30, -0.36; p &lt; 0.001),<lb/> FEV 1 %pred. (-34.91; 95%CI -48.92, -20.90; p &lt; 0.001), FVC%pred. (-22.73; 95%CI -32.84, -12.62; p &lt; 0.001),<lb/> PEF%pred. (-44.18; 95%CI -61.52, -26.84; p &lt; 0.001) and MEP (-68.27; -102.48, -34.07; p &lt; 0.001). Th ere were<lb/> signifi cantly large, negative correlations (r &gt; 0.5) between the number of years after surgery and FEV 1 ( p = 0.002),<lb/> FEV 1 %pred. (p = 0.0001); and PEF%pred. (p = 0.032).<lb/> Conclusions: Th is study has identifi ed that aesthetic surgery for the removal of ribs 11 and 12 had a signifi cant<lb/> adverse eff ect on lung function and respiratory muscle strength in Jordanian females. Th e potential adverse eff ects<lb/> should be carefully explained by surgeons to patients considering the surgery.<lb/></div>
