	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Objectives. To investigate the stability of free and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in serum stored at<lb/> Ϫ20°C and Ϫ70°C for 2 years.<lb/> Methods. Fresh blood from 29 patients was drawn and allowed to clot at room temperature. Serum was<lb/> prepared by centrifugation 1 hour later and tested to determine the free and total PSA levels. Samples were<lb/> aliquoted, frozen at Ϫ20°C or Ϫ70°C, and monitored for long-term stability over the course of 2 years.<lb/> Results. On average, 91% of the free PSA, 92% of the total PSA, and 89% of the percent free PSA values<lb/> were recovered after 2 years of storage at Ϫ20°C; and 96% of the free PSA, 101% of the total PSA, and 95%<lb/> of the percent free PSA values were recovered after 2 years of storage at Ϫ70°C. Seventy percent of the<lb/> samples stored at Ϫ20°C and 100% of the samples stored at Ϫ70°C showed no statistically significant<lb/> decline in free PSA values over the 2-year period. Only one total PSA sample (Ϫ20°C) showed a statistically<lb/> significant loss after 2 years of storage.<lb/> Conclusions. Our results suggest that samples stored frozen for up to 2 years at Ϫ70°C should give<lb/> acceptable percent free PSA results. </div>
