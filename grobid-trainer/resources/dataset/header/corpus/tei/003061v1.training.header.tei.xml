	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The nuclear genome of every cell harbors millions of unoccupied transcription factor (TF)<lb/> recognition sequences that harbor methylated cytosines. Although DNA methylation is<lb/> commonly invoked as a repressive mechanism, the extent to which it actively silences<lb/> specific TF occupancy sites is unknown. To define the role of DNA methylation in modulating<lb/> TF binding, we quantified the effect of DNA methyltransferase abrogation on the occupancy<lb/> patterns of a ubiquitous TF capable of autonomous binding to its target sites in chromatin<lb/> (CTCF). Here we show that the vast majority of unoccupied, methylated CTCF recognition<lb/> sequences remain unbound upon depletion of DNA methylation. Rather, methylation--<lb/>regulated binding is restricted to a small fraction of elements that exhibit high intrinsic<lb/> variability in CTCF occupancy across cell types. Our results suggest that DNA methylation is<lb/> not a major groundskeeper of genomic transcription factor occupancy landscapes, but<lb/> rather a specialized mechanism for stabilizing epigenetically labile sites.</div>
