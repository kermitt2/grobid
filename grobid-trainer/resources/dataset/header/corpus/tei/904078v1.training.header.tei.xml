	2 ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">In this study we analyze the growth-phase dependent metabolic states of Bdellovibrio<lb/> bacteriovorus by constructing a fully compartmented, mass and charge-balanced genome-scale<lb/> metabolic model of this predatory bacterium (iCH457). Considering the differences between life<lb/> cycle phases driving the growth of this predator, growth-phase condition-specific models have<lb/> been generated allowing the systematic study of its metabolic capabilities. Using these<lb/> unprecedented computational tools, we have been able to analyze, from a system level, the<lb/> dynamic metabolism of the predatory bacteria as the life cycle progresses. We provide solid<lb/> computational evidences supporting potential axenic growth of B. bacteriovorus&apos;s in a rich<lb/> medium based its encoded metabolic capabilities. Our systems-level analysis confirms the<lb/> presence of &quot;energy-saving&quot; mechanisms in this predator as well as an abrupt metabolic shift<lb/> between the attack and intraperiplasmic growth phases. Our results strongly suggest that<lb/> predatory bacteria&apos;s metabolic networks have low robustness, likely hampering their ability to<lb/> tackle drastic environmental fluctuations, thus being confined to stable and predictable habitats.<lb/> Overall, we present here a valuable computational testbed based on predatory bacteria activity<lb/> for rational design of novel and controlled biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical applications.<lb/></div>

	AUTHOR SUMMARY<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Bacterial predation is an interspecific relationship widely extended in nature. Among other<lb/> predators, Bdellovibrio and like organism (BALOs) have received recently a great attention due<lb/> to the high potential applications such as biocontrol agent in medicine, agriculture, aquaculture<lb/> and water treatment. Despite the increasing interest in of this predatory bacterium its complex<lb/> lifestyle and growth conditions hamper the full exploitation of their biotechnological properties.<lb/> In order to overcome these important shortcomings, we provide here the first genome-scale<lb/> model of a predator bacterium constructed so far. By using the model as a computational<lb/> testbed, we provide solid evidences of the metabolic autonomy of this interesting bacterium in<lb/> term of growth, as well as its dynamic metabolism powering the biphasic life style of this<lb/> predator. We found a low metabolic robustness thus suggesting that Bdellovibrio is more niche-<lb/>specific than previously thought and that the environmental conditions governing predation may<lb/> be relatively uniform. Overall, we provide here a valuable computational tool largely facilitating<lb/> rational design of novel and controlled predator-based biocatalysts in biotechnological/clinical<lb/> applications. </div>
