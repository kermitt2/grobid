	Abstract.
	<div type="abstract">We make the first report that a metallic pyrochlore oxide Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 ,<lb/> exhibits type II superconductivity at 1.1 K. The pyrochlore oxide is known to be<lb/> a geometrical frustrated system, which includes the tetrahedral network of magnetic<lb/> ions. A large number of compounds are classified in the family of pyrochlore oxides, and<lb/> these compounds exhibit a wide variety of physical properties ranging from insulator<lb/> through semiconductor and from bad metal to good metal. Until now, however,<lb/> no superconductivity has been reported for frustrated pyrochlore oxides. The bulk<lb/> superconductivity of this compound is confirmed by measurements of the resistivity and<lb/> the a. c. magnetic susceptibility. The H c2 , which is extrapolated to 0 K, is estimated as<lb/> about 0.8 T, using the resistivity measurements under aplied field. The plot of H c2 vs T<lb/> indicates that the Cooper pairs are composed of rather heavy quasiparticles. This fact<lb/> suggests that frustrated heavy electrons become superconducting in this compound.<lb/></div>
