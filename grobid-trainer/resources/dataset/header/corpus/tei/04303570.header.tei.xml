	<div type="abstract">Abstract—Multisensor data fusion based on wireless sensor<lb/> networks (WSN) has many advantages over the traditional data<lb/> fusion and is faced with many challenges. Because sensor nodes<lb/> in WSN decentralize over wide area and data must be transmit-<lb/> ted to the central processor by use of special wireless transport<lb/> protocols for fusion, data delay and missing continually occur<lb/> across sensor networks. Therefore, sensor measurements arrive<lb/> in the central processor out-of-sequence, accordingly, optimal<lb/> fusion problem for "Out-of-sequence" measurements (OOSM)<lb/> is presented. For OOSM fusion problem, two main methods<lb/> are presented such as giving up directly and reused delayed<lb/> information. Some problems will be produced such as lower<lb/> fusion accuracy and bad convergence and stability for the<lb/> former. For the idea of reusing delayed information, some<lb/> effective fusion methods have been reported, whereas many<lb/> limitations still exist in them, for example confined application,<lb/> huge computation and bad implementation and so forth. In<lb/> order to overcome above problems, a novel decentralized fusion<lb/> estimator based on relative measurements, which is to reuse<lb/> the delayed OOSM, is proposed in this paper. Through making<lb/> use of basic systemic state equation, the relative measurements<lb/> of current state corresponding to delayed measurements can<lb/> be obtained and fusion can be performed by use of federal<lb/> fusion. In addition, some other forms of the decentralized fusion<lb/> estimator are all given and discussed for different situations. The<lb/> algorithm analysis shows that the decentralized fusion estimator<lb/> is suboptimal and its fusion accuracy is lower than that of<lb/> current batch or centralized fusion, but it has better practicality<lb/> and lower computation. Finally, simulation experiment proves<lb/> the validity of the proposed decentralized fusion estimator.<lb/> </div>
