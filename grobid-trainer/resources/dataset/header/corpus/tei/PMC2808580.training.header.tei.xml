	<titlePart>The Relation Between Hypoalbuminemia and Compliance and<lb/> Intima-media Thickness of Carotid Artery in Continuous Ambulatory<lb/> Peritoneal Dialysis Patients<lb/></titlePart>
	</docTitle>

	<div type="abstract">The aim of this study was to identify the main factor affecting compliance and intima-<lb/>media thickness of the elastic common carotid artery in continuous ambulatory peri-<lb/>toneal dialysis patients. Increased intima-media thickness and decreased arterial<lb/> compliance are associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. This study<lb/> included 20 patients and 20 age-and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The<lb/> compliance and intima-media thickness of the right common carotid artery within 1 cm<lb/> to the bifurcation were measured three times using high-resolution B-mode echocar-<lb/>diography. Blood samples were obtained to measure levels of hemoglobin, phospho-<lb/>rus, total calcium, total CO2, serum albumin, C-reactive protein, serum total choles-<lb/>terol, LDL-and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. We found that the compliance of<lb/> common carotid artery was lower in the patient group than in the control group. In<lb/> the patient group, the compliance of common carotid artery was positively correlated<lb/> with serum albumin concentration, and intima-media thickness of common carotid<lb/> artery was negatively correlated with serum albumin levels. Stepwise regression<lb/> analysis showed that serum albumin concentration was independently related to<lb/> the compliance of common carotid artery, suggesting hypoalbuminemia can inde-<lb/>pendently give deleterious effects on the arterial wall in continuous ambulatory peri-<lb/>toneal dialysis patients.<lb/></div>
