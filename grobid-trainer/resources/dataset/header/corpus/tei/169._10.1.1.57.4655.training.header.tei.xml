	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">This report presents results of a peer review of MQPs conducted within<lb/> the Computer Science Department during the Summer of 1995 as part of a<lb/> campus-wide MQP review. The goal of the report is to assess whether the<lb/> department MQPs are accomplishing their educational goals. The report<lb/> identi es problems that need to be addressed and trends that need to be<lb/> continued to make the MQPs a worthwhile learning experience. It re ects<lb/> data and evaluations for 27 MQPs, involving 43 computer science students,<lb/> that were completed between the Summer of 1994 and the Spring of 1995.<lb/> The report also makes comparisons to similar reviews done in 1991 and 1993.<lb/> Overall, the large majority of the projects are meeting the educational<lb/> goals of the department as good learning experiences. The reviews indicate<lb/> the overall quality of the projects is good, about the same as in 1993 and<lb/> a little better than 1991. The report draws a number of conclusions about<lb/> the success of the projects based upon the data collected and evaluations<lb/> done for this review. The report concludes with recommendations for future<lb/> projects.</div>
