	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">A prominent ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing compound of unknown identity was discovered in<lb/> the aqueous humor of birds, believed to be a key UV-filter of the eyes of aves. The<lb/> compound´s concentration correlates with species´ natural flight altitudes, with the highest<lb/> concentrations found in goose chamber fluid (up to 10,000 m flight altitude). We present<lb/> evidence that the compound is 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), based on analysis using liquid<lb/> chromatography, UV spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic<lb/> resonance spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. DHI is a precursor<lb/> of melanin (the key UV-absorbing polymer in biology), produced in the proximity of the<lb/> chamber fluid. Identification was greatly challenged by the compound´s tendency to<lb/> polymerize when enriched. DHI may function not only as nature´s UV-filter in the skin, but<lb/> also as &quot;sunglasses&quot; as well.<lb/></div>

	Significance Statement<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Nature provides species with various solutions for protecting the eyes from sun radiation.<lb/> For example, the eye contains compounds that absorb UV radiation, like ascorbic acid. But<lb/> what about the more extreme cases like geese, which fly as high as 10,000 meters (above<lb/> the Himalayas)? In the aqueous humor of birds, an unknown compound provides a major<lb/> contribution for UV-absorbance. The higher the bird can fly, the more of this compound is<lb/> present, suggesting its significance to Nature. We have identified this compound as being<lb/> 5,6-dehydroxyindole. This compound is also a building block of melanin, a skin protector.<lb/> Hence, using various analytical/spectroscopic techniques, we have unraveled &quot;sunglasses&quot;<lb/> that evolution has provided aves. It is conceivable that this compound could be used for<lb/> humans as well, e.g. as a component in both contact lenses and intraocular lenses.</div>
