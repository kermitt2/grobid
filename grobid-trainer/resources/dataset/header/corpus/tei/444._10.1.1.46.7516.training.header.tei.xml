	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">It is obvious to anyone familiar with the rules of the game of chess<lb/> that a king on an empty board can reach every square. It is true, but<lb/> not obvious, that a knight can reach every square. Why is the rst<lb/> fact obvious but the second fact not? This paper presents an analytic<lb/> theory of a class of obviousness judgments of this type. Whether or<lb/> not the speci cs of this analysis are correct, it seems that the study of<lb/> obviousness judgments can be used to construct integrated theories of<lb/> linguistics, knowledge representation, and inference.<lb/></div>
