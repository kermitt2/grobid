		<div type="abstract">We have studied extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in spacetimes containing a rotating black hole <lb/> and a non-self-gravitating torus with a constant distribution of specific angular momentum. We have found <lb/> that the dissipative effect of the hydrodynamic drag exerted by the torus on the satellite is much smaller <lb/> than the corresponding one due to radiation reaction, for systems such as those generically expected in <lb/> active galactic nuclei and at distances from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) which can be <lb/> probed with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, given the uncertainty on the <lb/> parameters of these systems, namely, on the masses of the SMBH and of the torus, as well as on its size, <lb/> there exist configurations in which the effect of the hydrodynamic drag on the orbital evolution can be <lb/> comparable to the radiation reaction one in phases of the inspiral which are detectable by the Laser <lb/> Interferometer Space Antenna. This is the case, for instance, for a 10  6  M  SMBH surrounded by a <lb/> corotating torus of comparable mass and with radius of 10 3  ?10  4  gravitational radii, or for a 10 5 M  SMBH <lb/> surrounded by a corotating 10 4 M  torus with radius of 10 5  gravitational radii. Should these conditions be <lb/> met in astrophysical systems, EMRI-gravitational waves could provide a characteristic signature of the <lb/> presence of the torus. In fact, while radiation reaction always increases the inclination of the orbit with <lb/> respect to the equatorial plane (i.e., orbits evolve towards the equatorial retrograde configuration), the <lb/> hydrodynamic drag from a torus corotating with the SMBH always decreases it (i.e., orbits evolve towards <lb/> the equatorial prograde configuration). However, even when initially dominating over radiation reaction, <lb/> the influence of the hydrodynamic drag decays very rapidly as the satellite moves into the very strong-field <lb/> region of the SMBH (i.e., p &amp; 5M), thus allowing one to use pure-Kerr templates for the last part of the <lb/> inspiral. Although our results have been obtained for a specific class of tori, we argue that they will be <lb/> qualitatively valid also for more generic distributions of the specific angular momentum. <lb/></div>
