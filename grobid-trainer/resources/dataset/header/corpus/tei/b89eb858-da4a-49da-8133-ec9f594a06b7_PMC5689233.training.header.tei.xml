	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: There is a recognized need to include patients in setting research priori-<lb/>ties. Research priorities identified by people with a stoma are rarely elicited.<lb/> Objectives: To improve the quality of life of people with a stoma through use of<lb/> evidence-based practice based on research priorities set by patients.<lb/> Design and Methods: Online pilot survey publicized in 2016 via United Kingdom stoma char-<lb/>ities. People ranked nine stoma-related quality of life topics in order of research priority.<lb/> Participants: People 16 years of age and over who currently have or have had a stoma<lb/> for treatment for any medical condition.<lb/> Analysis: Distributions of the priority scores for each of the nine research topics were<lb/> examined. Group differences were explored using either the Mann-Whitney U-test or<lb/> the Kruskal-Wallis test depending on the number of groups.<lb/> Results: In total, 225 people completed the survey. The most important research priority was<lb/> pouch leak problems and stoma bag/appliance problems followed by hernia risk. There were<lb/> statistically significant differences in ranking research priorities between males and females,<lb/> age, underlying disease that led to a stoma, stoma type and length of time with a stoma.<lb/> Conclusion: People with a stoma are willing to engage in and set research priorities.<lb/> The results should contribute towards future research about setting the research<lb/> agenda for the study of stoma-related concerns that impact quality of life.<lb/></div>
