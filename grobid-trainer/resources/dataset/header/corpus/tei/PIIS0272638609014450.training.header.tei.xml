	<div type="abstract">Background: Clinical and pathologic features that predict outcome have important potential applica-<lb/>tion in patients with pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis (usually antineutrophil cytoplasmic<lb/> antibody-associated vasculitis). This study examines the predictive value of simple quantitative renal<lb/> histologic measurements in a large cohort with extended follow-up.<lb/> Study Design: Cohort study.<lb/> Setting &amp; Participants: 390 consecutive patients with pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis<lb/> at a single hospital (1983-2002); 90 patients underwent repeated kidney biopsy during follow-up.<lb/> Predictors: Age and serum creatinine concentration at biopsy, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody specificity,<lb/> percentage of normal glomeruli, percentage of glomeruli with active lesions, and index of chronic damage<lb/> (quantitative measurement of established cortical damage) in the initial kidney biopsy for all patients. The same<lb/> factors were assessed in both biopsy specimens for patients undergoing an additional biopsy.<lb/> Outcomes &amp; Measurements: End-stage renal disease and patient survival.<lb/> Results: Mortality at 1 and 5 years was 23% and 40%, respectively: standardized mortality ratio, 4.74<lb/> (95% CI, 3.62-6.32). End-stage renal disease was reached by 14% and 18% at 1 and 5 years,<lb/> respectively. In multivariable analysis, serum creatinine level at biopsy and percentage of normal<lb/> glomeruli in the initial biopsy specimen were the best predictors of kidney survival. C Statistics were 0.80<lb/> for creatinine level alone and 0.83 for creatinine level with normal glomeruli. In patients undergoing an<lb/> additional biopsy, rapid progression in the index of chronic damage and serum creatinine level at the<lb/> second biopsy were associated with kidney survival in multivariable analysis.<lb/> Limitations: Retrospective analysis. External validity of the index of chronic damage requires further<lb/> assessment. Selection bias may influence repeated biopsy analyses.<lb/> Conclusions: Serum creatinine level at biopsy best predicts kidney survival in patients with<lb/> pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis overall.<lb/></div>
