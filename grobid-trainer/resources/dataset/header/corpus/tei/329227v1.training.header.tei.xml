	Abstract (193 words)<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">MicroRNAs are potent post-transcriptional regulators involved in all hallmarks of cancer.<lb/> Mir-196a is transcribed from two loci and has been implicated in a wide range of<lb/> developmental and pathogenic processes, with targets including Hox, Fox, Cdk inhibitors and<lb/> annexins. Genetic variants and altered expression of miR196a are associated with risk and<lb/> progression of multiple cancers including breast cancer, however little is known about the<lb/> regulation of the genes encoding this miRNA, nor the impact of variants therein. Here we<lb/> demonstrate that MIR196A displays complex and dynamic expression patterns, in part<lb/> controlled by long range transcriptional regulation between promoter and enhancer elements<lb/> bound by ERα. Expression of this miRNA is significantly increased in models of hormone<lb/> receptor positive disease resistance. The expression of MIR196A also proves to be a robust<lb/> prognostic factor for patients with advanced and post-menopausal ER+ disease. This work<lb/> sheds light on the normal and abnormal regulation of MIR196A and provides a novel<lb/> stratification method for therapeutically resistant breast cancer.<lb/></div>
