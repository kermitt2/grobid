	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Introduction: Mercury intoxication may present in a wide range of clinical forms from a simple disease to fatal<lb/> poisoning. This article presents a case of acute mercury poisoning, a rare condition that presents challenges for<lb/> diagnosis with fever of unknown origin.<lb/> Case presentation: A 52-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to the hospital with high fever, sore throat, a<lb/> rash over her entire body, itching, nausea, and extensive muscle pain. She had cervical, bilateral axillary and mediastinal<lb/> lymphadenopathies. We learned that her son and husband had similar symptoms. After excluding infectious pathologies,<lb/> autoimmune diseases and malignancy were investigated. Multiple organs of our patient were involved and her fever<lb/> persisted at the fourth week of admission. A repeat medical history elicited that her son had brought mercury home<lb/> from school and put it on the hot stove, and the family had been exposed to the fumes for a long period of time.<lb/> Our patient&apos;s serum and urine mercury levels were high. She was diagnosed with mercury poisoning and treated<lb/> accordingly.<lb/> Conclusions: Mercury vapor is a colourless and odorless substance. Therefore, patients with various unexplained<lb/> symptoms and clinical conditions should be questioned about possible exposure to mercury.<lb/></div>
