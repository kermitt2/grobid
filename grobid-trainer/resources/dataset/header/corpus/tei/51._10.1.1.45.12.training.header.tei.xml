	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The role of the systems analyst in the implementation process has changed<lb/> dramatically in recent times because of changes to organisational boundaries, the<lb/> need to align IT with business objectives and the complexity of the systems now<lb/> required. Some organisations are finding themselves in a continually changing<lb/> environment and being involved in multi-organisational structures. Establishing<lb/> strategies and requirements for these organisations requires a new understanding<lb/> of the implementation process. Implementation is concerned with behavioural<lb/> phenomena since people are involved from the inception of the idea, as well as<lb/> being involved in the development process. They are also affected by the changes<lb/> which the new system brings to the organisation. The research is attempting to<lb/> understand the critical factors associated with the implementation process and<lb/> consequently develop an appropriate model.</div>
