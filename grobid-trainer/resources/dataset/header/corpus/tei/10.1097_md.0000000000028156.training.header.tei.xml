	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Helicobacter pylori infection and hyperglycemia are associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasm, and<lb/> may have a synergistic effect in combination. However, these 2 factors that affect colorectal neoplasm remain controversial. We<lb/> aimed to carry out a meta-analysis to evaluate the study population diabetes prevalence rate and H pylori infection rate with colorectal<lb/> adenoma risk for adults.<lb/> Methods: We conducted systemic research through English databases for medical reports. We also recorded the diabetes<lb/> prevalence and H pylori infection prevalence in each study. We classified these studies into 4 subgroups as their background<lb/> population diabetes prevalence &lt;6% (Group 1); between 6% and 8% (Group 2); between 8% and 10% (Group 3), and more than<lb/> 10% (Group 4). The random-effects model had used to calculate pooled prevalence estimates with 95% confidence interval (CI).<lb/> Results: Twenty-seven studies were finally eligible for meta-analysis. The random-effects model of the meta-analysis was chosen,<lb/> showing pooled odds ratio (OR) equal to 1.51 (95% CI 1.39-1.63). The subgroup meta-analyses showed in Group 1 the H pylori<lb/> infection associated colorectal adenoma risk OR was 1.24 (95% CI 0.86-1.78). As the diabetes rate exceed 6%, the H pylori infection<lb/> became the more significant increased risk of colorectal adenoma (Group 2: OR 2.16 (95% CI 1.61-2.91); Group 3: OR 1.40 (95% CI<lb/> 1.24-1.57); and Group 4: OR 1.52 (95% CI 1.46-1.57)).<lb/> Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis showed elevated diabetes prevalence combined H pylori infection increasing the<lb/> risks of colorectal adenoma in the adult population.<lb/></div>
