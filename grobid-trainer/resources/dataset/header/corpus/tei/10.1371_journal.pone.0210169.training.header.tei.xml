	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Older adults suffering from hypertension form firm medication beliefs through lifetime medi-<lb/>cation management, which significantly affect their medication adherence and treatment<lb/> outcomes. Understanding whether the patient-physician communication has the potential to<lb/> change medication beliefs will help design an effective communication strategy to foster<lb/> favorable medication beliefs. This study aims to determine whether the patient-physician<lb/> communication is associated with medication beliefs among older adults with hypertension<lb/> and controls socio-demographics and clinical characteristics. Further, it examines how the<lb/> association varies with two different types of medication beliefs (medication overuse and<lb/> harm) for each domain of communication (informative and interpersonal). A self-adminis-<lb/>tered cross-sectional survey was conducted for members of seven senior centers in a met-<lb/>ropolitan area of the United States between August and December of 2013. A total of 211<lb/> senior members suffering from hypertension completed the questionnaire, which included<lb/> the Primary Care Assessment Survey (PCAS) and the Beliefs about Medicines Question-<lb/>naire (BMQ). The former had two domains of patient-physician communication-informative<lb/> and interpersonal-while the latter measured medication harm and overuse beliefs. Inter-<lb/>personal patient-physician communication significantly explained the medication overuse<lb/> beliefs (β = -0.28, p &lt; 0.05), whereas neither interpersonal nor informative communication<lb/> significantly explained the medication harm beliefs. Females (β = 1.29, p &lt; 0.01) and partici-<lb/>pants with higher education (β = 2.66, p = 0.02) more strongly believed that medications are<lb/> overprescribed. However, participants with low income more strongly believed that medica-<lb/>tions are harmful. Patient-physician communication, if it touches upon interpersonal<lb/> aspects, has the potential to change medication overuse beliefs among older adults with<lb/> hypertension. Identification of the significant factors which affect medication beliefs, will<lb/> inform the design of a patient-centric communication program that fosters favorable medica-<lb/>tion beliefs among geriatric hypertensive patients.<lb/></div>
