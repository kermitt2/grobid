	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Education may encourage personal and collective responses to climate change, but climate<lb/> education has proven surprisingly difficult and complex. Self-perception of knowledge and<lb/> intelligence represent one factor that may impact willingness to learn about climate change.<lb/> We explored this possibility with a case study in Raleigh, North Carolina in 2015 (n = 200).<lb/> Our goal was to test how gender and ethnicity influenced perceptions people had of their<lb/> own climate change knowledge. Survey respondents were asked how strongly they agreed<lb/> with the statement &quot;I feel knowledgeable about climate change&quot; (1 = strongly disagree, and<lb/> 5 = strongly agree). Our survey instrument also included demographic questions about<lb/> race, age, income, gender, and education, as well as respondent&apos;s experience with natural<lb/> disasters and drought. We observed an interaction between education and gender where<lb/> women&apos;s self-perceived knowledge was higher than men among people with low levels of<lb/> educational attainment, but was higher for men than women among people with high levels<lb/> of educational attainment. In addition, minority respondents self-reported lower perceived<lb/> climate change knowledge than white respondents, regardless of educational attainment.<lb/> This study enhances our understanding of the gender gap in self-perceptions of climate<lb/> knowledge by suggesting it is contingent on educational attainment. This could be the result<lb/> of stereotype-threat experienced by women and minorities, and exacerbated by educational<lb/> systems. Because people who question their knowledge are often more able to learn, partic-<lb/>ularly in ideologically charged contexts, highly educated women and minorities may be<lb/> more successful learning about climate change than white men.<lb/></div>
