	<div type="abstract">The infinite-layer compound ACuO2 (A = alkaline-earth ions) is regarded as the most suitable<lb/> material for exploring the fundamental nature of the CuO2 plane because it does not contain a<lb/> charge-reservoir block, such as a rock-salt or a fluorite like block. We report that superconductivity<lb/> in the infinite-layer compound Sr0.9La0.1CuO2 is of a three-dimensional nature, in contrast to the<lb/> quasi two-dimensional superconducting behavior of all other cuprates. The key observation is that<lb/> the c-axis coherence length is longer than the c-axis lattice constant even at zero temperature.<lb/> This means that the superconducting order parameter of one CuO2 plane overlaps with those of<lb/> neighboring CuO2 planes all the temperatures below the Tc. Among all cuprates, only the infinite-<lb/>layer superconductor shows such a feature.</div>
