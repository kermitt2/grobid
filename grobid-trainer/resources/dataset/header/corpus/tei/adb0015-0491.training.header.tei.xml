	ABSTRACT<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Abnormal cue reactivity is a central characteristic of addiction, associated with increased activity in motivation,<lb/> attention and memory related brain circuits. In this neuroimaging study, cue reactivity in problem gamblers (PRG) was<lb/> compared with cue reactivity in heavy smokers (HSM) and healthy controls (HC). A functional magnetic resonance<lb/> imaging event-related cue reactivity paradigm, consisting of gambling, smoking-related and neutral pictures, was<lb/> employed in 17 treatment-seeking non-smoking PRG, 18 non-gambling HSM, and 17 non-gambling and non-smoking<lb/> HC. Watching gambling pictures (relative to neutral pictures) was associated with higher brain activation in occipito-<lb/>temporal areas, posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala in PRG compared with HC and HSM.<lb/> Subjective craving in PRG correlated positively with brain activation in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and left<lb/> insula. When comparing the HSM group with the two other groups, no significant differences in brain activity induced<lb/> by smoking cues were found. In a stratified analysis, the HSM subgroup with higher Fagerström Test for Nicotine<lb/> Dependence scores (FTND M = 5.4) showed higher brain activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior<lb/> cingulate cortex, insula and middle/superior temporal gyrus while watching smoking-related pictures (relative to<lb/> neutral pictures) than the HSM subgroup with lower FTND scores (FTND M = 2.9) and than non-smoking HC. Nicotine<lb/> craving correlated with activation in left prefrontal and left amygdala when viewing smoking-related pictures in HSM.<lb/> Increased regional responsiveness to gambling pictures in brain regions linked to motivation and visual processing is<lb/> present in PRG, similar to neural mechanisms underlying cue reactivity in substance dependence. Increased brain<lb/> activation in related fronto-limbic brain areas was present in HSM with higher FTND scores compared with HSM with<lb/> lower FTND scores.<lb/></div>
