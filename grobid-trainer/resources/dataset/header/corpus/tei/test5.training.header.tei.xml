	<div type="abstract">We studied androgen receptor (AR) gene expression in primary breast cancer (BC) to determine associations with clinical<lb/> characteristics and outcomes in the I-SPY 1 study. AR was evaluated in I-SPY 1 (n = 149) using expression microarrays.<lb/> Associations of AR with clinical and tumor features were determined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (two-level factors) or the<lb/> Kruskal-Wallis test (multi-level factors). We identified an optimal AR cut-point to maximize recurrence-free survival (RFS)<lb/> differences between AR biomarker stratified groups, and assessed the association between the AR stratified groups and RFS<lb/> using the Cox proportional hazard model. Pearson correlations between AR and selected genes were determined in I-SPY 1,<lb/> METABRIC (n = 1992), and TCGA (n = 817). AR was lower in triple negative BC vs. hormone receptor positive (HR+)/HER2− and<lb/> HER2+ disease (p &lt; 0.00001), and lower in basal-like BC (p &lt; 0.00001). AR was higher in grade I/II vs. III tumors (p &lt; 0.00001), in<lb/> patients &gt;age 50 (p = 0.05), and in node negative disease (p = 0.006). Higher AR was associated with better RFS (p = 0.0007),<lb/> which remained significant after receptor subtype adjustment (p = 0.01). AR correlated with expression of luminal, HER2, and<lb/> steroid hormone genes. AR expression was related to clinicopathologic features, intrinsic subtype, and correlated with<lb/> improved outcome.<lb/></div>
