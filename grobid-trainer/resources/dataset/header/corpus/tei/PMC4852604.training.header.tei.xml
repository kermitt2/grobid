	<div type="abstract">Objective: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is relatively common in neurosurgical field. However not all patients de-<lb/>velop CSDH after minor head trauma. In this study, we evaluate the risk factors of post-traumatic CSDH.<lb/> Methods: Two-hundred and seventy-seven patients were enrolled and analyzed in this study from January 2012 to Decem-<lb/>ber 2013. Of those, 20 participants had minor head trauma developed CSDH afterward. We also included 257 patients with<lb/> minor head trauma who did not develop CSDH during the same follow-up period as the control group. We investigated the<lb/> risk factors related to the development of CSDH after minor head trauma.<lb/> Results: Old age (p=0.014), preexisting diabetes mellitus (p=0.010), hypertension (p=0.026), history of cerebral infarction<lb/> (p=0.035), antiplatelet agents (p=0.000), acute subdural hematoma in the convexity (p=0.000), encephalomalacia (p=<lb/> 0.029), and long distance between skull and brain parenchyma (p=0.000) were significantly correlated with the develop-<lb/>ment of CSDH after trauma. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the maximum distance between the skull and the cere-<lb/>bral parenchyma was the independent risk factor for the occurrence of CSDH (hazard ratio 2.55, p=0.000).<lb/> Conclusion: We should consider the possibility of developing CSDH in the post-traumatic patients with the identified risk<lb/> factors.<lb/></div>
