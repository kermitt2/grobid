	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">The interaction between philopatry and nonrandom mating has important<lb/> consequences for the genetic structure of populations, influencing co-ances-<lb/>try within social groups but also inbreeding. Here, using genetic paternity<lb/> data, we describe mating patterns in a wild population of red deer (Cervus<lb/> elaphus) which are associated with marked consequences for co-ancestry<lb/> and inbreeding in the population. Around a fifth of females mate with a<lb/> male with whom they have mated previously, and further, females<lb/> frequently mate with a male with whom a female relative has also mated<lb/> (intralineage polygyny). Both of these phenomena occur more than<lb/> expected under random mating. Using simulations, we demonstrate that<lb/> temporal and spatial factors, as well as skew in male breeding success, are<lb/> important in promoting both re-mating behaviours and intralineage poly-<lb/>gyny. However, the information modelled was not sufficient to explain the<lb/> extent to which these behaviours occurred. We show that re-mating and<lb/> intralineage polygyny are associated with increased pairwise relatedness in<lb/> the population and a rise in average inbreeding coefficients. In particular,<lb/> the latter resulted from a correlation between male relatedness and rutting<lb/> location, with related males being more likely to rut in proximity to one<lb/> another. These patterns, alongside their consequences for the genetic struc-<lb/>ture of the population, have rarely been documented in wild polygynous<lb/> mammals, yet they have important implications for our understanding of<lb/> genetic structure, inbreeding avoidance and dispersal in such systems.<lb/></div>
