	<div type="abstract">BACKGROUND<lb/> Cervical flexion myelopathy is quite a rare condition af-<lb/>fecting mainly adolescent males who present with mus-<lb/>cular atrophy of the upper extremities. Its etiology is still<lb/> unknown, as is the cause of its marked male preponder-<lb/>ance. Disproportion of the cervical spine and spinal cord<lb/> is suspected to be one of the etiological causes, however,<lb/> this has yet to be confirmed. METHODS<lb/> We performed a comparative study of the cervical mag-<lb/>netic resonance (MR) images of six male patients with<lb/> juvenile cervical flexion myelopathy and of 34 young,<lb/> normal controls. RESULTS<lb/> In normal controls, the cervical spines and spinal cords<lb/> were significantly straighter in tall than in short males<lb/> and in females than in males. In these patients, the cer-<lb/>vical spine and spinal cord shapes were straighter, and<lb/> the cervical spine length/height and cervical spinal cord<lb/> length/height ratios were significantly higher than those<lb/> of the height-matched male group. In the female group,<lb/> the cervical spine and cervical spinal cord shapes were<lb/> similar to the patient group; however, the cervical spine<lb/> length/height and spinal cord length/height ratios as well<lb/> as the heights were significantly smaller than those of the<lb/> patients. CONCLUSIONS<lb/> The cervical spinal cords of the patients were considered<lb/> to be stretched even with the neck in neutral position,<lb/> reflecting disproportion of the cervical spine and spinal<lb/> cord. The shorter length of the cervical spine and spinal<lb/> cord in females was suspected to be one of the reasons<lb/> for the marked male preponderance.</div>
