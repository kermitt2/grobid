	<div type="abstract">The behavioral and emotional problems children develop<lb/> may differ from one cultural context to another. We explored this possibility, comparing 11-15-<lb/>year-old Embu children in Kenya, Thai children, African-American children, and Caucasian-<lb/>American children. Standardized parent reports on 118 problems revealed 62 significant (p &lt;<lb/> .01) culture effects. Caucasian-Americans were rated particularly high on undercontrolled prob-<lb/>lems (e.g., arguing, disobedient at home, cruel to others). Embu children were rated particularly<lb/> high on overcontrolled problems (e.g., fears, feels guilty, somatic concerns), largely because of<lb/> the numerous somatic problems reported. The findings may relate to the strict emphasis on<lb/> compliance and obedience among the Embu, as opposed to the greater independence permitted<lb/> in the United States. But alternative interpretations are discussed as well, including the effects<lb/> of parent sensitivities and Third World living conditions.<lb/></div>
