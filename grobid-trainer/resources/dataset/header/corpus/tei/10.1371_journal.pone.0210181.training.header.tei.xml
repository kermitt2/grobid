	Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Background<lb/> While life-long impacts exist for infants born one or two weeks early little evidence exists for<lb/> those infants born after their due date. However interventions could be used to expedite<lb/> birth if the risks of continuing the pregnancy are higher than intervening. It is known that the<lb/> risk of epilepsy in childhood is higher in infants exposed to perinatal compromise and there-<lb/>fore may be useful as a proxy for intrapartum compromise. The aim of this work is to quantify<lb/> the likelihood of children developing epilepsy based on their gestational age at birth (37-39<lb/> weeks or �41 weeks). Methods<lb/> The work is based on term infants born in Sweden between 1983 and 1993 (n = 1,030,168),<lb/> linked to data on disability pension, child mortality and in-patient epilepsy care. The refer-<lb/>ence group was defined as infants born at 39 or 40 completed weeks of gestation; compared<lb/> with infants born at early term (37/38 weeks) or late/post term (41 weeks or more). Primary<lb/> outcome was defined a-priori as a diagnosis of epilepsy before 20 years of age. Secondary<lb/> outcomes were childhood mortality (before five years of age), and registered for disability<lb/> pension before 20 years of age. Logistic regression models were used to assess any associ-<lb/>ation of the outcomes with gestational age at birth. Findings<lb/> In the unadjusted results, infants born 7 or more days after their due date had higher risks of<lb/> epilepsy and disability pension than the reference group, but similar risks of child death.<lb/> Early term infants showed higher risks of epilepsy, disability pension and child death. After<lb/> adjustment for confounders, there remained a higher risk of epilepsy for both early term (OR<lb/> 1�19 (1�11-1�29)) and late/post term infants (OR 1�13 (1�06-1�22)).<lb/></div>
