	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: In humans, myocardial infarction is characterized by irreversible loss of heart tissue, which becomes<lb/> replaced with a fibrous scar. By contrast, teleost fish and urodele amphibians are capable of heart regeneration<lb/> after a partial amputation. However, due to the lack of a suitable infarct model, it is not known how these animals<lb/> respond to myocardial infarction.<lb/> Results: Here, we have established a heart infarct model in zebrafish using cryoinjury. In contrast to the common<lb/> method of partial resection, cryoinjury results in massive cell death within 20% of the ventricular wall, similar to<lb/> that observed in mammalian infarcts. As in mammals, the initial stages of the injury response include thrombosis,<lb/> accumulation of fibroblasts and collagen deposition. However, at later stages, cardiac cells can enter the cell cycle<lb/> and invade the infarct area in zebrafish. In the subsequent two months, fibrotic scar tissue is progressively<lb/> eliminated by cell apoptosis and becomes replaced with a new myocardium, resulting in scarless regeneration. We<lb/> show that tissue remodeling at the myocardial-infarct border zone is associated with accumulation of Vimentin-<lb/>positive fibroblasts and with expression of an extracellular matrix protein Tenascin-C. Electrocardiogram analysis<lb/> demonstrated that the reconstitution of the cardiac muscle leads to the restoration of the heart function.<lb/> Conclusions: We developed a new cryoinjury model to induce myocardial infarction in zebrafish. Although the<lb/> initial stages following cryoinjury resemble typical healing in mammals, the zebrafish heart is capable of structural<lb/> and functional regeneration. Understanding the key healing processes after myocardial infarction in zebrafish may<lb/> result in identification of the barriers to efficient cardiac regeneration in mammals.<lb/></div>
