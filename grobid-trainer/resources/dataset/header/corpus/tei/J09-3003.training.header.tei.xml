	<div type="abstract">Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large lexicon of words marked<lb/> with their prior polarity (also called semantic orientation). However, the contextual polarity of<lb/> the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the<lb/> word&apos;s prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or<lb/> vice versa. Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in<lb/> context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of this work is to<lb/> automatically distinguish between prior and contextual polarity, with a focus on understanding<lb/> which features are important for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is<lb/> identifying when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for distinguishing<lb/> between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between<lb/> positive and negative contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance<lb/> of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all learning algorithms except<lb/> one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance. Another facet of the<lb/> evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of features for<lb/> distinguishing between positive and negative polarity. These experiments show that the presence<lb/> of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the<lb/> best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system&apos;s ability to<lb/> identify when an instance is neutral.<lb/></div>
