	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Objective. We previously described abnormalities in the bone marrow of patients with<lb/> rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but were able to shed little light on the pathogenic roles of<lb/> in¯ammatory cytokines and proteinases in joint destruction in the subchondral region in RA.<lb/> This is the ®rst report to describe the co-localization of cytokines and proteinases in this area.<lb/> Methods. Decalci®ed paraf®n-embedded sections from 10 patients with RA and ®ve patients<lb/> with osteoarthritis (OA) were examined for the immunolocalization of cathepsins B, K and L<lb/> and the localization of messenger RNAs for interleukin 1b (IL-1b), tumour necrosis factor<lb/> a (TNF-a) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). The cells were double-stained with<lb/> anti-CD68 or anti-prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PH) antibody.<lb/> Results. An immunohistochemical study con®rmed the expression of cathepsins B and L by<lb/> CD68-positive mononuclear cells at the sites of signi®cant cartilage and bone erosion from the<lb/> subchondral region in all RA specimens. Osteoclast-like cells showed intense staining for<lb/> cathepsin K and MMP-9. Osteoblast-like cells strongly expressed MMP-9. Analysis of serial<lb/> sections revealed that expression of the IL-1b and TNF-a genes occurred near that of the<lb/> cathepsins and MMP-9 in the subchondral region.<lb/> Conclusion. We conclude that in¯ammatory cytokines and tissue-damaging proteinases play<lb/> important roles in joint destruction in the subchondral region in RA.<lb/></div>
