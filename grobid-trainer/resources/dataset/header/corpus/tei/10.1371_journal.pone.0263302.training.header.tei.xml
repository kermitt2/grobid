	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Organic matter management is key to sustain ecosystem services provided by soils. How-<lb/>ever, it is rarely considered in a holistic view, considering local resources, agro-environmen-<lb/>tal effects and harmonization with farmers&apos; needs. Organic inputs, like compost and biochar,<lb/> could represent a sustainable solution to massive current challenges associated to the inten-<lb/>sification of agriculture, in particular for tropical regions. Here we assess the potential of agri-<lb/>cultural residues as a resource for farmer communities in southwestern India to reduce their<lb/> dependency on external inputs and sustain ecosystem services. We propose a novel joint<lb/> evaluation of farmers&apos; aspirations together with agro-environmental effects of organic inputs<lb/> on soils. Our soil quality evaluation showed that biochar alone or with compost did not<lb/> improve unilaterally soils in the tropics (Anthroposol, Ferralsol and Vertisol). Many organic<lb/> inputs led to an initial decrease in water-holding capacities of control soils (-27.3%: coconut<lb/> shell biochar with compost on Anthroposol). Responses to organic matter inputs for carbon<lb/> were strongest for Ferralsols (+33.4% with rice husk biochar), and mostly positive for Anthro-<lb/>posols and Vertisols (+12.5% to +13.8% respectively). Soil pH responses were surprisingly<lb/> negative for Ferralsols and only positive if biochar was applied alone (between -5.6% to<lb/> +1.9%). For Anthroposols and Vertisols, highest increases were achieved with rice husk bio-<lb/>char + vermicomposts (+7.2% and +5.2% respectively). Our socio-economic evaluation<lb/> showed that farmers with a stronger economical position showed greater interest towards<lb/> technology like biochar (factor 1.3 to 1.6 higher for farmers cultivating Anthroposols and/or<lb/> Vertisols compared to Ferralsols), while poorer farmers more skepticism, which may lead to<lb/> an increased economical gap within rural communities if technologies are not implemented<lb/> with long-term guidance. These results advocate for an interdisciplinary evaluation of agricul-<lb/>tural technology prior to its implementation as a development tool in the field.<lb/></div>
