	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Ribonuclease III (RNase III) activity modulates hundreds of genes in Escherichia coli (E. coli). YmdB, a<lb/> member of the macrodomain protein family, is one of known trans-acting regulators of RNase III activity; however,<lb/> the significance of its regulatory role in specific bacterial cellular processes and related genes has not been determined.<lb/> YmdB overexpression was used to model YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in vivo, and microarray analysis identified<lb/> gene targets and cellular processes related to RNase III inhibition.<lb/> Results: The expression of &gt;2,000 E. coli genes was modulated by YmdB induction; 129 genes were strongly regulated,<lb/> of which 80 have not been reported as RNase III targets. Of these, ten are involved in biofilm formation. Significantly,<lb/> YmdB overexpression also inhibited biofilm formation via a process that is not uniquely dependent upon RNase III<lb/> inhibition. Moreover, biofilm formation is interdependently regulated by RpoS, a known stress response regulator and<lb/> biofilm inhibitor, and by YmdB.<lb/> Conclusions: This is the first global profile of target genes modulated by YmdB-induced RNase III inhibition in<lb/> E. coli, and the data reveal a novel, hitherto unrecognized regulatory role for YmdB in biofilm modulation.<lb/></div>
