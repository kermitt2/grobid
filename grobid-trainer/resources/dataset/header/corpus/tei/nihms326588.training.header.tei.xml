	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">In this paper, we use publicly available data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey -<lb/>Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) to investigate the effect of Massachusetts&apos; health reform plan on<lb/> employer-sponsored insurance premiums. We tabulate premium growth for private-sector<lb/> employers in Massachusetts and the United States as a whole for 2004 -2008. We estimate the<lb/> effect of the plan as the difference in premium growth between Massachusetts and the United<lb/> States between 2006 and 2008-that is, before versus after the plan-over and above the<lb/> difference in premium growth for 2004 to 2006. We find that health reform in Massachusetts<lb/> increased single-coverage employer-sponsored insurance premiums by about 6 percent, or $262.<lb/> Although our research design has important limitations, it does suggest that policy makers should<lb/> be concerned about the consequences of health reform for the cost of private insurance.</div>
