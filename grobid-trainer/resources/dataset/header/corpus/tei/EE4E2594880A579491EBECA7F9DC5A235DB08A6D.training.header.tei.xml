	<div type="abstract">Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) stud-<lb/>ies have reported baseline (medication free) differences<lb/> between mood disorder patients and healthy control sub-<lb/>jects, but relatively little is known about relationships<lb/> between baseline PET scans and treatment responses.<lb/> Carbamazepine (CBZ) and to a more limited extent<lb/> nimodipine (NIMO) seem useful in mood disorders. We<lb/> explored whether baseline regional cerebral glucose me-<lb/>tabolism (rCMRglu) could discriminate CBZ and NIMO<lb/> responders from nonresponders and healthy control subjects.<lb/> Methods: In refractory mood disorder patients, we exam-<lb/>ined relationships between responses to these drugs,<lb/> assessed by Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores,<lb/> and baseline rCMRglu, determined with fluorine-18 deoxy-<lb/>glucose and PET.<lb/> Results: CBZ responders had baseline left insular hyper-<lb/>metabolism compared to healthy control subjects and<lb/> nonresponders, whereas nonresponders had widespread<lb/> (including left insular) hypometabolism. Degree of CBZ<lb/> response correlated with baseline paralimbic (including<lb/> insula) and prefrontal hypermetabolism. In responders but<lb/> not nonresponders, CBZ decreased widespread metabo-<lb/>lism, with the degree of decrease in left insula correlating<lb/> with response. In contrast, NIMO responders but not<lb/> nonresponders had baseline widespread (including left<lb/> insular) hypometabolism. Left prefrontal and left insular<lb/> baseline hypometabolism, but not metabolic changes with<lb/> treatment correlated with degree of NIMO response.<lb/> Conclusions: These data suggest that baseline anterior<lb/> paralimbic and prefrontal hypermetabolism may be asso-<lb/>ciated with CBZ response, and hypometabolism with<lb/> NIMO response. Based on these preliminary data, further<lb/> exploration of relationships between baseline PET scans<lb/>and treatment responses is indicated. </div>
