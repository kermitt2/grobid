	Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Background<lb/> Several sensitive methods are available for red blood cell (RBC) antibody screening.<lb/> Among these, gel and glass card systems have demonstrated comparably good perfor-<lb/>mance in retrospective studies and are widely used in routine patient diagnostics, but their<lb/> performance in prospective studies has not been sufficiently characterised.<lb/> Patients and methods<lb/> Gel card (Bio-Rad DiaMed) and glass bead-based (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics) column<lb/> agglutination technologies were used to screen for antibodies prospectively (group A) and<lb/> for antibody identification in stored and fresh samples known to contain RBC antibodies ret-<lb/>rospectively (group B). Untreated reagent RBCs and either papain-treated (Bio-Rad) or<lb/> ficin-treated panel C cells (Ortho) were used for antibody identification. Results<lb/> RBC-reactive antibodies were detected in 22 of 1000 group A samples, three of which<lb/> tested positive only by gel card agglutination, and four only by glass bead agglutination<lb/> (including one false positive each). Group B comprised 202 sera with known antibodies: 33<lb/> of these samples contained 36 antibodies detected only by gel card agglutination, whereas<lb/> 9 samples contained antibodies detectable only by glass bead-based agglutination. Dis-<lb/>crepancies mostly involved weak antibodies reactive by enzyme only. Two sera contained<lb/> antibody mixtures that neither system detected completely. Of note, in antibody differentia-<lb/>tion batches one and two, anti-Lu a was reactive in 7 of 7 and 1 of 8 samples, respectively. Conclusion<lb/> Both column agglutination tests for red cell antibodies had equal sensitivity and specificity<lb/> with unstored samples. In stored samples, weak and enzyme-only antibodies were more fre-<lb/>quently detected with the gel card system.<lb/></div>
