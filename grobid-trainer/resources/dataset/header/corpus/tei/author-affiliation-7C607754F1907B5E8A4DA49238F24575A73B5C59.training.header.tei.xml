	Abstract.
	<div type="abstract">The mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae),<lb/> originally indigenous to South-east Asia, islands of the Western Pacific and Indian<lb/> Ocean, has spread during recent decades to Africa, the mid-east, Europe and the<lb/> Americas (north and south) after extending its range eastwards across Pacific<lb/> islands during the early 20th century. The majority of introductions are apparently<lb/> due to transportation of dormant eggs in tyres. Among public health authorities in<lb/> the newly infested countries and those threatened with the introduction, there has<lb/> been much concern that Ae. albopictus would lead to serious outbreaks of arbo-<lb/>virus diseases (Ae. albopictus is a competent vector for at least 22 arboviruses),<lb/> notably dengue (all four serotypes) more commonly transmitted by Aedes (Stego-<lb/>myia) aegypti (L.). Results of many laboratory studies have shown that many<lb/> arboviruses are readily transmitted by Ae. albopictus to laboratory animals and<lb/> birds, and have frequently been isolated from wild-caught mosquitoes of this<lb/> species, particularly in the Americas. As Ae. albopictus continues to spread,<lb/> displacing Ae. aegypti in some areas, and is anthropophilic throughout its range,<lb/> it is important to review the literature and attempt to predict whether the medical<lb/> risks are as great as have been expressed in scientific journals and the popular<lb/> press. Examination of the extensive literature indicates that Ae. albopictus prob-<lb/>ably serves as a maintenance vector of dengue in rural areas of dengue-endemic<lb/> countries of South-east Asia and Pacific islands. Also Ae. albopictus transmits dog<lb/> heartworm Dirofilaria immitis (Leidy) (Spirurida: Onchocercidae) in South-east<lb/> Asia, south-eastern U.S.A. and both D. immitis and Dirofilaria repens (Raillet &amp;<lb/> Henry) in Italy. Despite the frequent isolation of dengue viruses from wild-caught<lb/> mosquitoes, there is no evidence that Ae. albopictus is an important urban vector<lb/> of dengue, except in a limited number of countries where Ae. aegypti is absent,<lb/> i.e. parts of China, the Seychelles, historically in Japan and most recently in<lb/> Hawaii. Further research is needed on the dynamics of the interaction between<lb/> Ae. albopictus and other Stegomyia species. Surveillance must also be maintained<lb/> on the vectorial role of Ae. albopictus in countries endemic for dengue and other<lb/> arboviruses (e.g. Chikungunya, EEE, Ross River, WNV, LaCrosse and other<lb/> California group viruses), for which it would be competent and ecologically suited<lb/> to serve as a bridge vector.<lb/></div>
