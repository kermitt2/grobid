	ABSTRACT:
	<div type="abstract">In this paper, the relative merits and limitations of two models of case<lb/> management (CM) are compared: &quot;aggressive&quot; and ~problem-focused&quot;. Although aggres-<lb/>sive CM has a well-established history of improving the community tenure of deinstitu-<lb/>tionalized patients, individuals participating in this treatment are likely to become<lb/> dependent on health care providers and hence require indeterminate assistance.<lb/> Problem-focused CM teaches patients how to identify and resolve community-based<lb/> predicaments thereby making them relatively more independent of the mental health<lb/> system. Patients receiving problem-focused CM, however, need reasonably competent<lb/> cognitive functions thereby ruling out participation of the most severely disabled<lb/> individuals. An interaction of the two approaches is proposed in which aggressive and<lb/> problem-focused CM is selected depending on the patient&apos;s current needs, cognitive<lb/> deficit, and level of social support.<lb/></div>
