	<div type="abstract">Breast density, a breast cancer risk factor, is a radiologic feature that reflects fibroglandular tissue content relative to breast area or<lb/> volume. Its histology is incompletely characterized. Here we use deep learning approaches to identify histologic correlates in<lb/> radiologically-guided biopsies that may underlie breast density and distinguish cancer among women with elevated and low<lb/> density. We evaluated hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained digitized images from image-guided breast biopsies (n = 852 patients).<lb/> Breast density was assessed as global and localized fibroglandular volume (%). A convolutional neural network characterized H&amp;E<lb/> composition. In total 37 features were extracted from the network output, describing tissue quantities and morphological structure.<lb/> A random forest regression model was trained to identify correlates most predictive of fibroglandular volume (n = 588).<lb/> Correlations between predicted and radiologically quantified fibroglandular volume were assessed in 264 independent patients. A<lb/> second random forest classifier was trained to predict diagnosis (invasive vs. benign); performance was assessed using area under<lb/> receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUC). Using extracted features, regression models predicted global (r = 0.94) and<lb/> localized (r = 0.93) fibroglandular volume, with fat and non-fatty stromal content representing the strongest correlates, followed by<lb/> epithelial organization rather than quantity. For predicting cancer among high and low fibroglandular volume, the classifier<lb/> achieved AUCs of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively, with epithelial organizational features ranking most important. These results suggest<lb/> non-fatty stroma, fat tissue quantities and epithelial region organization predict fibroglandular volume. The model holds promise<lb/> for identifying histological correlates of cancer risk in patients with high and low density and warrants further evaluation.<lb/></div>
