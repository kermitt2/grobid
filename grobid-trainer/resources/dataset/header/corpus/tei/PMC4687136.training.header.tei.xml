	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Metastasis-associated gene 1(MTA1) has been identified as an oncogene in many tumors, and<lb/> aberrant MTA1 expression has been linked to carcinogenesis and metastasis. We aim to investigate the mechanism<lb/> of MTA1 and metastasis in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).<lb/> Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical staining were employed to detect<lb/> MTA1 and E-cadherin expression in MPM tissues and corresponding adjacent tissues. Stable clone with knock-down<lb/> of MTA1 was generated with shRNA via lentivirus technology in MPM cell lines. Wound-healing assay, transwell<lb/> assay and PCR array were carried out for detecting invasion and migration of MPM cells. Luciferase reporter assay<lb/> was performed to validate the effect of MTA1 on E-cadherin.<lb/> Results: MTA1 expression is up-regulated in MPM and shown a negative correlation with E-cadherin expression.<lb/> MTA1 could enhance the invasion and migration of MPM cells via suppressing the expression of E-cadherin. MTA1<lb/> overexpression is associated with pathology, metastasis and survival rate of MPM patients.<lb/> Conclusions: MTA1 plays an important role in Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to promote metastasis via<lb/> suppressing E-cadherin expression, resulting in a poor prognosis in MPM. MTA1 is a novel biomarker and indicative<lb/> of a poor prognosis in MPM patients.<lb/></div>
