	<div type="abstract">Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive form of breast cancer, and is associated with a poor prognosis due to<lb/> frequent distant metastasis and lack of effective targeted therapies. Previously, we identified maternal embryonic leucine zipper<lb/> kinase (MELK) to be highly expressed in TNBCs as compared with ER-positive breast cancers. Here we determined the molecular<lb/> mechanism by which MELK is overexpressed in TNBCs. Analysis of publicly available data sets revealed that MELK mRNA is elevated<lb/> in p53-mutant breast cancers. Consistent with this observation, MELK protein levels are higher in p53-mutant vs. p53 wild-type<lb/> breast cancer cells. Furthermore, inactivation of wild-type p53, by loss or mutation of the p53 gene, increases MELK expression,<lb/> whereas overexpression of wild-type p53 in p53-null cells reduces MELK promoter activity and MELK expression. We further<lb/> analyzed MELK expression in breast cancer data sets and compared that with known wild-type p53 target genes. This analysis<lb/> revealed that MELK expression strongly correlates with genes known to be suppressed by wild-type p53. Promoter deletion studies<lb/> identified a p53-responsive region within the MELK promoter that did not map to the p53 consensus response elements, but to a<lb/> region containing a FOXM1-binding site. Consistent with this result, knockdown of FOXM1 reduced MELK expression in p53-mutant<lb/> TNBC cells and expression of wild-type p53 reduced FOXM1 expression. ChIP assays demonstrated that expression of wild-type p53<lb/> reduces binding of E2F1 (a critical transcription factor controlling FOXM1 expression) to the FOXM1 promoter, thereby, reducing<lb/> FOXM1 expression. These results show that wild-type p53 suppresses FOXM1 expression, and thus MELK expression, through<lb/> indirect mechanisms. Overall, these studies demonstrate that wild-type p53 represses MELK expression by inhibiting E2F1A-<lb/>dependent transcription of FOXM1 and that mutation-driven loss of wild-type p53, which frequently occurs in TNBCs, induces MELK<lb/> expression by suppressing FOXM1 expression and activity in p53-mutant breast cancers.<lb/></div>
