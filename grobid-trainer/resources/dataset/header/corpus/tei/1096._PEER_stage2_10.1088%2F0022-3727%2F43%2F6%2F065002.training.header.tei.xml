	Abstract.
	<div type="abstract">Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) is predicted to be half metallic at room temperature and it shows the<lb/> highest Curie temperature among oxides. The use of Fe 3 O 4 thin films is therefore promising for<lb/> spintronic devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions and magnetoresistive sensors. The structural,<lb/> magnetic, and magnetotransport properties of magnetite are reported to be strongly dependent on the<lb/> growth conditions. We have developed a very simple deposition chamber for growing thin magnetite<lb/> films via a chemical vapor deposition process based on the Fe 3 (CO) 12 carbonyl precursor. The<lb/> structural, morphological and magnetic properties of the as deposited Fe 3 O 4 films have been<lb/> investigated by means of time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, grazing incidence X-ray<lb/> diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, atomic force microscopy, conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy,<lb/> and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Magnetotransport measurements<lb/> show magnetoresistance up to -2.4% at room temperature at the maximum applied field of 1.1 T.<lb/> Resistivity measurements in the 100-300 K temperature range reveal that the magnetotransport<lb/> properties of the Fe 3 O 4 films are governed by inter-granular tunneling of the spin polarized electrons.<lb/> The spin polarization is estimated to be around -16%. A possible route for increasing the spin-<lb/>polarized performances of our magnetite films is proposed. We have also deposited Fe 3 O 4 /MgO/Co<lb/> stacks by using a combined chemical vapor-and atomic layer-deposition process. The trilayer&apos;s<lb/> hysteresis curve evidences the presence of two distinct switching fields making it promising for<lb/> magnetite-based magnetic tunnel junction applications.<lb/></div>
