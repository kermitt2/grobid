	<div type="abstract">A major unanswered question is how a TCR discriminates between foreign and self-peptides presented on the APC surface. Here,<lb/> we used in situ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the distances of single TCR-pMHC bonds and the<lb/> conformations of individual TCR-CD3ζ receptors at the membranes of live primary T cells. We found that a TCR discriminates<lb/> between closely related peptides by forming single TCR-pMHC bonds with different conformations, and the most potent pMHC<lb/> forms the shortest bond. The bond conformation is an intrinsic property that is independent of the binding affinity and kinetics,<lb/> TCR microcluster formation, and CD4 binding. The bond conformation dictates the degree of CD3ζ dissociation from the inner<lb/> leaflet of the plasma membrane via a positive calcium signaling feedback loop to precisely control the accessibility of CD3ζ ITAMs<lb/> for phosphorylation. Our data revealed the mechanism by which a TCR deciphers the structural differences among peptides via the<lb/> TCR-pMHC bond conformation.<lb/></div>
