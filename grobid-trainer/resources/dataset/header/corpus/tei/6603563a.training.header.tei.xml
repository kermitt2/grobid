	<div type="abstract">Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterised pathologically by a marked desmoplastic stromal reaction that significantly<lb/> reduces the sensitivity and specificity of cytogenetic analysis. To identify genetic alterations that reflect the characteristics of the<lb/> tumour in vivo, we screened a total of 23 microdissected PDAC tissue samples using array-based comparative genomic hybridisation<lb/> (array CGH) with 1 Mb resolution. Highly stringent statistical analysis enabled us to define the regions of nonrandom genomic<lb/> changes. We detected a total of 41 contiguous regions (43.0 Mb) of copy number changes, such as a genetic gain at 7p22.2 -p15.1<lb/> (26.0 Mb) and losses at 17p13.3 -p11.2 (13.6 Mb), 18q21.2 -q22.1 (12.0 Mb), 18q22.3 -q23 (7.1 Mb) and 18q12.3 -q21.2 (6.9 Mb).<lb/> To validate our array CGH results, fluorescence in situ hybridisation was performed using four probes from those regions, showing<lb/> that these genetic alterations were observed in 37 -68% of a separate sample set of 19 PDAC cases. In particular, deletion of the<lb/> SEC11L3 gene (18q21.32) was detected at a very high frequency (13 out of 19 cases; 68%) and in situ RNA hybridisation for this gene<lb/> demonstrated a significant correlation between deletion and expression levels. It was further confirmed by reverse transcription -<lb/>PCR that SEC11L3 mRNA was downregulated in 16 out of 16 PDAC tissues (100%). In conclusion, the combination of tissue<lb/> microdissection and array CGH provided a valid data set that represents in vivo genetic changes in PDAC. Our results raise the<lb/> possibility that the SEC11L3 gene may play a role as a tumour suppressor in this disease.<lb/></div>
