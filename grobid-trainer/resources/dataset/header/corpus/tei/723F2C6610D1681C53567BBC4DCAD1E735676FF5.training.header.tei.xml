	<div type="abstract">Background. Anemia is associated with increased mortality risk. The impact of mildly low hemoglobin concentration<lb/> (Hb) on risk for mortality remains unclear, especially among blacks. We examined the racial differences between Hb and<lb/> mortality.<lb/> Methods. This was a population-based study conducted from 1993 through 2006, in a geographically defined<lb/> community of Chicago, Illinois. A stratified, random sample of 1806 participants 65 years old or older and 50% black,<lb/> who were participating in the Chicago Health Aging Project and underwent clinical evaluation. Mortality was ascertained<lb/> using the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the independent relation of Hb to<lb/> mortality risk.<lb/> Results. The proportion of participants with anemia by World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (Hb , 13.0 g/dL for<lb/> men and , 12.0 g/dL for women) was 39% among blacks, and 17% among whites. Blacks had lower mean Hb (12.6 6 1.5<lb/> g/dL) than did whites (13.5 6 1.5 g/dL). In multivariable analysis, anemia was associated with increased mortality risk in<lb/> blacks (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.43-2.53) and in whites (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.32-2.59).<lb/> Among blacks, Hb 0-0.9 g/dL below the anemia threshold is associated with increased mortality risk compared to Hb 0-0.9<lb/> g/dL above the anemia cutoff (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.21-2.79), Hb 1.1-2.0 g/dL above the anemia cutoff (HR, 1.35; 95% CI,<lb/> 0.88-2.05) and Hb 2.1-3.0 g/dL above the anemia cutoff (HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.12-4.47). The terms for interaction between<lb/> black ethnicity/race and anemia suggested that blacks did not have a statistically significant difference in mortality risk<lb/> compared to whites. Subgroup analyses of interaction terms suggested that Hb 0.1-1.0 g/dL above anemia cutoff group,<lb/> blacks may have lower mortality risk compared to whites in the mildly low normal ranges of Hb (p ¼ .02).<lb/> Conclusion. Both anemia by WHO criteria and mild reductions in Hb were related to increased risk of mortality in<lb/> older blacks and whites.<lb/></div>
