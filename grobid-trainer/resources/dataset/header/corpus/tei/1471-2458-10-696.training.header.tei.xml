	Abstract<lb/>
	<div type="abstract">Background: Prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women shows regional variations not explained by<lb/> common risk factors. Analysis of CVD incidence will provide insight into whether there is further divergence<lb/> between regions with increasing age.<lb/> Methods: Seven-year follow-up data on 2685 women aged 59-80 (mean 69) at baseline from 23 towns in the UK<lb/> were available from the British Women&apos;s Heart and Health Study. Time to fatal or non-fatal CVD was analyzed using<lb/> Cox regression with adjustment for risk factors, using multiple imputation for missing values.<lb/> Results: Compared to South England, CVD incidence is similar in North England (HR 1.05 (95% CI 0.84, 1.31)) and<lb/> Scotland (0.93 (0.68, 1.27)), but lower in Midlands/Wales (0.85 (0.64, 1.12)). Event severity influenced regional<lb/> variation, with South England showing lower fatal incident CVD than other regions, but higher non-fatal incident<lb/> CVD. Kaplan-Meier plots suggested that regional divergence in CVD occurred before baseline (before mean<lb/> baseline age of 69).<lb/> Conclusions: In women, regional differences in CVD early in adult life do not further diverge in later life. This may<lb/> be due to regional differences in early detection, survivorship of women entering the study, or event severity.<lb/> Targeting health care resources for CVD by geographic variation may not be appropriate for older age-groups.<lb/></div>
