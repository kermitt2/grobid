	Abstract
	<div type="abstract">Describes a study which applied the stages of change model formulated by Prochaska<lb/> and DiClemente to consumer use of food labels. A total of 165 students completed a self-report<lb/> questionnaire measuring stages of change, decisional balance, dietary behaviour and food choice<lb/> motivations. The percentage of participants classified into each stage was as follows:<lb/> precontemplation 30.0, contemplation 4.5, action 16.4 and maintenance 49.1. Significant<lb/> associations with stage of change and decisional balance were observed. In addition, consumption<lb/> of fruit and fatty foods was associated with stage of change as was a range of motivational<lb/> factors in food choice.<lb/> </div>
