Human skin undergoes certain normal cornification processes which give the skin its characteristic appearance.
Casual factors or external factors such as a raw climate, wind, photo-damage and irritation triggered by the sun, rain and snow, however, disturb this normal condition of the skin, and there appears a roughness, a formation of scales (for example on the scalp), an excessive keratinization and similar phenomena. Furthermore, in the course of aging of the skin various signs appear that are especially reflected by a change in the structure and function of the skin. One of these signs is the appearance of fine lines and deep wrinkles, the size and number of which increases with age. The micro relief of the skin becomes less uniform and is of anisotropic nature. In parallel with age the skin becomes more sensitive towards disturbing influences, either intrinsic or extrinsic, which may result in itch, redness or even darker spots, particular on hands and the facial area due to pigmentation disorders. These unwanted signs may lead to an undesired age judgment of a person.
Cosmetic preparations are essentially useful for skin care. One aim of skin care in the cosmetic sense is to strengthen or rebuild the skin's natural function as a barrier against environmental influences (e.g. UV-light, dirt, chemicals, microorganisms) and against the loss of endogenous substances (e.g. <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007039059.HC.chemical-names.643" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:COMPOUND:5421" name="water" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:15377" relevant="false">water</ne>, natural <ne id="WO2007039059.HC.class-names.58" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:322" name="lipids" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:18059" relevant="false" type="CLASS">lipids</ne>, electrolytes). If this function becomes impaired, increased resorption of toxic or allergenic substances or attack by microorganisms may result, leading to toxic or allergic skin reactions.
Another aim of skin care is to compensate for the loss by the skin of <ne id="WO2007039059.HC.class-names.59" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:322" name="lipids" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:18059" relevant="false" type="CLASS">lipids</ne> and <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007039059.HC.chemical-names.644" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:COMPOUND:5421" name="water" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:15377" relevant="false">water</ne> caused by daily washing. This is particularly important, if the natural regeneration ability is inadequate. Furthermore, skin care products should protect against environmental influences, in particular against sun and wind, and delay skin aging.
Strengthening or thickening of the epidermis together with an optimized skin barrier <ne id="WO2007039059.HC.class-names.128" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:481" name="lipid" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:18059" relevant="false" type="CLASS">lipid</ne> synthesis can rebuild the skin's barrier ability and is therefore of significant cosmetic value. Reduced transepidermal <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007039059.HC.chemical-names.645" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:COMPOUND:5421" name="water" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:15377" relevant="false">water</ne> loss (TEWL) is a sign of an intact <ne id="WO2007039059.HC.class-names.129" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:481" name="lipid" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:18059" relevant="false" type="CLASS">lipid</ne> barrier, which acts also as first defense line to protect against the appearance of skin wrinkles.
Another strategy to fight wrinkles is to stimulate the collagen synthesis in the dermis. A number of degenerative processes act on the collagen matrix and is triggered by extrinsic factors like UV radiation, pollution in general and particular cigarette smoke or intrinsic factors leading to any chronic or sub chronic inflammation. Destruction and/or impaired repair efficacy leads to a denser and less elastic macro structure of the dermis, which in turn leads to the formation of deep wrinkles. Enhancing the de novo synthesis of collagen or other structural proteins of the dermis is considered a valuable therapy to reduce the existing wrinkles and to protect against the appearance of new wrinkles.
Of particular importance for anti-aging cosmetics is to inhibit the senescence of skin cells in order to keep their regular metabolic level on a constant and beneficial level.
Hair loss or alopecia is a common affliction of humans. The most common form of hair loss in both males and females is patterned baldness or androgenic alopecia.
Hair follicles range in size from small, superficial, vellus follicles to large, deep, terminal follicles. The cyclic growth phases of hair follicles are telogen (resting), anagen l-lll (developing), anagen IV-VI (growing) and catagen (involuting).
In the development of androgenic alopecia there is the gradual diminution of follicle size, with conversion of large, terminal follicles, producing thick, pigmented hair fibers (terminal hair) to small vellus follicles producing fine, non-pig mented hair fibers (vellus hair). In addition, the proportion of growing anagen follicles declines.
There exists a wide variety of literature regarding cosmetic preparations, in particular regarding cosmetic preparations for treating wrinkles and for promoting hair growth. As examples of the extensive literature it can be referred e.g. to GB 906,000, EP-A 699 429 or WO 03/086342.
While a variety of technologies exist to prevent and to fight the signs of skin aging, to improve the appearance of the skin or to treat or prevent hair loss, there is still a demand for more efficacious ingredients.
The problem to be solved by the present invention is the provision of novel compounds, of compositions containing these novel compounds, in particular of cosmetic preparations which are particularly useful for treating and/or preventing wrinkles, thickening of the epidermis, and preventing and/or treating of hair loss, but also preparations which are useful against other conditions which are observed with skin aging due to environmental or other external influences or due to age.
The new compounds should have an activity which is comparable to the activity of known cosmetically active compounds but preferably is better than the activity of the prior art compounds. This problem is solved on the basis of the unexpected finding that certain arylalkyl carboxylic <ne id="WO2007039059.HC.class-names.8" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:524" name="acylates" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007039059:987924" relevant="false" type="CLASS">acylates</ne> with naturally occurring, non-toxic <ne type="LIGAND" id="WO2007039059.HC.ligand-names.60" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:LIGAND:1" name="hydroxyl" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:29191" relevant="false">hydroxyl</ne>, <ne type="LIGAND" id="WO2007039059.HC.ligand-names.5" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:LIGAND:439" name="sulfhydryl" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007039059:745032" relevant="false">sulfhydryl</ne>, <ne type="LIGAND" id="WO2007039059.HC.ligand-names.237" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:LIGAND:590" name="amino" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:46882" relevant="false">amino</ne> or <ne type="LIGAND" id="WO2007039059.HC.ligand-names.14" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:LIGAND:440" name="imino" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:29342" relevant="false">imino</ne> compounds show activity in cosmetic applications and related pharmaceutical applications, in particular for treating and preventing wrinkles and hair loss and thickening the epidermis, but also for ameliorating the effects of aging of the skin, which may be caused by external or environmental hazards or by the natural aging of the skin.
Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention is concerned with compounds represented by general formula (I) as shown above.
In another aspect, the invention is concerned with compositions, particularly cosmetic preparations comprising a compound of the formula (I). In still another aspect, the invention is concerned with the use of the compounds of formula (I) for treating and preventing wrinkles and hair loss and thickening the epidermis, but also for ameliorating the effects of aging of the skin, which may be caused by external or environmental hazards or by the natural aging of the skin, and with a method of treating and preventing the aforesaid conditions by administering an effective amount of a topical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) on the appropriate portions of the skin of an individual in need of such treatment.
In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treatment or prophylaxis of wrinkles or dry skin or sensitive skin or any symptoms caused by negative developments of the physiological homeostasis of healthy skin, promotion of hair growth, protection from hair loss, a thickening of the epidermis, anti-acne, the inhibition of senescence of skin cells, prevention or treatment of photo damage, prevention or treatment of oxidative stress phenomena, prevention or treatment of cellulite, prevention or treatment of pigmentation disorders and/or even the skin tone, prevention and treatment of disturbances in <ne id="WO2007039059.HC.class-names.125" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:545" name="ceramide" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:17761" relevant="false" type="CLASS">ceramide</ne> and <ne id="WO2007039059.HC.class-names.130" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:481" name="lipid" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:18059" relevant="false" type="CLASS">lipid</ne> synthesis, prevention of excess sebum production, reduction of activities of matrix metallo proteases or other proteases in the skin, treatment and prevention of inflammatory skin conditions including atopic eczema, polymorphic light eruption, psoriasis, vertiligo, prevention and treatment of itchy or irritated skin, which comprises applying an effective amount of composition comprising a compound of formula (I) on the appropriate portions of the skin of the individual in need of such treatment.
The term 'an effective amount' refers to an amount necessary to obtain a physiological effect. The physiological effect may be achieved by one single application or by repeated applications. The dosage applied may, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the physiological characteristics of the particular composition and its mode and route of administration; the age, health and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the concentration of the compound of formula (I) in the topical composition; and the effect desired and can be adjusted by a person skilled in the art.
The amount of the topical composition which is to be applied to the skin depends on the concentration of the active ingredients, i.e. the compound of formula (I), in the compositions and the desired cosmetic or pharmaceutical effect. For example, application can be such that a creme is applied to the skin. A creme is usually applied in an amount of 2 mg creme/cm&lt;2&gt; skin. The amount of the composition which is applied to the skin is, however, not critical, and if with a certain amount of applied composition the desired effect cannot be achieved, a higher concentration of the active ingredients can be used e.g. by applying more of the composition or by applying compositions which contain more active ingredient.

In accordance of the present invention, the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared in a manner known per se, e.g. as disclosed in the Examples or in analogy thereto. Generally, the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by acylating a compound of the formula XH, wherein X is as defined above, with a compound of the formula <ne type="FORMULA" id="WO2007039059.HC.formula-names.5" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:FORMULA:121" name="Ph-(CH2)n-COOH" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007039059:312191" relevant="false">Ph-(CH2)n-COOH</ne> or a reactive derivative thereof.

If required, any groups reactive to the acylating agent which are not intended to be acylated have to be protected. Therefore the acylation of polyfunctional molecules requires versatile protecting groups that can be easily introduced which are orthogonally stable to each other and can be selectively removed under mild conditions. A good selection of the most useful protecting groups for functional and potentially reactive groups which can be easily applied for the above mentioned purpose by people skilled in the art can be found e.g. in P. J. Kocienski, Protecting Groups, 2000, Corrected Edition, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, New York and T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3&lt;rd&gt; Edition, 1999, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York.

The ability of the compounds and compositions of the present invention to stimulate or protect hair growth can be determined with a mouse model described for example in WO 9817273. Instead of using Cyclophosphamide (Neostar, Pharmacia) to damage hair follicle Mitomycin, or Methotrexate can be used. It is also possible to detect hair growth acceleration with newborn mice. They have a synchronized hair cycle and approximately after 3 weeks all hair follicles go into the telogen phase. Then the animals are treated and it is evaluated how fast and to what extend the hair is growing Similar tests using in vitro or in vivo setups can also be found in J. Invest. Dermato. symposium proceedings 3rd Int. Meeting of Hair Research Societies, 8/1 , p.39 - 45 (2003).
It also is possible to perform a clinical study including males suffering from alopecia using the TrichoScan analysis tool described in R. Hoffmann, J. Invest. Dermato. symposium proceedings 3rd Int. Meeting of Hair Research Societies, 8/1 , p.109-115 (2003).
The compositions of the present invention can also be in the form of injectable compositions, in particular if the compositions are for promoting hair growth. The preparation of injectable compositions is known to a skilled person, and it can be referred to the pertinent literature, in particular to Remington already cited above.
The compounds of formula (I) can also be present as hydrates or solvates, and the hydrates and solvates of the active ingredients are also encompassed by the present invention.
