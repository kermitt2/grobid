BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
</P>
<P>[0002] The present invention relates generally to methods for using dental compositions containing polymerizable resins and <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.75" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:758" name="fluorescent compounds" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:38731" relevant="false">fluorescent compounds</ne>. The dental compositions can be used as flowable composites (fillings), adhesives, sealants, and the like. The dental compositions are preferably used as dental sealants.
Brief Description of the Related Art
</P>
<P>[0003] Dental professionals apply a sealant to the surface of a tooth in order to provide long-term protection against dental caries, which is caused by the accumulation of bacteria. The bacteria in plaque produce acids that eat into the tooth, eventually causing cavities to form therein. Pits and fissures may develop in the surface of a tooth, and bacteria tend to accumulate in these areas. Sealants are commonly used to fill the pits and fissures in the surface of a tooth, particularly the occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth. The sealants, once applied and cured, provide a smooth seal and prevent the ingress of fluids, food, and debris. The sealant can either have a clear composition or opaque composition to match the color of the tooth. Both types of sealant compositions tend to have a glossy surface finish and provide an aesthetically-pleasing appearance.
</P>
<P>[0004] The dental professional must apply the sealant carefully so that it completely seals the pits and fissures in the surface of the tooth. Typically, the sealant is applied with a brush or other applicator. Then, the sealant is cured and hardened. The curing step normally involves irradiating the sealant with blue visible light having a wavelength generally in the range of about 400 to about 700 nm. The application and curing of the sealant can be difficult. When a clear sealant composition is used, the dentist may have trouble discerning between the pits and fissures, which need to be sealed, versus healthy dentition.
It also can be difficult to apply an opaque sealant composition, because the color of the sealant composition and natural color of the tooth can be substantially the same. Another problem with some conventional sealants is that they tend to wear-away over time. When the dentist examines the patient in follow-up visits, he or she may not be able to easily detect if portions of the sealant have worn off. As part of an effort to address these problems, the dental industry has developed dental sealants containing fluorescing compounds. With these fluorescing sealants, the dental professional is better able to check margins and determine if the sealant has been placed accurately on the surface of the tooth during initial patient visits. In follow-up visits, the dentist can examine the patient's tooth, under fluorescing conditions, to determine if the sealant has worn off.
</P>
<P>[0004] For example, Schwartz, U.S. Patent 4,600,389 discloses dental compositions used for making restorations, inlays, onlays, crowns, sealants, glazes, and cements. The composition contains microbeads having a fluorescent rare earth chelated compound therein. The fluorescent rare earth compound is permanently isolated within the microbeads. The composition is colorless when viewed under ordinary daylight, sunlight, or disco light but is highly fluorescent when exposed to ultraviolet radiation having a wavelength of 300 to 400 ran according to the '389 Patent.
</P>
<P>[0005] Rheinberger et al., U.S. Patent 5,102,461 relates to a colorless dental material that can be distinguished from natural teeth, false teeth, and other dental materials. The colorless dental material includes a fluorescent substance that emits fluorescent light as a result of being irradiated with radiation having a wavelength in the region of 360 to 480
nm. Suitable dental materials, which can be made in accordance with the '461 Patent,
include spacer varnishes, blocking materials, composite filling materials, cements, and sealants. The dental material is irradiated with light having a wavelength in the region of 360 to 480 nm, and the material is viewed through a light filter. The '461 Patent teaches
that the interfering effects caused by reflection of the irradiating light (360 to 480 nm) and the natural fluorescence of teeth are overcome by using the light filter. [0006] Robinson et al., U.S. Patent 5,211,748 discloses a dental restorative composition containing an additive that fluoresces under radiation having a wavelength in the visible light spectrum. The preferred additive is <ne type="CHEMICAL" id="WO2007041477.HC.chemical-names.75" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:COMPOUND:7449" name="chromium" comment="" chebi-id="CHEBI:28073" relevant="false">chromium</ne>-activated "crushed ruby." According
to the '748 Patent, a conventional light source, such as a blue light used for curing dental
composites, can be used to irradiate the composition with the required visible light. The ruby additive fluoresces when irradiated by visible-wavelength light but does not fluoresce when irradiated by ultra-violet light.
</P>
<P>[0007] Although some of the foregoing dental compositions can be used effectively as dental sealants, there is still a need for an improved composition. It would be particularly desirable to use a <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.1" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:197" name="fluorescent compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:266431" relevant="false">fluorescent compound</ne>, which does not impart any substantial color to the composition. The sealant, containing the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.2" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:197" name="fluorescent compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:266431" relevant="false">fluorescent compound</ne>, would maintain its ordinary color after it had been applied to the surface of the tooth and while it was in an uncured condition. The sealant would maintain this same color after it had been cured. It also would be desirable to have a composition, which would fluoresce upon being irradiated with ultraviolet light, but would revert quickly to its ordinary color when it was no longer exposed to the ultraviolet light. The present invention provides a dental sealant having these desirable properties as well as other features and advantages.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
</P>
<P>[0008] The present invention provides a method of applying a dental composition to tooth surfaces. A dental composition comprising polymerizable resin and <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.86" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:1012" name="fluorescing compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:204028" relevant="false">fluorescing compound</ne> is provided. The composition is applied to a tooth surface and cured so that it substantially hardens. Then, the composition is irradiated with a light source emitting light at a wavelength in the ultraviolet spectrum of about 200 to about 400 nm. The composition is visually identified by observing the composition emitting fluorescence having a wavelength in the visible spectrum of greater than about 400 nm. This allows the dental practitioner to distinguish the area of the tooth containing the composition from remaining natural areas of the tooth surface.

The composition is preferably used as a dental sealant that provides a hard, glossy surface finish over a tooth. The sealant exhibits a bright fluorescent glow immediately upon being exposed to ultraviolet light. The sealant reverts immediately to its natural color when it is no longer exposed to the ultraviolet light. Only a low dosage of ultraviolet light is needed to excite the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.4" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:197" name="fluorescent compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:266431" relevant="false">fluorescent compound</ne> in the composition.

Conventional dispensing syringes, applicators, brushes, and other delivery devices can be used to apply the composition to the desired area of the tooth or pre-existing dental restoration. In one embodiment, the composition is provided in a single cartridge, which is inserted into a barrel of a dispensing syringe. In practice, a dentist pushes on the plunger of the syringe to force the composition from the cartridge and through a dispensing tip. The composition is dispensed onto the targeted area of the tooth or dental restoration in this manner. Then, the composition can be cured or hardened by irradiating the composition with visible light radiation.

The fluorescent glow of the sealant allows the dentist to better check margins and accurately apply the sealant to only those areas of the tooth, where treatment is needed.
During follow-up visits with the patient, the dentist can irradiate the tooth with ultraviolet radiation.

[0026] The compositions of this invention can be used as various dental materials including, for example, as flowable composites (fillings), adhesives, sealants, and the like. Preferably, the composition is used as a dental sealant for sealing pits and fissures in the surface of a tooth. The sealant can have either a clear or opaque composition. The sealant is applied to the surface of the tooth so that it provides a smooth and glossy surface finish. The sealant coating is hard and non-tacky.
In addition, the sealant coating has good mechanical strength, wear-resistance, and adhesion strength. The sealant may be applied to the surface of a tooth using methods well known in the art. First, the surface of the tooth is cleaned thoroughly. Prophylaxis pastes can be used to clean the surface of the tooth. Secondly, the surface of the tooth is dried with cotton rolls, an air syringe, or other appropriate materials. Thirdly, the surface of the tooth is acid-etched. Liquid etchant can be brushed onto the surface of the tooth to prepare an etched surface. Then, the surface of the tooth is dried again. Fourthly, the sealant is applied to the etched surface of the tooth with a brush or other suitable applicator. The uncured dental sealant has a syrup-like consistency. The dental sealant of this invention preferably has an off- white color. But, it should be recognized that the sealant might be formulated so that it has any suitable color. Colorants may be added to the sealant composition to modify the color as desired. The <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.87" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:1012" name="fluorescing compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:204028" relevant="false">fluorescing compound</ne> imparts no substantial color to the sealant. Finally, the sealant is cured by irradiating it with visible blue light having a wavelength in the range of about 400 to about 800 nm. A standard blue light dental-curing lamp can be used to cure the sealant. The color of the sealant remains substantially the same even when the sealant has been cured with visible light. For example, if the sealant has a natural off-white color when it is in an uncured state, its color will remain off-white after the curing step has been completed.
</P>
<P>[0027] When the dentist wishes to check the placement of the sealant, he or she irradiates the sealant with ultraviolet light having a wavelength in the range of about 200 run to about 400 nm. Preferably, ultraviolet light having a wavelength in the range of about 365 nm to about 390 nm is used. As discussed above, energy in the ultraviolet light spectrum is used to excite the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.79" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:758" name="fluorescent compounds" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:38731" relevant="false">fluorescent compounds</ne>. In turn, the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.80" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:758" name="fluorescent compounds" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:38731" relevant="false">fluorescent compounds</ne>, will emit energy in the visible light spectrum at a level sufficient to provide a fluorescent glow, particularly a bluish - white fluorescent glow. The response to the ultraviolet light is immediate.
An unaided human eye instantaneously sees the fluorescent glow of the sealant composition once the composition is exposed to ultraviolet light. The fluorescent glow of the composition is bright and clear, and a human observer can immediately discern materials that contain the composition over non-fluorescing materials. Moreover, the dentist can inspect a tooth and easily distinguish between the areas of the tooth, which have been treated with the sealant of this invention, versus those areas, which have not been treated with the sealant. The dentist removes the ultraviolet light source after completing his or her examination of the patient. Immediately at this point, when the tooth is no longer exposed to the ultraviolet light, the sealant reverts to its ordinary color (for example, off-white). The response to removing the ultraviolet light source is instantaneous.
An unaided human eye will instantaneously observe the natural color of the sealant composition once the ultraviolet light source has been removed. [0028] Any light source, which emits ultraviolet light, such as, for example, lamps, flashlights, lasers, light-emitting diodes, and the like can be used to illuminate the sealant composition of this invention. For example, a light-emitting, stylus-like device can be used as the ultraviolet light source. The stylus-like device is preferably lightweight and battery-operated. The stylus-like device contains light-emitting diodes that emit ultraviolet radiation. Generally, such stylus-like devices are easier to handle and operate than standard visible-light dental curing lamps. Furthermore, since the compositions of this invention respond immediately upon being exposed to the ultraviolet light, only a low dosage of ultraviolet radiation is needed. A dentist can grasp the stylus-like device and focus the ultraviolet light directly on the tooth or dental restoration. The dentist will immediately observe a fluorescent glow emanating from the tooth or restoration if the composition is present thereon.
</P>
<P>[0029] The dental compositions of the present invention have many advantageous properties and benefits including the following. First, the composition exhibits a fluorescent glow immediately upon being exposed to the ultraviolet light. Conversely, when the composition is no longer exposed to the ultraviolet light, it reverts immediately to its natural color. In other words, the composition has an instantaneous on/off fluorescence mechanism.
Secondly, the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.88" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:1012" name="fluorescing compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:204028" relevant="false">fluorescing compound</ne> imparts no substantial color to the sealant. Adding the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.16" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:197" name="fluorescent compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:266431" relevant="false">fluorescent compound</ne> to the sealant composition does not change the natural color of the composition. Thirdly, a light-emitting, stylus-like device can be used as the ultraviolet light source. The device is preferably lightweight and battery-operated. Only a low dosage of ultraviolet energy is needed to excite the <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.81" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:758" name="fluorescent compounds" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:38731" relevant="false">fluorescent compounds</ne> so that the composition gives off a fluorescent glow. Fourthly, the amount of <ne type="ONT" id="WO2007041477.HC.class-names.17" epochem-id="EPOCHEM:NEW:CLASS:197" name="fluorescent compound" comment="" chebi-id="WO2007041477:266431" relevant="false">fluorescent compound</ne>, which needs to be added to the composition to impart sufficient fluorescence, is relatively low.

</P>
<P>[0032] The ingredients were introduced into a planetary mixer at ambient temperature and mixed together. After the ingredients were mixed for one hour, they were processed through a colloid mill to break-up any agglomerates.
Lastly, the composition was mixed under vacuum to remove any entrained air. [0033] The resulting sealant composition was applied as a sealant to a set of mounted, extracted teeth that were used as test specimens. The composition was tested for fluorescence in its uncured and cured states. An ultraviolet light source was used to illuminate the sealant-coated teeth. The composition immediately exhibited a fluorescence glow upon being exposed to the ultraviolet light. The fluorescent regions of the tooth, where the sealant composition had been applied, were easily identifiable and distinguishable over natural dentition of the tooth. Once the ultraviolet light source was removed and the tooth no longer illuminated, the sealant composition immediately reverted to its natural off-white color. In addition, the sealant composition was tested for various physical properties and the results are reported below in Table 3.
