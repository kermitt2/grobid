# Troubleshooting and Frequently Asked Questions

## What is 500 `BAD_INPUT_DATA` or `NO_BLOCKS` error?

In short, this is not a critical error. 
For historical reasons, there are certain error 500 responses that are not critical errors; see [here](Grobid-service.md#errors-handling) for a more detailed explanation.
`BAD_INPUT_DATA` is likely a PDF document that cannot be converted because it is damaged or too big. `NO_BLOCKS` means that the PDF does not contain any text, and should be processed with OCR first.


## How to make sure that the GPU is being used 

If you are using the full Docker image (e.g. `grobid/grobid:0.8.2-full`), the GPU will be automatically detected on Linux if available; however, to be sure, we recommend using `nvtop` (similar to `htop` for CPU).

## How to avoid DeLFT TF to allocate the full GPU memory

By default, TensorFlow allocates all the GPU memory when it starts. 
This can be changed by setting the environment variable `TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH` to `true` before starting GROBID.
With docker, for example you can this command: 

```shell
docker run --rm --gpus all --init --ulimit core=0 -e TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH='true' -p 8070:8070 grobid/grobid:0.8.2-full
```

## When processing a large quantity of files, I see many `503` errors

The `503` status returned by GROBID is not an error, and does not mean that the server has issues. On the contrary, this is the mechanism to avoid the service from collapsing and to keep it up, alive, and running according to its capacity for days.

As described in the [documentation](Grobid-service.md#apiprocessfulltextdocument), the `503` status indicates that the service is currently using all its available threads, and the client should simply wait a bit before re-sending the query.

Exploiting the `503` mechanism is already implemented in the different GROBID clients listed [here](Grobid-service.md#clients-for-grobid-web-services).

## Timeout and 408 errors when running the client

Occasionally, [people have reported](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues/1234) timeout issues when using Grobid, especially when processing large quantities of PDF files locally. This can happen if the server takes too long to respond, leading to a 408 Request Timeout error. 

To resolve this issue, there are several options: 
 - Check that you are running the proper image for your hardware. If you are not sure, use the image `grobid/grobid:0.8.2-crf` which is the most lightweight and fastest image. 
 - Make sure you don't send too many requests at the same time, as this can overload the server. If you are using the Grobid Python client, you can set the `n` parameter to a lower value (e.g. 1 or 2) to limit the number of concurrent requests.
 - Increase the timeout value in your client. If you are using the Grobid Python client, you can set the `timeout` parameter to a higher value (e.g. 90 seconds) in the `config.json` to give the server more time to respond.

## Where are the logs? 

The logs of Grobid are located in `logs/grobid-service.log`. The console logs from Gradle are usually not very useful to understand the problem. 
When opening an issue, remember to attach the logs from `grobid-service.log` to the report.  


## Guidance for server configuration in production

The exact server configuration will depend on the service you want to call, the models selected in the Grobid configuration file (`grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml`), and the availability of GPU. We consider here the complete full text processing of PDF (`processFulltextDocument`). 

1) Using lightweight image (CRF models only) without the needs of GPUs (docker image: `grobid/grobid:{version}-crf`): 

- in `grobid/grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml` set the parameter `concurrency` to your number of available threads at server side or slightly higher (e.g. 16 to 20 for a 16 threads-machine)

- keep the concurrency at the client (number of simultaneous calls) slightly higher than the available number of threads at the server side, for instance if the server has 16 threads, use a concurrency between 20 and 24 (it's the option `n` in the above mentioned clients)

These settings will ensure that CPU are fully used when processing a large set of PDF.  

For example, with these settings, we processed with `processFulltextDocument` around 10.6 PDF per second (around 915,000 PDF per day, around 20M pages per day) with the node.js client during one week on a 16 CPU machine (16 threads, 32GB RAM, no SDD). It ran without any crash during 7 days at this rate. We processed 11.3M PDF in a bit less than 7 days with two 16-CPU servers in one of our projects. 

!!! tip 
    If your server has 8-10 threads available, you can use the default settings of the docker image, otherwise you will need to modify the configuration file to tune the parameters, as [documented](Configuration.md).

2) Using the full image (with Deep Learning models, docker image: `grobid/grobid:{version}-full`):

2.1) If the server has a GPU

In case the server has a GPU, which has its own memory, the Deep Learning inferences are automatically parallelized on this GPU, without impacting the CPU and RAM memory. The settings given above in 1) can normally be use similarly.

2.2) If the server has CPU only

When Deep Learning models run as well on CPU as fallback, the CPU are used more intensively (DL models push CPU computations quite a lot), more irregularly (Deep Learning models are called at certain point in the overall process, but not continuously) and the CPU will use additional RAM memory to load those larger models. For the DL inference on CPU, an additional thread is created, allocating its own memory. We can have up to 2 times more CPU used at peaks, and approx. up to 50% more memory. 

The settings should thus be considered as follow: 

- in `grobid/grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml` set the parameter `concurrency` to your number of available threads at server side divided by 2 (8 threads available, set concurrency to `4`)

- keep the concurrency at the client (number of simultaneous calls) at the same level as the `concurrency` parameter at server side, for instance if the server has 16 threads, use a `concurrency` of `8` and the client concurrency at `8` (it's the option `n` in the clients)

In addition, consider more RAM memory when running Deep Learning model on CPU, e.g. 24-32GB memory with concurrency at `8` instead of 16GB.

3) In general, consider also these settings:

- Set `modelPreload` to `true` in `grobid/grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml`, it will avoid some strange behavior at launch (this is the default setting).

- Regarding the query parameters, `consolidateHeader` can be `1`  or `2` if you are using the biblio-glutton or CrossRef consolidation. It significantly improves the accuracy and add useful metadata.

- If you want to consolidate all the bibliographical references and use `consolidateCitations` as `1` or `2`, the CrossRef query rate limit will make the scaling to more than 1 document per second impossible (so Grobid would typically wait 90% or more of its time waiting for CrossRef API responses)... For scaling the bibliographical reference resolutions, you will need to use a local consolidation service, [biblio-glutton](https://github.com/kermitt2/biblio-glutton). The overall capacity will depend on the biblio-glutton service then, and the number of elasticsearch nodes you can exploit. From experience, it is difficult to go beyond 300K PDF per day when using consolidation for every extracted bibliographical references. 

See [full thread](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues/443).

## Memory constraints and Out of Memory errors

In case of running on limited memory hardware, there are various ways to deal with memory constraints in Grobid:

- reduce the number of parallel threads on server side in grobid/grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml change the parameter `concurrency` (default is `10`, this is the max size of the thread pool that is reported in the logs)

- reduce the number of parallel processing at client side: this is the parameter `n` in the grobid python client command line

- reduce the maximum amount of memory dedicated to the PDF parsing by pdfalto: in `grobid/grobid-home/config/grobid.yaml` change the parameter `memory_limit_mb` a lower amount (note: not too low, PDF parsing remains memory-hungry).


## I would also like to extract images from PDFs

You will get the embedded images converted into `.png` by using the normal batch command. For instance:

```console
java -Xmx4G -Djava.library.path=grobid-home/lib/lin-64:grobid-home/lib/lin-64/jep -jar grobid-core/build/libs/grobid-core-0.8.2-onejar.jar -gH grobid-home -dIn ~/test/in/ -dOut ~/test/out -exe processFullText 
```

There is a web service doing the same, returning everything in a big zip file, `processFulltextAssetDocument`, still usable but deprecated.

A simpler option, if you are only interested in raw text and images, is to use directly [pdfalto](https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto).


## pdfalto is GPL, it is used by and shipped with GROBID which is Apache 2, is it okay in term of licensing?

We think there is no issue. First because GROBID calls the pdfalto binary as external command line - so there is similar to chaintools/scripts (which can be Apache/MIT) with external command line calls (calling most of the time also GPL stuff on Linux). More precisely:

- GROBID and pdfalto are two different programs in the sense of FSF, see last paragraph [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation): 

```text
By contrast, pipes, sockets and command-line arguments are communication mechanisms normally 
used between two separate programs. So when they are used for communication, the modules 
normally are separate programs. 
```

Linking libraries, for instance with a JNI, would have required a LGPL, but here we don't link libraries, share address space, and so on. 

- pdfalto can be aggregated in the same "grobid" distribution, see GPL faq [Mere Aggregation](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation)

```text
The GPL permits you to create and distribute an aggregate, even when the licenses of the 
other software are nonfree or GPL-incompatible. The only condition is that you cannot 
release the aggregate under a license that prohibits users from exercising rights that 
each program's individual license would grant them.
```

For convenience, it is no problem to ship the pdfalto executables with GROBID - same as a docker image which ships typically a mixture of GPL and Apache/MIT stuff calling each others like crazy and much more "deeply" than in our case.

Finally, as the two source codes are shipped in different repo with clear licensing information, exercising the rights that each program's individual license grants them is fully respected.

The only possible restriction would be:

```text
But if the semantics of the communication are intimate enough, exchanging complex 
internal data structures, that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as 
combined into a larger program.
```

pdfalto produces ALTO files, which is a standard format. pdfalto can be used for many other purposes than GROBID. In return GROBID itself can support other inputs, like text or the old pdf2xml files, and could support ALTO files produced by other tools. So this restriction does not apply. 

### Windows related issues 

Grobid is developed and tested on Linux. Mac is also supported, although some components might behave slightly different due to the natural incompatibility of Apple with the rest of the world, and the availability on some proprietary fonts on this platform.   
 
Grobid running natively on Windows, unfortunately, is currently not anymore supported, due to lack of experience and time constraints. We recommend Windows users to use the the docker image (documented [here]()) and call the system via the REST API using one of the various [grobid clients](Grobid-service.md#clients-for-grobid-web-services).

Before opening a new issue which might be related to Windows, please check that it is not redundant [here](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AWindows-specific)

!!! warn "Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)"
    Please be aware that users have reported issues using the WSL mode in Windows to run Grobid. More details [here](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues/954).   

**NOTE**: If you are a developer using Windows and you like to help, please let us know. 


## Invalid model format

Using macOS 10.12 Sierra or higher with a non-default locales (e.g. French), you might get the following error: 
```
error: invalid model format
```

This is because Wapiti is not reading the binary files correctly (most likely due to some incompatibles introduced from OSX to macOS). 

As workaround, before launching GROBID, type in the console:
```
export LC_ALL=C
```

See [here](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues/142#issuecomment-253497513) the open issue. 

## Missing libxml2 library

**libxml2**: GROBID is currenly shipped with all the needed libraries (Mac and Linux 32/64 bit).

libxml2 is required by pdfalto, and is normally shipped by default on all standard installation (Ubuntu, Mac OSX, etc).

For minimal or cloud based / container system like Linode, AWS, Docker, etc. _libxml2_ might not be installed by default and should thus be installed as prerequisite.

See [here](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/issues/101) the open issue.
